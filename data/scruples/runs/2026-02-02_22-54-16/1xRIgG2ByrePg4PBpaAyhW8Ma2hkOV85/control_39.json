I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that the author went on a date, had good service, and told the manager how great the waitress was. The date didn't like it and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author's actions were intended as a compliment, right? They noticed the waitress did a good job, even after a minor spill, and wanted to let the manager know. But the date was upset by this. Why? Maybe because she felt it was unnecessary or maybe she was uncomfortable with the attention on the waitress. \n\nWait, the waitress was part of the date's environment. Maybe the date felt that the author was paying more attention to the waitress than to her. Or perhaps she found it awkward to have someone else being praised in their presence. Or maybe she thought it was a form of showing off, like the author was trying to impress the manager instead of her. \n\nBut the author's intention was to praise the waitress, not to impress the date. The waitress was happy with the compliment, which seems like a positive outcome. The manager appreciated the feedback too. So the action itself wasn't negative towards the waitress. \n\nHowever, the date's reaction is key here. The author's action might have been inappropriate in the context of the date. The date could have felt that the author was being inconsiderate by involving the manager in their personal time. It's possible that in the context of a date, bringing up the manager and complimenting a waitress might have shifted the focus away from their interaction. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Well, the act of complimenting someone's job performance isn't inherently wrong. However, maybe the timing or the situation was the issue. The date might have wanted more attention from the author, and the author's action took some focus off their time together. \n\nBut the author's action was directed at the waitress and the manager, not at the date. The date's reaction is her own response, and the author didn't mean to upset her. However, in the context of a date, it's possible that the author didn't consider how his actions might affect the date's feelings. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action was a mistake. If the goal was to make the date feel appreciated, then complimenting a waitress might not align with that. But if the author's intention was genuine and the waitress deserved it, then maybe the author isn't wrong. \n\nThe waitress's manager appreciated the feedback, so the action was positive in that regard. The date's reaction is a separate issue, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for doing something right. However, maybe the author should have considered the date's feelings and refrained from bringing the manager in during their time together. \n\nAlternatively, the date might have had her own issues, and the act of complimenting the waitress was just the trigger. The author's action might not be the main issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was a positive thing for the waitress, but perhaps he didn't consider the context of the date. However, since the action was appropriate towards the waitress and manager, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The date's reaction is more about her own feelings towards the situation rather than the author doing something objectively wrong. So answer B: No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
