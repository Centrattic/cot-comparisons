I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager. The situation is that the author went out on a date with a girl, had good service, and wanted to commend the waitress. But the date got upset and called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. He wanted to give positive feedback, which is generally a good thing. He approached the manager to commend the waitress, which is a common way to show appreciation. The waitress even seemed happy, and the manager thanked him. So from the restaurant's perspective, he did something positive.\n\nNow, the date was upset. Why? The author's main goal was to have a good time with her, and he wanted to acknowledge the good service. But she might have felt that he was trying to impress her by doing something grand. The author mentions that he was getting close to asking her to be his girlfriend, so maybe he thought a compliment to the staff would be a nice gesture. However, she interpreted it as the author being full of himself, thinking he was doing something to impress her. That's a communication issue between them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, complimenting someone's work is not inherently wrong. The manager and waitress appreciated it. The date's reaction might be due to personal feelings or misinterpretation. Unless the author's actions were inappropriate, like giving a fake compliment or doing something beyond just praising the service, he's not in the wrong. The key here is that the author did something good, and the date was unhappy for her own reasons. So the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
