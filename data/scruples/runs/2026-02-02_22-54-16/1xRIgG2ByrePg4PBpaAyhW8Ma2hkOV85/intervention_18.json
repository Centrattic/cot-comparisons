I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by telling the manager his waitress did a great job. The main conflict is between the author and his date, who was upset about this action.\n\nFirst, complimenting the waitress is generally a positive action. The author noticed good service and wanted to acknowledge it, which is a kind thing to do. The waitress even appreciated it, so that's a good sign. The spill incident was handled well, and the author still decided to commend her, which shows recognition of her effort despite a minor mistake.\n\nNow, the date's reaction is key here. She felt that this action was meant to impress her and didn't work. Maybe she thought the author was trying too hard to show off or maybe she's uncomfortable with such gestures. However, the author's intention was genuine\u2014praising someone for good service isn't inherently wrong. The date's reaction might be more about her personal feelings or expectations rather than the action itself.\n\nThe author didn't do anything unethical or harmful. Complimenting a service worker is encouraged and can boost their morale. The conflict arises from the date's interpretation of the gesture, which is subjective. The author apologized after realizing it upset her, showing accountability.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the action was positive and the issue stems from the date's perspective, not the author's wrongdoing.\n"
