I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling the manager their waitress did a great job, which led to their date being upset. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe main action here is the author complimenting the waitress by going to the manager. The date didn't like that and called the author an asshole. The question is whether the author's action was wrong.\n\nFrom the story, the author was on a date, and the waitress provided excellent service, even handling a spill politely. The author wanted to commend her through the manager, which is a common way to give positive feedback. The waitress was happy, and the manager appreciated the feedback. So on the surface, the author's action seems positive and appropriate.\n\nBut the date was upset. She felt that this action was either self-centered or not the right thing to do during a date. Why would she be upset? Maybe she thought the author was trying to impress her with a grand gesture, which didn't work. Or perhaps she felt that the situation didn't require such a step, maybe she preferred a more private or personal thank you to the waitress without involving the manager. Dates can be about the interaction between the two people, so maybe she found the public commendation unnecessary or awkward.\n\nThe author's intention was to acknowledge good service, which is a good thing, but the context of a date might have different expectations. The date's reaction suggests that she felt the action was not appropriate in their specific situation. However, the author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's service. Complimenting service staff is not inherently wrong.\n\nBut the crux here is the date's perspective. The author's action might have been misinterpreted as trying to show off or take attention away from her. However, the author's intention was genuine praise, not self-aggrandizement. The waitress appreciated it, so the action had a positive impact. The date's dissatisfaction stems from her personal feelings about how the date was handled, not the author's action being objectively wrong.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's action was appropriate and positive. The date's reaction is about their personal feelings rather than the action being objectively wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
