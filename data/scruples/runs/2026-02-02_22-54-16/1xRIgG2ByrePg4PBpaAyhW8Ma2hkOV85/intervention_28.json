I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that the author wanted to acknowledge the waitress's good service, including handling a spill gracefully. The date didn't appreciate it and got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to give the waitress a compliment. Complimenting service staff is usually a good thing. But the date took it the wrong way. Why would she react that way? Maybe she felt the author was trying to show off or wasn't paying attention to her. Maybe the date expected the author to focus on her instead of the waitress, even though the waitress did a good job. \n\nThe author's actions themselves don't seem problematic. Telling a manager about good service is a common way to commend someone. However, the date's reaction is subjective. The question is whether the author did something wrong. Since the action was positive and not harmful, the author might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's a social expectation that the date felt was breached. But generally, complimenting someone else isn't a social faux pas unless done in a competitive or demeaning way. The author did it in a genuine way. \n\nThe waitress was appreciative, so the action was valid. The date's response might be an issue of personal feelings rather than the author's wrongdoing. The author apologized, which shows they tried to make amends. So, the answer might be B (No) the author is not in the wrong.\n"
