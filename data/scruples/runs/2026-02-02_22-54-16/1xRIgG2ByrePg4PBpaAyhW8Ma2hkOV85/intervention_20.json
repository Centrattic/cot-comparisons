I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress's manager about her service, leading to his date being upset. I need to figure out if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went on a date, the waitress provided good service, even after a minor spill. The author wanted to commend her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave a positive review. The date didn't like this and accused him of trying to impress her, which backfired.\n\nHmm. The key here is the date's reaction. Why would she be upset? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to show off or that he didn't trust her to handle the situation himself. But the author's intention was to praise the waitress, which is a positive action. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager thanked him. So the action itself wasn't wrong.\n\nHowever, the date's discomfort could be due to personal reasons. Maybe she felt that the author was being overly involved in the server's job, or perhaps she thought it was unnecessary. But the author didn't have any malicious intent. He was just being polite and acknowledging good service. \n\nIn such cases, unless there's a specific reason the date would be upset (like the author trying to get a discount or something), the act of giving a positive review is usually seen as a good thing. The problem here seems to stem from the date's personal reaction, not the author's action. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
