I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress to her manager, which led to his date being upset. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author and his date went out to dinner. The waitress provided good service, even after a minor spill. The author wanted to compliment her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave the waitress a positive review. His date took offense and called him an asshole. Now he's asking if he was wrong.\n\nThe main points here are about the appropriateness of the author's action. Complimenting service staff is generally a positive thing. It's common for customers to praise good service, even to managers. The waitress was appreciative, and the manager thanked the author. So the action itself seems positive. \n\nBut why was the date upset? The date might have felt that the author was trying to show off or be self-centered by going through the extra step of talking to the manager. She might have preferred a more direct compliment to the waitress instead of involving the manager. Or maybe she found the action unnecessary or thought it was a form of bragging. The author mentions he was trying to impress her, which backfired. \n\nHowever, there's no indication that the author did anything inappropriate or that the waitress was upset. The waitress was happy with the feedback. The problem seems to be between the author and his date's differing expectations or perceptions. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job or the restaurant's policies. He followed a normal procedure for giving feedback. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for complimenting the waitress. The issue is more about the date's reaction and their interpersonal dynamics. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key is that praising good service is acceptable, and the problem stems from the date's interpretation, not the author's action itself.\n"
