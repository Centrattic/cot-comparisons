I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which led to the date ending poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their date went to a burger place, and the waitress provided excellent service. She even handled a minor spill well. The author wanted to commend her, so they asked to speak to the manager and gave the positive feedback. The date didn't like this and accused the author of being full of himself. Now the user is confused why this would be a problem.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's action was to praise the waitress, not criticize. The date felt unimpressed or maybe even offended. But why? Let me think about possible angles. Complimenting a waitress to her manager is usually a good thing. It shows appreciation and acknowledges good service. But maybe the date felt like the author was trying to one-up her or show off? Like, instead of just saying thanks, he went through the manager. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, could there be a cultural or personal sensitivity here? For example, maybe the date felt that the author was being overly formal or not genuine in his approach. Or perhaps she thought he was trying to be too nice to the waitress in her presence, making her feel left out or something. \n\nWait, the author mentions that he was planning to ask her to be his girlfriend. Maybe the date felt that by complimenting the waitress in front of her (even after the fact), he was making a mistake that overshadowed the potential proposal. But the compliment was given to the manager, not directly to the waitress in her presence. Unless the date felt that the method of complimenting via the manager was somehow inappropriate. Sometimes people might prefer direct feedback to the employee rather than going through management, but that's more about the method than the intent. The waitress herself was happy, which is a positive outcome. \n\nAnother angle: the date might have felt that the author was trying too hard to be a good customer, maybe as a sign of his character, but she misinterpreted it as him trying to be impressive or grandiose. The phrase \"full of myself\" suggests she thought he was showing off. So the author's intention was good, but the date took it the wrong way. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if his intent was to express gratitude, then no. But if he did it in a way that was meant to look better than himself in front of the date, then maybe. But the question is whether the action itself is wrong. The waitress received a compliment, the manager appreciated the feedback, and there's no indication of any harm done. The date's reaction seems to be based on her own feelings, perhaps insecurity or a different expectation of how to handle compliments. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong for complimenting the waitress. The issue was the date's reaction, not the act of giving the compliment. The author even apologized and reached out afterward, which is a good sign. Unless there's a hidden context, like the waitress was a friend of the date or something, but that's not mentioned here. Therefore, the author's action was appropriate and well-intentioned.\n"
