I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author went on a third date with a girl, and they were at a burger place. The waitress had good service, was friendly, and even after spilling water (which wasn't her fault because she was bumped), she apologized and cleaned it up. The author wanted to compliment her, so when the check came, he asked to speak to the manager. The waitress thought something was wrong, but the author just said the service was excellent and mentioned her name. The manager and waitress were happy, but the date was upset. She thought the author was trying to impress her by complimenting the waitress and called him an asshole. Now the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the waitress did a good job, maybe the author wanted to show off by praising her staff, and the date took offense. The author's intention was to give positive feedback, which is usually a good thing. But the date felt it was a way to impress her, implying the author was being self-centered. The waitress was appreciative, so the action itself was positive. But maybe the method of doing it in front of the date made her uncomfortable. \n\nWait, the author told the manager that the waitress did a great job, which is a compliment. The waitress was happy. The manager appreciated the feedback. So the action was good in terms of acknowledging good service. But the date felt that the author was trying to \"impress\" her by doing this, which could be a red flag for her. Maybe she felt that the author was more focused on showing off than genuinely appreciating the service. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the action was positive, but the context was a date. If the author wanted to compliment the waitress, maybe he should have done it privately, like leaving a note or a tip with a message. But he went through the manager, which is a standard way to give feedback. However, doing it in front of the date might have made it seem like a performance. \n\nThe waitress's reaction was positive, so the author did the right thing towards her. The issue is with the date. The author might not have realized that his actions were perceived as trying to gain favor with the date by complimenting a waitress, especially if the date felt it was insincere or that he was trying too hard. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? He didn't intend to make the date feel uncomfortable. The date's reaction was unexpected. The author's action itself wasn't wrong, but maybe the timing or the way he did it was inappropriate for a date. However, complimenting good service is common. Maybe the date was just sensitive to it. \n\nAlternatively, the waitress's job is to serve, so complimenting her is a positive thing. The author might have been sincere in wanting to give her recognition, but the date took it the wrong way. It's possible the date felt that the author was trying to appear generous or kind in her presence, which could be seen as trying to impress her. But the author's intent was genuine. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He did a good thing for the waitress. The date's reaction is more about her perception than the author's actual action. Unless the author had some ulterior motive, which he didn't. So the answer might be B, No. But some might argue that it's not the best way to handle it on a date. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action was positive and he didn't harm anyone, maybe he's not at fault.\n"
