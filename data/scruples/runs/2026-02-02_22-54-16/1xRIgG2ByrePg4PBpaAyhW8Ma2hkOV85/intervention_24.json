I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about the service, and the date was upset about it. The author thought he wasn't wrong, but the date called him an asshole.\n\nHmm. The situation is that the author wanted to compliment the waitress, so he went to the manager. The waitress did a good job, even after a minor spill that wasn't her fault. The author's date didn't like that he did this. The author is wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Complimenting someone's job performance is usually a good thing. The waitress did well, and the author wanted to let the manager know. The manager and waitress appreciated it. So the action itself seems positive.\n\nBut the date was upset. Why? Maybe she found it unnecessary or thought it was self-serving. The author mentions he was getting close to asking her to be his girlfriend, so maybe she felt this gesture was more about showing off than genuine. Or perhaps she didn't want to be seen as a date where the guy takes credit for complimenting service, which could be awkward for her.\n\nBut the author's intent was to commend the waitress. There's no indication he did it to impress the date in a negative way. The date's reaction is a bit confusing. Maybe she's uncomfortable with public praise or felt it was inappropriate in a dating context. But the author didn't do anything wrong in the waitress's eyes. He followed the correct procedure for a compliment, which is to tell the manager.\n\nIs there a social norm that says you shouldn't compliment the server in front of your date? Not that I know of. Usually, people appreciate when you acknowledge good service. However, if the date felt it was a move to make himself look better (like trying to be a good tipper or showing generosity), but the author didn't mention tipping. He just wanted to give feedback.\n\nThe author's actions were appropriate. The date's reaction is more of a personal issue. The author isn't in the wrong here. The problem is with the date's perception, not the author's action. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
