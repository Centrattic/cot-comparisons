I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for complimenting the waitress in front of their date. The situation involves a third date where they went to a burger place. The waitress provided good service, even after a minor spill. The author wanted to commend her, so they asked to speak to the manager and praised the waitress. The date didn't like it and called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, the act of complimenting the waitress seems positive. Praising good service is a common and appreciated gesture, especially in service industries. The author even notes the waitress handled a spill well, so the compliment was justified. The manager and waitress were happy with the feedback, which suggests it was a valid action.\n\nNow, the date's reaction is crucial. She felt that this action was an attempt to impress her and came off as self-centered. But why would complimenting someone else's service be a problem? Maybe she expected the author to focus more on her or felt that the gesture was unnecessary. However, there's no rule that dates can't have interactions with staff. Complimenting service is a normal part of dining out and doesn't inherently disrespect the date.\n\nThe date's response seems a bit harsh. If the author had done something like showing off or being rude, that would be different. But here, it's a positive action. The author even apologized later, which shows they care about her feelings. The fact that the waitress was happy and the manager appreciated the feedback adds to the author's side.\n\nIs there a cultural or social norm that the author violated? Generally, people are encouraged to give positive feedback to service staff. It's a way to support them and acknowledge their work. Unless the date had a specific reason to be upset (like jealousy, which isn't mentioned), the author's action seems reasonable.\n\nThe date might have felt slighted if she thought the author was trying to use the compliment to impress her, but that's a bit of a stretch. The author's intention was to recognize good service, not to show off. The date's reaction could stem from insecurity or a misinterpretation of the gesture. However, the author didn't force the compliment; they did it through the proper channel (manager), which is standard procedure.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted appropriately by giving a deserved compliment. The date's negative reaction seems unwarranted in this context. The answer is B.\n"
