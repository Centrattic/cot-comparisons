I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The story is about a guy who compliments his waitress's manager about her great service, but his date took it negatively. The key points here are the actions of the author and the reaction of his date.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to praise the waitress for excellent service. Even though there was a small spill, he acknowledged it wasn't her fault and she handled it well. He went to the manager to give positive feedback, which is a common and respectful way to commend someone's work. The waitress was happy, the manager appreciated the feedback. So from the restaurant's perspective, the author did the right thing.\n\nThe issue came from the date. She felt that bringing up the manager was unnecessary or maybe she thought he was showing off. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of his actions towards the waitress or the manager. He's just giving a compliment. The conflict arises from the date's reaction, not the author's action itself. The author apologized and tried to make things right by texting her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything inappropriate. His intention was positive. The problem is more about the date's expectations or feelings. Maybe she felt it was a public display of his approval for the waitress, but that's speculative. The author's actions are justified, so the answer should be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
