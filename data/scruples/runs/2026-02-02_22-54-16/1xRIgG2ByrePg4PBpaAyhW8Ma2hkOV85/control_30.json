I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling the manager their waitress did a great job. The situation is that they were on a date, and the author wanted to compliment the waitress, but their date didn't appreciate it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was on a third date with a girl they really liked. They wanted to treat her to dinner and had good intentions. The waitress provided excellent service, even when she accidentally spilled water but handled it well. The author decided to talk to the manager to commend the waitress. The date, however, reacted negatively, feeling that the author was trying to impress her by complimenting a staff member instead of focusing on their date.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, the action of praising the waitress was positive. It's a commendable thing to do, and the author did it in a respectful way by going through the manager. However, the issue might be the context of it being a date. If the date expected the author to focus solely on their interaction and the compliment to the waitress made her feel overlooked or like the author was trying to show off, then maybe the timing or the action was off. But was it wrong?\n\nThe key points here are about intentions and social norms. Complimenting service staff is generally a good deed. However, on a date, if the other person feels that their partner is directing attention away from them, that could be a point of conflict. But the author's intention was to acknowledge good service, not to impress the date. The date's reaction was negative, interpreting it as the author trying to impress her, which might not be the case. \n\nSo, the author isn't inherently in the wrong for giving a compliment. The waitress deserved it, and the manager appreciated the feedback. The date's reaction is more about her own feelings or expectations rather than the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The problem might lie in the date's interpretation rather than the author's action itself.\n"
