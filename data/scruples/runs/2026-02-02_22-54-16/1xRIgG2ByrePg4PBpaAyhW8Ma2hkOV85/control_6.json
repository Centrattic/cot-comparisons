I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by praising the waitress to her manager, and the girlfriend was upset about it. The author is confused why that would be a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his date went to dinner, the service was good, and the author wanted to compliment the waitress. He approached the manager to give positive feedback. The girlfriend didn't like that and was upset, thinking he was trying to impress her but failed.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about possible angles. Complimenting someone's work is usually a good thing. But maybe the girlfriend felt it was unnecessary or that he was showing off? The author says he just wanted to acknowledge good service. The waitress appreciated it, the manager thanked him. So on the surface, he did a good thing. But the girlfriend didn't like it. Why?\n\nPerhaps she felt he was trying to impress her by being nice to the waitress, but it backfired. Or maybe she thought it was an awkward way to show appreciation. Maybe she was more interested in the romance aspect of the date and didn't want the attention on the waitress. The author's intention was positive, but maybe the execution or the context made it uncomfortable for her.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, he didn't do anything wrong. The waitress did a good job, he gave feedback, which is a common practice. The problem is that his date didn't appreciate it. The question is whether his action was wrong, not necessarily why the date was upset. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, complimenting service staff is generally a positive action. Unless there was some hidden context where it was inappropriate, like if the waitress was not supposed to be complimented, but that's not the case here. The spill was minor and handled well, so the author was just being kind. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about their relationship dynamics than the action itself. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
