I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which upset their date. \n\nFirst, the main action here is the author going out of their way to praise the waitress. They mention that the waitress did a great job, even after a minor spill. The manager and waitress were happy with the feedback. The author's intention was to commend the waitress, which is a positive action. \n\nThe conflict arises because the date was upset by this gesture. The date felt that the author was trying to impress them with the compliment, which didn't work, and called them self-absorbed. The key here is understanding the perspective of both parties. \n\nFrom the author's side, they wanted to acknowledge good service, which is a common and polite thing to do. They didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job or the restaurant's policies. The compliment was genuine and appreciated by the waitress and manager.\n\nOn the other hand, the date might have felt that the gesture was unnecessary or even boastful. Maybe she was expecting a more private or personal moment, and the public compliment made her uncomfortable. Alternatively, she could have misinterpreted the author's intention, thinking he was trying to show off instead of just being kind.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action itself (praising the waitress) was appropriate and the issue is more about the date's personal reaction, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The problem lies more with the date's interpretation rather than the author's action. \n\nHowever, relationships involve communication and understanding each other's preferences. If the author had known beforehand that the date would be uncomfortable with public compliments, they might have acted differently. But since that wasn't the case, the author did something positive, and the date's reaction is her own issue. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The situation is more about the date's personal feelings rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
