I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author praised their waitress to her manager, but their date got upset and called them an asshole. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to commend the waitress for good service. The waitress handled a spill professionally, and the author took the time to give her a compliment to her manager. That seems like a kind and appropriate action. The date, however, was unimpressed and even upset, thinking the author was showing off or being self-centered.\n\nNow, the key points here are the intentions and the reactions. The author's action was meant to be a compliment, which is usually a good thing. But the date's reaction suggests that she might have felt this was unnecessary or perhaps even arrogant. However, there's no indication that the author's action actually harmed the waitress or the restaurant. The waitress was happy with the compliment, and the manager appreciated the feedback.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. Since the action was a positive one aimed at giving credit where it's due, it's hard to fault the author. The date's disapproval might be more about her own expectations or how she perceived the situation, not the action itself. The author did nothing wrong by praising good service. The problem seems to be a mismatch in expectations between the author and their date, not the act of complimenting the waitress.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
