I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he went on a third date with a girl and wanted to compliment their waitress by telling her manager. He actually went through the proper channel to give positive feedback, which is something that's usually encouraged. The waitress did a good job, even after a minor spill that wasn't her fault. The manager appreciated the feedback, and the waitress was happy.\n\nBut his date was upset. She thought he was trying to impress her by showing off or maybe being self-centered. The key here is her reaction. She called him an asshole, albeit not exactly with those words. So why would she be upset? Maybe she felt that he was trying to use the compliment as a way to look good in front of her, or perhaps she didn't like that he took the time to do that during their date. Maybe she thought it was unnecessary or that it made the waitress uncomfortable. Or maybe she was just having a bad night and took it personally.\n\nBut the author's intention was to commend the waitress's excellent service. He followed the correct procedure by going to the manager, which is the standard way to give feedback. Compliments are generally positive, and in many places, they are encouraged. There's no indication that he did anything inappropriate or that the waitress didn't appreciate it. The waitress even thanked him, so it seems like it was a genuine positive interaction.\n\nThe problem here is more about the date's perception. The author might not have considered that his gesture could be misinterpreted. However, the action itself\u2014giving a compliment through proper channels\u2014doesn't seem wrong. Maybe the date felt that the gesture was insincere or that he was trying to show off. But the author's intent was to praise the waitress, not to impress her. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action was appropriate and the problem lies in the date's perception, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the date's reaction is valid because the gesture was inconsiderate or awkward in the context of their date, then maybe there's something to her criticism. But given that the waitress appreciated it and the author's intention was positive, it's more likely that the issue was the date's misunderstanding. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
