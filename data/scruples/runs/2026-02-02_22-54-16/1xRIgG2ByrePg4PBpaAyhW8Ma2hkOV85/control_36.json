I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress in front of his date. The key points here are the context of their relationship, the action taken, and the date's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author and his date had been on three dates, and he was close to asking her out. The waitress provided good service, even handling a minor spill gracefully. The author wanted to commend her, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave the waitress a positive review. His date reacted negatively, feeling it was a pretentious move.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The possible angles here are social norms, intentions, and the impact on the relationship. On one hand, praising a server is a common and positive gesture. It's a way to acknowledge good service and support the employee. On the other hand, the date perceived it as self-congratulatory, maybe thinking the author was trying to impress her through his actions, which could come off as insincere or boastful.\n\nHowever, the author's intention seems genuine. He wanted to recognize the waitress's good work, not to impress his date. His date's reaction might stem from personal insecurities or misinterpretations. The fact that the waitress appreciated the feedback supports the idea that the author's action was appropriate.\n\nThe key here is intent. If the author's action was sincere and not an attempt to show off, then it's not his fault. The date's dissatisfaction is more about her own perspective than his action. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no hidden social faux pas here. Sometimes, in dating contexts, certain gestures can be misinterpreted. However, giving a compliment to a service staff is generally a good deed. The manager and waitress were happy, so the action was correct. The date's reaction is her issue, not the author's wrongdoing.\n"
