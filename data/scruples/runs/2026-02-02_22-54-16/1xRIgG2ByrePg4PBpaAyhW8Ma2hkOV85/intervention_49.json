I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The situation is that the author and his date went to a burger place, had good service, and the author wanted to commend the waitress. But his date got upset and called him an asshole.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the author's intent versus the date's reaction. The author wanted to praise the waitress, which is a positive action. The date, however, might have felt that the author was trying to impress her by doing something grand, like complimenting the staff, which she didn't appreciate. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's service; he was just being polite and recognizing good service. \n\nBut why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that the author was being self-centered, like trying to show off his good manners or trying to make her feel something. Or perhaps she was unimpressed because she expected a different kind of gesture. The author said he was getting close to asking her out, so maybe she thought he was trying to use the compliment as a move to impress her instead of focusing on their date. \n\nHowever, from the author's perspective, he was just being appreciative. Complimenting good service is a common and socially positive thing to do. The manager and waitress appreciated it, so the action itself was good. The date's reaction seems more about her personal feelings rather than the action being wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He did something right and got a negative reaction from his date, but that doesn't make his action wrong. The issue might be in their communication or differing expectations rather than the act itself. So the answer should be B.\n"
