I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl they met online, and they had a good time. The waitress was doing a great job, even though there was a minor spill that wasn't her fault. After dinner, the author wanted to speak to the manager to commend the waitress. The date got upset and called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to praise the waitress. The waitress even seemed happy with the feedback. But the date didn't like it. Why would she react that way? Maybe she felt the author was trying to show off or not focused on her. The author was trying to be a good customer and appreciate service, which is a common and respectful thing to do. However, in the context of a date, maybe the girl felt like the author was more interested in the waitress or trying to impress someone else. But that seems a bit strange because the author was complimenting the waitress, not flirting. Alternatively, maybe she felt the author was overstepping by mentioning her to the manager, but that's unlikely since it was a positive comment.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent versus the date's interpretation. The author did nothing wrong in terms of the waitress's service; it was a genuine compliment. The date's reaction seems based on her own feelings or misinterpretation. The author apologized and wanted to continue the relationship. Since the action itself was appropriate and respectful, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about the date's personal reaction rather than the author's actions.\n"
