I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, and the date was upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author went out of their way to commend the waitress. That seems like a positive action. The waitress did a good job, and the author recognized it. Usually, giving compliments is a good thing. But the date was upset. Why?\n\nThe date might have felt that the author was trying to impress her by showing off their ability to praise someone. Maybe she was expecting a more direct compliment to her, or she felt it was unnecessary. Alternatively, she might have thought the author was trying to be overly helpful in a situation that didn't require it. \n\nBut the author's action was genuine. The waitress deserved the compliment. The author didn't do anything wrong by giving her manager a positive review. The date's reaction seems like a personal issue, possibly projecting her own expectations onto the situation. \n\nThe author also took time to apologize, which shows they cared about her feelings. The waitress appreciated the compliment, so the author's action had a positive impact. The problem here is more about the date's sensitivity than the author's actions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is with the date's reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
