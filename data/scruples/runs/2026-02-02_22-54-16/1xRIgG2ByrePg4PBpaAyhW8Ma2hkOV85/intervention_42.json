I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author went on a date with a girl and their waitress provided good service. The author wanted to compliment the waitress by talking to her manager. The date didn't like this and called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to recognize good service. Complimenting a waitress through the manager isn't typical, but it's not necessarily wrong. People do leave positive feedback for good service. However, the context here is a date. The date might have felt that the compliment was unnecessary or even a form of showing off, which could be awkward in a romantic setting.\n\nThe key points to consider: Was the action inappropriate in the context of a date? Maybe the date felt overshadowed or that the attention was misplaced. The waitress did a good job, so the author's intent wasn't to criticize but to praise. However, the way it was done\u2014talking to the manager in front of the waitress\u2014might have been unexpected. Maybe the date thought the author was trying to impress her by being a \"good customer,\" but that's speculative.\n\nThe waitress appreciated the compliment, as did the manager. The problem seems to be solely with the date's reaction. The author's actions don't directly harm the waitress; they were a positive gesture. The date's reaction is more about their own feelings during the date rather than the author's right to compliment someone else. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The action itself isn't unethical or rude. The date's response is subjective. The author might have misread the situation in terms of the date's expectations, but that doesn't make the action wrong. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
