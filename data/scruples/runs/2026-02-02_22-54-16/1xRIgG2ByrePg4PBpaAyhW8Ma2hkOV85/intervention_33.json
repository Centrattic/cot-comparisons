I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the manager their waitress did a great job. The situation is that the author, on a date, wanted to compliment the waitress's service. The date didn't appreciate it, called them an asshole, and now the author is seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, the action in question is the author seeking out the manager to praise the waitress. The author had a positive experience and wanted to commend the waitress. The waitress did spill water but handled it well. The author points out that the spill wasn't her fault and she apologized quickly.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's a genuine compliment. Complimenting service staff is a common way to show appreciation. It's a positive action, so why would it be wrong? The date, however, was unimpressed. She felt it was self-serving or trying to impress her. But the author's intention was to acknowledge good service, not to one-up or show off.\n\nThe date's reaction is key here. She might have felt that the author was trying to use the compliment as a way to appear generous or to gain her approval. However, the author's motivation was clear: they wanted to give a compliment. The waitress was happy with the feedback, so the action had a positive effect on her.\n\nIs there any cultural or social norm that makes complimenting a server in front of a date inappropriate? Maybe if the date felt it was unnecessary or if there was a prior issue with the author trying to impress. But in this case, the author's actions were appropriate. The date's reaction is subjective. The author isn't in the wrong because they did something good. The problem seems to be on the date's side, not the author's.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
