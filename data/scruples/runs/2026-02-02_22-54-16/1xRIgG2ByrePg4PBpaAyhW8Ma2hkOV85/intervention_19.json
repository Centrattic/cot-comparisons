I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The story is about a guy who told the manager that the waitress did a great job, and his date was upset about it. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the guy met a girl online, they had a few dates, and this was the third one. They went to a burger place, and the waitress was good\u2014enthusiastic, friendly, handled a spill gracefully. At the end, he wanted to speak to the manager to compliment the waitress. The manager and waitress were happy, but his date was upset, called him an asshole, and now they're not talking. The guy is confused because he thought it was a nice gesture.\n\nSo the key points here: the guy's action was to give positive feedback to the waitress's manager. His date took it as self-serving or arrogant. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, complimenting a service worker is generally a good thing. It's a way to acknowledge good service and can boost a person's morale. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager was grateful. So from the waitress's perspective, the guy did something positive.\n\nOn the other hand, his date might have felt that he was trying to impress her by showing off his ability to give compliments, maybe as a way to appear generous. But the date's reaction suggests she didn't see it that way. She might have thought he was trying to manipulate the situation, or that he was overstepping, or even that he was self-centered for focusing on the waitress during their date. The guy's intention was to do a good deed, but the date perceived it as a negative action.\n\nThe guy's mistake, if any, could be not considering his date's perspective. If the date expected the compliment to be directed at her or to focus on their time together, then complimenting the waitress might have seemed like he didn't value their time as much. Alternatively, she might have felt that he was trying too hard to be nice, which could come off as insincere or boastful.\n\nHowever, the waitress did a good job, and giving her a compliment is a natural response. It's possible the date was just having a bad night or had other issues. But the guy's action, while well-intentioned, might have clashed with the date's expectations. \n\nIs the guy wrong? It's debatable. He did something kind, but maybe he should have considered his date's feelings more. However, he didn't do anything malicious. The date's reaction is more about her own feelings than his actions being inherently wrong. So in terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong because his intention was good, but he could have handled it differently. \n\nBut according to the user's options, it's a yes or no. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No), because the action was positive, even if the date had a negative reaction. It's not the author's fault she took it the wrong way unless there was a specific context they were unaware of.\n"
