I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to the manager. The situation is that they went out on a date, had good service, the waitress spilled water but was quick to apologize and fix it. The author wanted to commend her to the manager. The date didn't like it, called him an asshole, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the possible perspectives. The author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to acknowledge good service. Complimenting someone's work to their manager is a common way to appreciate them. But maybe the date felt that he was trying to show off or be overly direct. \n\nWait, the waitress brought the check, and the author asked to speak to the manager. The waitress might have thought there was a problem. When the author gave the compliment, the manager thanked him. The waitress was happy. But the date was upset. Why? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to impress her by taking the time to praise the waitress, but it came across as self-centered or unnecessary. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? The act of complimenting the waitress to the manager seems like a good gesture. It's a way to provide positive feedback, which is encouraged. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager did too. The issue seems to be the date's reaction. \n\nBut perhaps the date expected more direct interaction with the waitress or thought the author was overstepping by giving the compliment in front of the manager. However, giving a compliment to a manager is standard practice. The author didn't do anything unethical or harmful. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the date felt that the author was trying to be overly polite or trying to impress her by showing off, but the author's intention was genuine. The waitress's positive reaction supports the author's action. The date's negative response is their own issue, but the author isn't wrong for doing something kind. \n\nSo, the author's action was appropriate. The date's reaction is their own opinion, but the act of giving a compliment isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
