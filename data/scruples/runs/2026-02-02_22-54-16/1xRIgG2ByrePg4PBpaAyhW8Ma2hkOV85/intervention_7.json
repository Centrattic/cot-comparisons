I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for praising the waitress's manager about her good service, and their date was upset about it. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the situation: They went on a date, the waitress did a good job despite a minor spill, and the author wanted to commend her. They went through the manager to give the compliment. The date got upset, called them an asshole, and now they're seeking opinions.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to acknowledge good service. Complimenting someone via the manager is a common way to recognize good work. The waitress was happy, the manager appreciated it. So why was the date upset?\n\nThe date might have felt that the author was trying to impress her by doing something grandiose. Maybe she didn't appreciate the gesture because she thought it was unnecessary or that he was showing off. Or perhaps she was jealous of the attention the waitress received. It's possible the author misread her reaction, thinking it was about the gesture when it might have been about something else entirely.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had no malicious intent. They were trying to do something kind and positive. The date's reaction seems unwarranted if the author's actions were genuine. But sometimes, in relationships, even well-intentioned actions can cause issues if they're misinterpreted or if there's underlying tension.\n\nI should weigh whether the author's action was objectively wrong. Since they were giving a compliment and the waitress appreciated it, the action itself isn't wrong. The date's negative reaction is her own issue, unless there's more context. The author didn't do anything harmful; they just praised good service. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
