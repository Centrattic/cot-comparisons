I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager she did a great job, and the date was upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author wanted to compliment the waitress by speaking to the manager. The waitress had good service, even after a minor spill. The author's intention was positive, to give a compliment, not to criticize. \n\nThe date got upset and called the author an asshole. The user's stance is that the author isn't wrong, but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nPossible reasons why the date was upset: maybe she felt the author was trying to show off or be grandiose. The author might have done it without considering her feelings, perhaps making the date feel less important. Alternatively, the date might have a low opinion of such gestures or found it unnecessary. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, giving praise to the waitress was a genuine compliment. The spill was handled well, and the manager was thanked. There's no indication of insincerity. \n\nIs there a cultural or social norm that the author violated? Sometimes people do public compliments to show appreciation, which is usually good. However, if the date felt overshadowed, maybe she didn't like the attention given to the waitress. \n\nIn relationships, actions that make one partner feel less appreciated can be a problem. The author might have thought he was doing something nice, but the date might have felt he was prioritizing the waitress's recognition over their date. However, the author's main action was a compliment, not a negative one. \n\nSo, whether it's the author's fault depends on the context of their relationship and the date's expectations. Since the author didn't do anything negative (like a complaint), but the action might have been misinterpreted. \n\nIn most cases, giving a compliment isn't wrong. The woman's reaction might stem from her own feelings or expectations. The author's actions don't cross a line into being inconsiderate or harmful. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
