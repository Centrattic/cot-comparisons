I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for praising a waitress to her manager, which upset their date. The situation is that the couple had a good third date, and the author wanted to commend the waitress for excellent service. The waitress did a great job, even handled a minor spill well. The author went to the manager to give a compliment, but the date took offense, thinking it was an attempt to impress her. The author is confused because he thought the action was positive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The main points are: the waitress deserved the praise, the author approached the manager politely, and there was no negative action\u2014just a compliment. The date's reaction is the only negative outcome here. The question is whether the author is at fault for complimenting the waitress, which caused the date to end poorly.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Was the author's action inappropriate? Did he overstep by giving a compliment to the waitress in front of his date? Maybe the date felt the author was trying to show off or was too focused on others rather than their evening. But the author's intention was genuine praise. However, in a date setting, the date might have felt neglected or that the compliment was unnecessary. But is that the author's fault? He didn't intend to disrespect his date. \n\nAnother angle: Social norms. It's generally good to compliment service staff for good service. The author did it in a proper way by contacting the manager. However, the context is a date, and the date might have felt it was an unnecessary gesture. But the author's action itself is positive. The issue is more about the date's reaction than the author's action. So, unless there's a rule against complimenting others during a date, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nThe waitress's reaction was happy, and the manager appreciated the feedback. The problem arises only with the date's interpretation. The author didn't have malicious intent. The date's frustration might stem from personal insecurities or different priorities. But the author's action was appropriate. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
