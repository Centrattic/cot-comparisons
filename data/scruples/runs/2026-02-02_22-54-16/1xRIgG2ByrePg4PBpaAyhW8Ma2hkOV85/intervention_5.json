I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The situation is that during a date, the author wanted to praise the waitress, so he asked to speak to the manager and gave her positive feedback. The date didn't appreciate it and even called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author's intention was to compliment the waitress, which is a positive action. He went through the proper channel (manager's office) to give feedback, which is the right way to handle such things. The waitress was appreciative, and the manager thanked him. So, the author's actions seem appropriate.\n\nNow, the date's reaction is puzzling. She felt it was a problem. Maybe she thought he was trying to show off or take credit for the compliment. But the author's goal was to acknowledge good service, not to impress the date. He even apologized later, showing he cares about her feelings. \n\nPossible angles to consider: cultural norms, what's acceptable in a date scenario. In some contexts, people might find it odd to give such feedback during a date, but it's still a positive action. The date might have felt embarrassed or that the waitress was being put on the spot. Alternatively, maybe the date thought the author was being arrogant. However, the author's actions were genuinely positive and professional.\n\nIs there any wrong here? The author didn't do anything unethical or wrong by praising someone's job performance. The manager and waitress were happy. The only conflict is with the date, which is subjective. The author's actions aren't the issue; the problem lies in the date's perspective. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
