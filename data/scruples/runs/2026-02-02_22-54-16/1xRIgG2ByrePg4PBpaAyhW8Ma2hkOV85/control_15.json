I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl and after dinner, he told the waitress's manager that she did a great job. The waitress had actually spilled a glass of water, but the author thought she handled it well. The problem is that the date didn't take this action well and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the date was upset. The author's intention was to compliment the waitress, which seems like a positive thing. But maybe the date saw it as the author trying to impress her by taking credit or showing off. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe waitress's manager was happy with the feedback, and the waitress was grateful. So from the restaurant's side, it's a good thing. But the date didn't like it. Why? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to make a show of his own generosity or was being self-centered by bringing attention to himself. Or perhaps she thought the spill was a mistake and didn't want the author to highlight the waitress's work in front of the manager, which might have made the waitress uncomfortable if the spill was a problem.\n\nBut the author's action seems positive. Complimenting someone's job is generally good. The waitress handled the spill well, so the author is recognizing her effort. The date might have had her own issues, maybe she's a bit insecure or didn't like that the author was focused on the waitress even after the spill. Alternatively, maybe the author's method of complimenting the waitress was awkward, like going through the manager instead of directly, but that's a bit nitpicky. \n\nI think the key here is the date's reaction. If the author had a good intention and the action was appropriate, then he's not wrong. However, if the date's reaction was based on personal issues, the author isn't at fault. Maybe the date wanted to be the focus of attention and felt overshadowed by the waitress. But the author's action doesn't seem to directly affect the date in a negative way. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem might be with the date's perspective, not the author's action. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
