I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So the situation is that he went on a date with a girl, and they had dinner. The waitress was really good, even though she spilled water but handled it well. He wanted to compliment the waitress's manager, so he asked for the manager and told him the server did an excellent job. His date got upset and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's intention seems positive. He wanted to acknowledge the waitress's good work. Praising someone for their job is usually a good thing. But the date didn't like it. Why might that be? Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that he was showing off? Or perhaps she was uncomfortable with him giving feedback in that way during a date. \n\nWait, he asked for the manager to compliment the waitress. That's a common practice. People often ask for a manager to leave a compliment. Is there a wrong here? Well, maybe the timing or the way he did it? But the author said he was calm and the waitress and manager appreciated it. The waitress was happy with the compliment. \n\nThe date's reaction is puzzling. Maybe she thought it was a waste of time, or maybe she was annoyed that he was focusing on the waitress. But that seems a bit possessive. Alternatively, maybe she felt it was an attempt to impress her with his generosity, which backfired. \n\nIs there a cultural norm that suggests complimenting a server should be done in a different way? Like leaving a tip instead? But the author didn't mention leaving a tip as well. However, he was trying to give verbal praise, which is still valid. \n\nIf the waitress was happy, then the action was positive. The date's reaction might stem from personal feelings rather than the action itself. If the date was upset because she thought the author was trying to show off, then maybe she had issues with his intentions. But the author didn't have that intent; he just wanted to appreciate the service. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's action was appropriate. Complimenting good service is a good practice. The date's reaction is her own problem, not the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
