I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that they were on a date, had good service, and the author wanted to commend the waitress. The date didn't like it, thinking it was self-centered.\n\nFirst, the author's intention seems genuine. They wanted to recognize good service, which is a positive action. The waitress appreciated the feedback, and the manager was grateful. So on the surface, the action itself isn't negative.\n\nBut the date took offense. Why? The user mentioned that the date thought the author was trying to impress her by doing this. Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that he was trying to show off his generosity or attention to detail. This could lead to a misunderstanding about the author's motives.\n\nIs the author wrong for complimenting the waitress? Probably not. Complimenting someone's work is usually a good thing. However, the context is a date where the partner felt slighted. The issue here might be more about the date's reaction and expectations rather than the author's action itself being wrong.\n\nThe key points are the author's intent versus the date's perception. If the author had no ulterior motive other than expressing gratitude, then he's not in the wrong. The date's reaction is a personal issue, perhaps related to insecurity or different social expectations. The author apologizing and wanting to reconcile shows he's considerate of her feelings, which is a positive step.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because complimenting service staff is a positive action, and there's no evidence the author acted with malice or ulterior motives that caused harm beyond the date's personal feelings.\n"
