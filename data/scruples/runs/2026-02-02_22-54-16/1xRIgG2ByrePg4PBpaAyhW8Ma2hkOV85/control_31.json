I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager. The situation is that the author wanted to treat their date to dinner and the waitress provided good service, even after spilling water. Then the author told the manager they did a great job, which made the date upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the date was upset. The author might have thought it was a nice gesture, but maybe the date felt like the attention was on the waitress instead of them. The date called the author an asshole, possibly because they felt neglected or not appreciated. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, complimenting the waitress is a positive action. The spill wasn't her fault, and the author acknowledged that she handled it well. The problem might be that the author didn't consider the date's perspective. On a date, especially one where the author was planning to ask the girl to be his girlfriend, bringing up the waitress might have made the date feel less important. The date could have felt that the author was being inconsiderate or not focused on them.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to praise the waitress for good service. There's no indication he did it to make the date jealous or to be rude. The waitress herself was happy, and the manager appreciated the feedback. The issue here is more about the context of a date and the expectations of the date, not the action itself. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for the action, but maybe in the context. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action was appropriate and the problem arises from the date's reaction, the answer would be B (No). The author didn't do anything wrong; the date had a different reaction. Unless there's some hidden motive, like trying to flirt with the waitress, but the story doesn't mention that. The author was just giving a compliment. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
