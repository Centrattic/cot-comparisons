I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he told his date's waitress's manager that the waitress did a great job, and the date was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The main points are that the waitress was doing good service, even handling a spillage well. The author wanted to compliment her, so he went to the manager. The date found this annoying and called him an asshole. The author is confused because he thought he was doing a good thing.\n\nSo, the key question is whether complimenting the waitress was wrong. From a common-sense perspective, praising someone's work is usually a good thing. However, the date's reaction suggests she might have felt it was unnecessary or even intrusive. Maybe she was uncomfortable with the attention on the waitress or felt he was showing off. But is that a valid reason to blame the author?\n\nThe user might be considering social norms here. It's generally acceptable to compliment service staff, and sometimes going through a manager is a standard way to give feedback. The date's reaction seems a bit harsh, but perhaps there's more to their relationship dynamics. The author might have misread the situation, but the action itself doesn't seem wrong. \n\nAlso, the waitress was happy and the manager appreciated the feedback. So the author's intent was positive. The issue seems to be between the author and his date's preferences. Unless there was some unspoken rule against complimenting staff in their relationship, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't wrong for giving a compliment.\n"
