I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they praised their waitress's service by talking to the manager, and their date got upset about it. The main question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is on a third date with a woman they really like. They went to a burger place, had a good time, and the waitress provided excellent service, even after a minor spill. The author then asked to speak to the manager to commend the waitress. The date didn't appreciate this and called the author an asshole, leading to the breakup or at least tension.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's action was to give positive feedback to the manager about the waitress. The date was upset by this. The user is asking if the author was wrong here.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. Was the author's action inappropriate in the context of the date? Maybe the date expected a more private or romantic send-off and the public commendation felt inconsiderate or like showing off. \n\n2. Did the author overstep by involving the manager unnecessarily? Even though it was a compliment, sometimes people might feel it's not needed unless there's an issue. However, complimenting staff is generally positive.\n\n3. Communication issues between the couple. The date might have felt the author was more focused on praising the waitress than on the date itself. Maybe the date wanted more attention or perceived the action as trying to impress them in a way that was off-putting.\n\n4. The waitress situation: the spill wasn't the waitress's fault, so the author's feedback was appropriate. The manager and waitress appreciated it, so from their perspective, it was a good thing.\n\nBut the problem is that the date was upset. So even if the action was objectively correct, maybe it was the wrong thing to do in the context of their relationship. The author might not have considered their date's feelings in that moment. If the date was looking for a more personal or intimate experience, the author's action might have been a misstep.\n\nOn the other hand, giving positive feedback is a kind and considerate act towards the waitress. The author didn't do anything negative, just praised someone. If the date was upset because they felt the author was showing off or being self-congratulatory for giving a compliment, that's more about the date's perspective. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was genuine.\n\nBut maybe the author should have considered that their date might not want to be in a situation where the focus shifted to praising another person. Maybe the date felt it was unnecessary or that the author was trying to be the hero. In that case, the author's action was well-intentioned but perhaps inconsiderate of their partner's feelings.\n\nSo the answer hinges on whether the action was objectively wrong or if it's a matter of differing expectations. Since the author didn't do anything harmful or unethical, but the date was upset for personal reasons, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's a case to be made that they didn't consider their partner's feelings, which could be seen as a misstep in their relationship.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often looks at whether the person did something that's objectively wrong or if it's a difference in opinion. Since the author's action was positive (praising a service worker), but the date was upset, it's a situation where the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they could have done better. Since there's no malicious intent or harmful action, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
