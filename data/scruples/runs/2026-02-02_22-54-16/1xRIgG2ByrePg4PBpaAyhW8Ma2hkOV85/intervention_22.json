I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The author's date was upset and called him an asshole. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his date went out to dinner, and the waitress provided good service. There was a minor spill that wasn't her fault, and she handled it well. The author wanted to praise her, so he told the manager. The date was upset, thinking the author was trying to impress her, and the author felt it backfired.\n\nThe key points here are: The author's intention was to compliment the waitress, which is generally a positive action. He went through the proper channel by speaking to the manager. The date's reaction is confusing because the author's action was meant to be a compliment. Maybe the date felt that the author was trying to show off or that it was unnecessary. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, he was recognizing good service. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager thanked him. The problem seems to be the date's misunderstanding or her own expectations. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress or the manager. His actions were appropriate.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The issue here is the date's reaction, not the author's action of giving a compliment. The author had no malicious intent, and his action was a kind gesture. The date's response is more about her feelings towards the situation rather than the author's mistake.\n"
