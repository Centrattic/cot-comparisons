I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went on a date with a girl, had good service from a waitress, and then told the manager that the waitress did a great job. The girl was upset and called him an asshole for it. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the girl would be upset. The author's action seems positive\u2014praising the waitress. But maybe there's some context I'm missing. The waitress had spilled water but handled it well. The author thought it was a good job. The girl might have felt that bringing up the spill with the manager was unnecessary or even a bit of a formality. Or maybe she thought that the author was trying to show off by complimenting the waitress in front of her, making her feel less appreciated or overlooked. \n\nWait, he told the manager that the waitress did a great job. But he didn't mention the spill. The waitress had already apologized and cleaned it up. So the author is focusing on the positive aspects despite the minor mistake. That seems reasonable. However, the girl's reaction is the key here. Maybe she felt that the compliment was insincere or that he was trying to impress her by showing how much he pays attention to service, which might not be the right approach. She might not want him to involve the manager unless there's a problem. Or perhaps she thought that the gesture was a bit too formal for a casual date setting, making the situation awkward. \n\nThe author's intention was to commend the waitress for good service, which is a common and appreciable action. The girl, however, interpreted it as the author trying to impress her by being self-serving or maybe even trying to one-up her. But the author didn't give himself a compliment; he praised the waitress. So maybe the girl felt that the author was trying to use the waitress's good service to reflect well on himself, which might be a projection on her part. \n\nThe fact that the waitress apologized and handled the spill well, and the author still chose to compliment her, is actually a good thing. It shows that he's considerate of the staff's efforts. However, the girl's reaction is that it was supposed to impress her but didn't. Maybe she thought that complimenting the waitress was a way to show off, but the author's intent was genuine. \n\nIn relationships, especially when trying to move forward, actions that one person sees as positive can be misinterpreted by another. The author's actions aren't inherently wrong, but the girl's perspective is valid as well. He might not be in the wrong for giving a compliment, but perhaps he didn't consider how it might make her feel. However, since the author was just being sincere and not trying to undermine her, it's more likely that the girl had her own insecurities or misinterpretations. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He did something positive, and the girl's reaction is her own issue, even though he might need to address it to understand her feelings better.\n"
