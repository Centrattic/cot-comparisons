I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her excellent service. The situation is that they were on a date, the waitress did a good job, and the author wanted to let the manager know. But the date took offense and called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author had a good experience with the waitress, even when there was a minor spill that she handled well. The author then asked to speak to the manager to give positive feedback. This is a common and polite thing to do in many cultures. However, the date was upset by this action. \n\nThe key points here are the intentions of the author. The author's main goal was to commend the waitress, not to impress the date. But the date might have felt that the author was trying to show off or was overly focused on giving compliments instead of focusing on the date. It's possible that the date expected the author to handle the situation differently, like just telling the waitress directly instead of involving the manager. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the action was well-intentioned and appropriate, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the action was inappropriate or considered rude in the context of the date, maybe the author could have handled it differently. But from the description, the author's action seems positive. \n\nThe waitress appreciated the compliment, and the manager is there to receive feedback. The spill was handled well, and the author acknowledged that. The date's reaction might be more about personal preferences or misunderstandings rather than the author's action being objectively wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The date's reaction is subjective, and the author's action was a kind gesture towards the waitress. There's no indication that the author did anything offensive; in fact, the opposite is true. The conflict might stem from the date's expectations rather than the author's actions.\n"
