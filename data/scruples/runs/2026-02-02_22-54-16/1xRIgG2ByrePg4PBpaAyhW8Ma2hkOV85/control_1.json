I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went out on a date with a girl, and at the end of the meal, he told the manager that the waitress did a great job. His date was upset about that and called him an asshole. Now he's asking if he was at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He was on a date, trying to impress the girl, but instead of giving her a compliment, he complimented the waitress. From her reaction, it seems like she expected him to focus on her and maybe even express romantic feelings, since he was planning to ask her out. By praising the waitress, maybe she felt he was inconsiderate or not paying attention to her. But is that valid?\n\nOn the other hand, the author's action was a genuine compliment to the waitress. It's a kind gesture, and he did it because he wanted to recognize good service. It's not like he did something inappropriate, like flirting with the waitress. He approached the manager to give feedback, which is a standard practice. So why did she take it as a negative?\n\nThe girl might be feeling neglected or like he's not fully invested in their relationship. If they had several dates and he was close to asking her to be his girlfriend, she might have been expecting a more personal gesture instead of a third-party compliment. Maybe she thought he was trying to show off or that his attention was elsewhere. But that's a bit of a stretch. The author's intention was positive, but the girl's reaction is based on her perception.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he did something kind and appropriate. However, maybe he didn't consider how his actions would affect his date. The key here is intent vs. perception. If the intention was good, but it hurt her feelings, is he at fault? It's possible he could have been more attentive to her cues. But the act itself isn't wrong. So, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. The problem is more about their differing expectations and communication.\n"
