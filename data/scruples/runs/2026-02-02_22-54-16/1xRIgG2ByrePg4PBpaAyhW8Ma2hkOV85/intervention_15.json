I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager she did a great job, and the date took offense.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went on a third date with a girl. They were at a burger place, and the waitress provided good service. There was a minor spill but she handled it well. The author wanted to compliment the waitress by talking to the manager. The date didn't like this and called the author an asshole. Now, the question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nSo, breaking it down. Complimenting someone's work is usually a good thing. The waitress did a good job, and the author wanted to give feedback. But the date was upset. Why? Maybe because the author didn't involve her in the compliment? Like, maybe the date felt left out or thought the author was showing off? Or perhaps the date thought the author was trying to impress her by praising the waitress, which might come off as trying to be magnanimous but not in a way that directly impresses her. \n\nThe waitress was happy with the compliment, and the manager appreciated the feedback. So, from the waitress's perspective, the author did a good thing. The problem is entirely with the date. The author's actions were appropriate in terms of giving positive feedback to the restaurant staff. However, in a dating context, maybe the author should have considered how the date would perceive the action. But why would the date be upset? The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's service. \n\nPossible angles: The date might have felt that the author was trying to be overly generous in front of her, perhaps to show off his own character, which could be seen as insincere. Alternatively, she might have thought that the author was overstepping by involving the manager for a compliment, but usually, it's acceptable to give feedback to management. \n\nThe key point is that the author's action was positive and appropriate. The date's reaction is their own issue, possibly projecting something else. The author didn't do anything unethical or wrong by complimenting the waitress. Even if the date was upset, the author had no way of knowing that. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
