I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The author went on a third date with a girl they really liked. They treated her to dinner, and the waitress provided excellent service. The author decided to compliment the waitress by talking to her manager, which the date took as being full of themselves. The key question is whether the author did something wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's intention was to praise the waitress for good service. That seems positive. They didn't do it to show off or for any negative reason. The date, however, was upset. Why would that be? Maybe she felt it was unnecessary or that he was trying to impress her by being overly polite or showing off to the waitress. But is that a valid reason to be upset?\n\nIn some situations, people appreciate when others acknowledge good service, especially if they're in a service industry. It's a common way to recognize someone's work. The waitress even seemed happy about the compliment. So the action itself isn't inherently negative. The date's reaction might stem from personal insecurities or a different perspective on what's appropriate in a date setting. Maybe she felt he was being too formal or that the gesture didn't fit the casual setting.\n\nBut the author didn't do anything wrong by giving positive feedback. The problem here is more about the date's perception rather than the action itself. The author's intention was to be kind and appreciative. Unless there's a cultural or personal norm that the author violated, which isn't indicated here, the action seems appropriate. The waitress benefited from the compliment, and the manager appreciated the feedback. \n\nThe date's reaction is a personal issue. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to commend someone else for good work. It's possible the date had different expectations for the date night, but that doesn't make the author's action wrong. They might need to communicate better about their preferences, but the act of giving a compliment isn't something to be blamed for.\n"
