I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told the manager their waitress did a great job, but their date was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and the girl were on a third date. They liked each other, and the author was planning to ask her to be his girlfriend. At the restaurant, the waitress provided good service, even after a minor spill. The author wanted to compliment her by talking to the manager. The date took offense, said the author was full of himself, and now they're not responding.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong by complimenting the waitress. The date's reaction is key here. Why was she upset? The author's intention was positive\u2014to praise the waitress. But maybe the date felt that the author was trying to show off or be overly self-centered by bringing up the compliment in front of the manager. The girl might have perceived it as the author trying to impress her in an unnecessary way, or maybe she felt it was an awkward moment that didn't fit the romantic setting they were in. \n\nIs there a cultural or social norm here? Complimenting someone's job in a restaurant is generally a good thing. The author didn't do anything negative, just gave a positive feedback. However, the girl's reaction suggests that she might have had personal feelings about it. Perhaps she was uncomfortable with the attention or thought the author was overdoing it. \n\nBut is the author at fault? The action itself was positive. Unless there was some unspoken rule or prior issue between them about how to handle such situations, the author's action seems reasonable. The girl's reaction is subjective. So, the problem might not be the author's action but the girl's interpretation of it. The author didn't have a malicious intent. Therefore, he's not wrong for giving a compliment. The answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
