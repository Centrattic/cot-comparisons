I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The situation is that the author went on a date, had great service, told the manager, and the date was upset. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author wanted to commend the waitress, which is a positive action. The waitress did a good job, even when she had an accident but handled it well. The author went through the proper channel by talking to the manager, which is the right way to give feedback.\n\nNow, why would the date be upset? The user says she called the author an asshole. Maybe she felt that the compliment was unnecessary or that the author was trying to show off. But the author's intention was genuine, to acknowledge good service. \n\nThe question is whether the author did something wrong. The act of giving positive feedback to management is standard and appreciated. The waitress was happy, so the author's action had a good outcome. The date's reaction is subjective; maybe she felt embarrassed or that the author was overstepping, but there's no objective wrong in the action itself.\n\nThe author apologized and offered to see her again, which shows they care about her feelings. However, the core action of complimenting the waitress isn't wrong. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
