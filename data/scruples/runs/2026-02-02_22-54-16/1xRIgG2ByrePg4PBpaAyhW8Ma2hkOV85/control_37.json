I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the waitress's manager she did a great job. The situation is that the author and their date went to a restaurant, the waitress provided good service, and the author wanted to compliment her by talking to the manager. The date was upset by this and called the author an asshole. Now, the user wants to know if the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the date was upset. The author's action was to commend the waitress, which seems positive. But the date took offense, saying the author was full of themselves. Maybe she felt the author was trying to impress her by doing something trivial or unnecessary. Alternatively, she might have found the action condescending, as if the author was trying to show off or not trusting her to appreciate good service without needing to be impressed by the comment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was genuine. They wanted to recognize the waitress's good work, which is a kind and appropriate action. The waitress even appreciated the compliment, so the action had a positive effect. The manager was also grateful for the feedback. The problem seems to be the date's reaction, not the author's action. \n\nHowever, maybe the way it was done was awkward in the context of a date. If the author was trying to impress the date by showing off their ability to give compliments, that could come off as self-centered. But the story says the author didn't do it to impress the date, but because they genuinely appreciated the service. The date's interpretation might be a misunderstanding.\n\nIs the author wrong? If the intention was good and the action was appropriate, then the author isn't in the wrong. The date's reaction is more a reflection of her own feelings or misinterpretations. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies in the date's perception, not the action itself.\n"
