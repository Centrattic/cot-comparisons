I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went on a date with a girl, and they had dinner. The waitress provided good service, even when she spilled a glass of water but handled it well. The author wanted to compliment her, so he told the manager that the waitress did a great job. His date didn't like that and called him an asshole, and now they're not talking.\n\nHmm. First, the author's intention was to commend the waitress for her good service. That's usually a positive thing. But his date took it the wrong way. Why would she react negatively? Maybe she felt that he was trying to impress her by taking credit for complimenting the staff, or maybe she found it unnecessary. But the author actually went through the proper channel by talking to the manager, which is a standard way to give feedback. The waitress was happy and the manager appreciated the feedback, so the action itself seems appropriate.\n\nBut why did the date get upset? The author mentioned that he was treating her to dinner, maybe trying to be generous. However, the date might have felt that this was a grand gesture meant to show off his good manners or maybe his ability to give compliments in a way that made her feel overlooked. Alternatively, she might have thought that the situation wasn't important enough to involve the manager. It's possible that the date misinterpreted the action as the author trying to take control of the situation or being overly formal. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, he was just recognizing good service. There's no indication that he did anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job or the restaurant's policies. The problem seems to be the date's reaction, not the action itself. The author didn't do anything unethical or improper by giving a compliment through the manager. So the issue here is more about the date's sensitivity to how he chose to express gratitude. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. His action was appropriate, and the conflict stems from the date's personal reaction, not his wrongdoing.\n"
