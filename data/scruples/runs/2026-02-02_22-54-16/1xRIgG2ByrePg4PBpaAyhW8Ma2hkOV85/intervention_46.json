I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. The situation involves a date where the author went out of their way to praise the waitress, which the date apparently took as an attempt to impress her, leading to the date being upset.\n\nFirst, the author's action was to commend the waitress for excellent service. The waitress had done a good job, even handling a spill gracefully. The author's intention was likely genuine, wanting to recognize good service. However, the date reacted negatively, feeling that this was a self-serving gesture to impress her.\n\nNow, the key points here are the intentions and the context. If the author's main goal was to impress the date by showing off their own character (like being a good tipper or a helpful person), then the date's reaction might make sense. But the author claims they were just being honest and appreciative of good service. The date might have interpreted it as the author trying to take credit or show off, even if that wasn't the intent.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Well, complimenting someone's work is generally a good thing. The waitress appreciated it, and the manager was grateful. The problem seems to be in the date's perception. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress or the manager. The issue is a miscommunication or differing expectations in the relationship context. Since the author acted with good intentions and the negative reaction came from the date's perspective, not any actual wrongdoing, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
