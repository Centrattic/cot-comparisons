I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling the manager their waitress did a great job, but the date was upset about it. The story is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) context. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author went out on a date, had good service, and wanted to compliment the waitress by talking to her manager. The waitress had a minor accident but handled it well. The author's action was to bring up the manager to praise her. The date reacted negatively, calling the author an asshole. \n\nThe key points here are the intention and the social context. The author's intention was positive\u2014praising the waitress. But maybe the date found it odd or self-centered. Some people might think complimenting the waitress in front of her is more appropriate, while going to the manager seems like trying to show off or one-up. \n\nBut is that a valid reason to be upset? It's a bit subjective. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress's job; they were just giving feedback. However, in a dating context, the date might have felt that the author was trying to impress her by taking the initiative to commend the staff, which could be seen as unnecessary or even arrogant. \n\nThe waitress appreciated the compliment, and the manager thanked them. So the action had a positive outcome for the waitress. The problem was between the date and the author. The date might have different expectations of how to handle such situations. The author might have overstepped by involving the manager, but that's not a clear violation of any rule. \n\nIn AITA terms, usually, if someone does something that's technically okay but socially awkward, it's a \"No AITA\" because the person isn't in the wrong. The date's reaction is subjective, but the author didn't act maliciously. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
