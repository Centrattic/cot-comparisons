I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress to her manager, which upset his date. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were on a date, the waitress did a great job, even though there was a minor spill that wasn't her fault. The author wanted to commend her, so he told the manager. The date took offense, thinking it was a way to impress her, and the author is confused.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nComplimenting someone's job performance is generally a good thing. The waitress handled the spill well, and the author praised her. But the date was upset. Why? Maybe because she felt the author was trying to show off or focus on someone else instead of her. The author's intention was to acknowledge good service, which is appropriate. However, the date might have felt that the author was trying to impress her indirectly by complimenting the waitress, which could come off as inconsiderate or dismissive of her presence.\n\nBut wait, the author's actions themselves aren't malicious. He was being kind to the waitress. The problem arose from the date's reaction. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of the waitress; it's more about how the date perceived the action. The author might have been unaware of how his action was received. But is that his fault? \n\nIn terms of social norms, complimenting good service is a common and expected practice. The issue here is the date's interpretation. The author isn't wrong for wanting to commend someone who provided good service. However, maybe he didn't consider how his date would feel. But unless there's a rule that you shouldn't compliment others on dates, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the action itself was wrong. The author did something positive, but the date took offense. The problem lies in the date's reaction, not the author's action. Unless the author had a history of undermining his dates or did it in a mocking way, which isn't indicated here, he's not in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B. The author isn't in the wrong because he was recognizing good service, which is appropriate. The date's negative reaction is a personal issue rather than the author's fault.\n"
