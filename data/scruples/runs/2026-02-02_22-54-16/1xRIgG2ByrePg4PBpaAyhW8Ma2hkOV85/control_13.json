I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for complimenting the waitress's manager about her service. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: the guy went on a date with a girl, they had dinner, the waitress was good, even after a minor spill. He wanted to commend her, so he asked for the manager and gave the compliment. The date didn't like it and called him an asshole. Now he's asking if he was wrong.\n\nSo why would the date be upset? Maybe she felt that he was showing off or trying to impress the waitress instead of focusing on her. Or maybe she didn't like that he took the time to give a compliment in front of the manager, which could be seen as unnecessary. But is the guy actually wrong here?\n\nThe key points here are about intention and perception. The guy's intention was to acknowledge good service, which is a common and positive action. He didn't do anything wrong by the waitress\u2014he was complimentary. However, the date might have interpreted it as him trying to be a showoff or not respecting her by engaging with the waitress. \n\nBut the waitress's actions were appropriate, and giving feedback to a manager about service is standard. If the date took it personally, maybe that's her issue. The guy didn't do anything inappropriate. She might have felt neglected during that moment, but that's more about their relationship dynamics than him being wrong.\n\nSo I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He did something positive, and her reaction is more about their personal issues rather than his actions being incorrect.\n"
