I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author went on a date with a girl and had a good time. The waitress was doing a good job, even when she accidentally spilled water but handled it well. The author decided to compliment the waitress by talking to the manager at the end. The date didn't like this and called the author an asshole. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to praise the waitress for good service. Complimenting employees is generally a good thing. The waitress was happy, the manager was grateful. So the action itself seems appropriate. \n\nBut why did the date get upset? Maybe she felt that the author was trying to show off or take credit for the compliment. Or perhaps she didn't like the attention being diverted from them to the waitress. Maybe she was annoyed that the author took the time to talk to the manager instead of focusing on her. \n\nThe key here is the impact on the date. The author's action might have been well-intentioned, but if it caused discomfort or was perceived as inconsiderate, then maybe there's a valid point. However, the author didn't do anything wrong by complimenting the waitress. It's reasonable to acknowledge good service. The date's reaction seems more about her own feelings than the author's action being objectively wrong.\n\nAlso, the author did apologize and wanted to continue the relationship. The date's response was harsh, but that doesn't mean the original action was wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for doing something kind. The answer should be B.\n"
