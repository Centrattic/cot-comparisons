I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author did something wrong by telling the waitress's manager she did a great job, and his date was upset about it. \n\nFirst, the author was on a date, and they had a good experience with the waitress. The waitress even had a small accident but handled it well. The author wanted to compliment her manager to give positive feedback. That seems like a nice thing to do. But his date took it the wrong way, thought he was showing off, and called him an asshole. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, complimenting someone's job performance is usually a good thing. It's a way to acknowledge good service and support the employee. The waitress was happy, and the manager appreciated the feedback. So the action itself seems positive.\n\nBut why did the date get upset? Maybe she felt like he was trying to impress her by showing off his ability to give praise, or perhaps she didn't like that he prioritized complimenting the waitress over their date. Maybe she wanted the focus to be on them, and he mentioned the waitress instead. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to do something kind, not to impress his date. The date's reaction seems a bit over the top if he was just being nice. The author apologized and reached out, but there's no response. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the act of giving a compliment to the waitress isn't wrong. The date's dissatisfaction is her own perspective, but that doesn't make the author wrong. He didn't do anything inappropriate. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
