I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is moving out of their mom's house because their mom has been treating them like a live-in babysitter since the parents split up. They want to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 rent each. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 anymore, which she uses to cover childcare for her younger brother. The person refuses to pay rent after moving out, only offering $50 a month for the dog's expenses. The mom is blocking them from taking their stuff, leading to possible legal action.\n\nFirst, the key issue is whether the person is obligated to pay rent after moving out. Legally, once you move out, you're no longer a tenant, so you don't have to pay rent unless there's a lease agreement that binds you. Since the person is moving out, they're not under any obligation to continue paying. The mom might have been using the rent as a way to cover childcare costs, but that's her responsibility, not the child's. The person is offering $50 for the dog, which is reasonable if they still have a connection to the pet. The mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than actual need, especially since she's upset about losing the $300. The person isn't in the wrong for standing up for their own needs and setting boundaries. The mom's trying to keep their belongings is another issue, but that's about her controlling behavior, not the person's right to refuse rent. So the answer should be B.\n"
