I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is moving out of their mom's house to live with their boyfriend and friends. The mom was upset because she was using the daughter as a babysitter for her younger son. The daughter is not paying rent anymore once she moves out, and the mom is angry, even trying to prevent her from taking her belongings.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and expectations. The daughter was living at home and contributing $300 a month, but the mom was using her as a babysitter instead of paying someone else. Now that she's moving out, she's not obligated to continue paying rent. The mom's argument that she can't afford to pay someone else is her own problem, not the daughter's. The daughter is still offering $50 a month for the dog's care, which shows she's trying to help a bit without overstepping.\n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they aren't responsible for the former household's bills unless there's a contract or some other agreement. The mom's refusal to let her take her belongings is the issue here. The daughter has the right to her possessions, and if the mom is blocking access, that's a problem. The daughter might need to involve authorities to get her things back, which the mom shouldn't be preventing.\n\nEmotionally, the daughter is trying to establish independence after feeling used. The mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than the daughter's well-being. The daughter isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own needs and freedom here. The mom's expectations of continued financial support after the daughter is gone are unreasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The daughter is not in the wrong. She's moving on, setting boundaries, and the mother is overstepping by trying to control her and keep her financially tied. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
