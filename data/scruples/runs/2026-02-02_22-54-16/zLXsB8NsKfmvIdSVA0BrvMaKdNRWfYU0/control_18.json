I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author, almost 20, wants to move out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which seems low. The main issue is the mom treating the author like a live-in babysitter since the parents split. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and needs help watching the brother. The author is offering $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming but not more. The mom is now blocking the author from taking their stuff.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. When someone moves out, they're typically not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's an agreement. The author is moving out, so the expectation is that they're no longer responsible for their parent's expenses. The mom seems to be using the child's previous living arrangements to extract money, which might not be fair. The author is setting boundaries, which is important for their independence. The fact that the mom is trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings is a red flag\u2014maybe she's trying to hold onto the stuff as leverage. The author is standing up for themselves, which is understandable. The $50 for the dog is a nice gesture but not required. The mom's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author is moving out to live independently. Legally, once you move out, you're not responsible for your parent's bills unless you agreed to something else. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
