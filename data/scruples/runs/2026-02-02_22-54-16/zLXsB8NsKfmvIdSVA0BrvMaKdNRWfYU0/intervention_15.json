I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is almost 20 and wants to move out to be with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, including utilities, which they consider a good deal. Their main reason for leaving is that their mom, after the parents' divorce, has been using them as a live-in babysitter while she's with her friend. The mom is upset because she won't get the rent money anymore and is trying to block the person from taking their belongings.\n\nSo, the person is refusing to pay rent after moving out. The key point here is that once you move out, you're no longer obligated to pay rent for the place you're leaving. The mom is upset because she's losing that income, but the person is just ending their tenancy. The mom is asking for more money to help with bills, but the person is setting boundaries, saying they have their own expenses. \n\nThe mom's behavior of acting like a live-in babysitter isn't something the person is required to continue. The fact that the mom is now trying to prevent them from taking their stuff is a problem. Legally, once you move out, you should be able to retrieve your belongings without interference. The person is firm about not continuing to pay, which makes sense because they're not living there anymore. The part about the dog is a bit confusing\u2014maybe they mean their mom has a dog that they used to care for? Or a metaphor? Either way, the person is being reasonable by offering $50 for the dog's food and grooming, which seems like a separate arrangement from rent.\n\nThe mom's anger and trying to withhold belongings could be an overreaction. The person isn't at fault for moving out and not paying rent after that. They're establishing independence, which is normal. The mom's expectation to still receive money post-move might stem from a sense of entitlement, but that's not the case. The person is within their rights to stop paying rent once they leave. The situation might be more about the mom's financial stress than the person's actions. So, the answer is B.\n"
