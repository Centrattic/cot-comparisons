I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves the author moving out of their mom's house because their mom has been treating them like a babysitter since the parents split up. The mom is upset about losing the $300 rent and is now trying to block the author from taking their things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, once someone moves out, they are not obligated to continue paying rent, especially if they were paying before as a tenant. The author is no longer a tenant once they move out, so refusing to pay is not illegal. The mom's claim about needing the money for bills after the move might not hold up legally. The author is also not responsible for the mother's financial situation anymore.\n\nEthically, the author had reasons for moving out, like being treated unfairly as a babysitter and wanting to be with their boyfriend. The mom's behavior seems more about financial loss than the child's well-being. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is understandable. The mom's reaction, including trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings, is problematic and could be a red flag about her behavior.\n\nThe part about the dog adds another layer. The author is willing to help with the dog's expenses, which shows they are considerate. However, the mom is demanding more money, which the author is rightfully refusing. The author's actions here are reasonable because they're setting clear boundaries after moving out.\n\nThe mom's attempt to block the author from taking their belongings is a serious issue. Legally, once someone moves out, they have the right to reclaim their personal property. The author may need legal assistance here, which shows the mom is overstepping.\n\nPutting it all together, the author had valid reasons to move out and isn't obligated to keep paying rent. The mom's behavior is more about her own issues than the author's wrongdoing. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
