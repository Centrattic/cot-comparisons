I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is almost 20, moving out because their mom has been treating them like a babysitter since the parents split. They want to live with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 each. The mom gets angry because she won't get the $300 anymore, which she was using to cover the babysitting for the brother. The person says they aren't responsible for that and offers $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming. The mom demands more money and is now blocking them from taking their stuff.\n\nSo, the question is whether the person is in the wrong for not paying their mom after moving out. \n\nFirst, legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay their parent's bills unless there's a contract. The person is setting boundaries, which is their right. The mom is using the child's old living situation as a financial crutch, which isn't fair. The person is taking responsibility for their own expenses now. The mom's reaction is extreme, even trying to prevent them from taking their belongings. The person might need to involve authorities to get their stuff back. \n\nThe person's reasoning seems valid. They're an adult (almost 20) and moving out is a normal step. The mom's anger stems from financial loss, not the child's well-being. The offer to help with the dog is reasonable, but the mom's demands for more money are unreasonable. The person isn't in the wrong for asserting their independence and financial responsibility.\n"
