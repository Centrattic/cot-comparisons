I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The person is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, including utilities. Their mom was upset because she thought they'd keep paying her $300 a month. The mom is now treating the person like a babysitter for her son since the parents split up. The person is giving $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wants more. Now the mom is trying to block them from taking their stuff, and they might need to call the cops.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the person is wrong for not continuing to pay rent to their mom after moving out. Legally, if you move out, you're no longer obligated to pay rent to your parent unless there's a specific agreement. Since the person is moving into their own place, they're responsible for their own rent there. The mom's expectation that they continue paying her seems to be based on an informal arrangement, not a contractual one. \n\nThe mom is acting out of selfishness, using the child as a babysitter, and then getting angry when the child wants to leave. The person is setting boundaries, which is understandable. The mom's reaction to block their belongings is wrong because the person owns those items. The $50 for the dog is reasonable, but the mom is pushing for more, which isn't fair. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the person isn't wrong for wanting independence and not supporting their mom's lifestyle choices. The mom's behavior is more in the wrong here. The person is trying to do the right thing by setting limits and taking responsibility for their own life. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
