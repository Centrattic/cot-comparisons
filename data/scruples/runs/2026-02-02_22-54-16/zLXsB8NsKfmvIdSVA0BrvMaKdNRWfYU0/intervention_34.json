I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario involves the author moving out of their mom's house, which they've been living in since their parents split up. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 rent and is now struggling to take care of their younger brother. The author is giving $50 a month for their dog's expenses but refuses to pay more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they're generally not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a formal agreement. The author is moving to a new place where they pay $300 per person, which is a separate arrangement. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nThen there's the emotional and familial aspect. The author feels they've been used as a babysitter and want independence. The mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than the child's well-being. The author is willing to split some costs for the dog, which is fair since they own the pet. The mom's attempt to block the author from taking their belongings is a red flag, indicating potential issues with control or emotional manipulation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is required to continue financial support after moving out. Since they're no longer living under the same roof and have their own responsibilities, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their own finances. The mom's responsibilities towards the brother are hers to handle now. The author isn't obligated to help unless it's agreed upon, which it isn't.\n\nAlso, the mom's threat to prevent the author from taking their stuff is a sign of possible emotional abuse or manipulation. The author is standing their ground, which is necessary for their own autonomy. The dog situation is a separate, ongoing commitment, but the author is already contributing there, which is fair.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their independence, managing their own finances, and the mom's reactions are more about her own stress than the child's actions. The correct answer should be B.\n"
