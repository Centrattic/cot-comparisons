I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out this situation. So the user is almost 20 and moving out of their mom's house. They want to move in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 a month for rent and utilities. The main reason they're moving out is because their mom treats them like a babysitter for their younger brother since the parents' divorce. The mom is upset because she expected the $300 in rent, which she's now using for childcare when the user is home. The user says they won't pay rent after moving out, only $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, as the dog is still their mom's. The mom is trying to prevent the user from taking their stuff, so they might need to call the police for a civil standby.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user is in the wrong. The user is moving out, so they're no longer obligated to pay rent. They were living at home and contributing via babysitting, but now they're moving out. The mom expected the rent money, which she's using for childcare. The user is not taking the dog, so they're paying for the dog's needs. The mom is upset and trying to block the user from taking their belongings. \n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they're not responsible for the household bills unless they have a legal obligation, like a lease or a contract. Since the user is moving out, they're probably not bound by any such agreement. The mom's reaction of being angry and holding onto the user's stuff is problematic. She can't prevent them from taking their belongings, even if they were bought while living at home. The user is being reasonable by offering to pay for the dog's expenses, which is separate from rent. \n\nEmotionally, the mom might feel abandoned because she was relying on the $300 to help with childcare, but that's her responsibility now. The user has the right to establish their own living arrangement and manage their finances. The mom's threat to involve the police by not letting the user take their things is unethical and possibly illegal. \n\nSo the user isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. They are taking steps to become independent, and the mom's behavior is inappropriate. The answer should be B.\n"
