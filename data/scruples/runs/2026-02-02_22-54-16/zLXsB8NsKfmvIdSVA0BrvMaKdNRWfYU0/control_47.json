I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not paying rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each. The mom gets upset because she was getting that money as a form of support since the parents split. The author is not taking the dog, but paying $50 for the dog's expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. When someone moves out, they are generally not responsible for the previous rent unless there's a contract or agreement in place. The author was paying rent as part of living in their mom's house, but once they move out, that agreement ends. The mom's anger seems more about losing the financial support rather than the rent itself. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author felt like they were being treated as a babysitter. Moving out is a personal choice, and the mom's reaction might be out of control. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The mom's attempt to prevent the author from taking their belongings is a red flag. Legally, the author owns their stuff and can retrieve it without paying extra. \n\nThe part about the dog is a bit humorous but the author is being reasonable by offering $50. The mom's demands for more money are unreasonable. The author isn't obligated to help with other bills unless there was a prior agreement. The mom's threatening behavior is inappropriate. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't at fault for not paying rent after moving out. The responsibilities end once they leave, and the mom's actions are overstepping. So the answer should be B.\n"
