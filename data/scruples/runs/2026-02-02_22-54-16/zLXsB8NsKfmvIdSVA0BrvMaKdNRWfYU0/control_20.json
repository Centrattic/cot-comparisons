I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is moving out of their mom's house and wants to stop paying rent. Their mom is upset because she expected the $300 and now can't pay for taking care of their brother.\n\nFirst, the user is an adult moving out, which is a normal thing. They were paying rent while living at home, but once they move out, they\u2019re not obligated to continue paying. The mom is using the money as a babysitter for the brother, but the user wasn't in an agreement to help with that. The user is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable.\n\nThe mom is trying to block the user from taking their belongings, which is a red flag. Legally, she can't prevent someone from taking their stuff. The user might need to involve authorities, which shows the mom is overstepping.\n\nThe $50 for the dog is a kind gesture but not required. The mom demanding more money after move-out is unfair. The user is handling their own bills now, which they should do as an independent adult.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re standing up for themselves and their independence. The mom's actions are the problem here.\n"
