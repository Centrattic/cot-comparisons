I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out.\n\nThe person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, including utilities. The main reason they want to leave is because their mom treats them like a babysitter since the parents split up. The mom has a friend with benefits and is using the person as a caretaker for the brother. \n\nThe mom is angry about losing the $300 a month and says she can't afford to pay someone else. The person offers $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom demands more. She's even trying to block the person from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, legally, once you move out, you're not obligated to pay your parents for room and board unless there's a formal agreement. The person bought their own stuff, so the mom can't keep them from taking it. The $300 was rent for the new place, not for staying at the mom's house. The mom is upset about losing that money, but the person isn't in the wrong for not paying her bills after moving out. The person is setting boundaries after being used as a babysitter. The $50 for the dog is a nice gesture, but the mom is overstepping by demanding more. The mom's actions (blocking belongings) are problematic. \n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong. They're taking control of their life and financial independence. The mom's behavior is more at fault here. Answer B.\n"
