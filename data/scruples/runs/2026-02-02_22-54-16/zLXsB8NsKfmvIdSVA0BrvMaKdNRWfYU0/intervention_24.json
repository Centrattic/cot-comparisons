I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is almost 20 and wants to move out. They've been helping their mom by acting as a babysitter for their younger brother since the parents split. Now they're moving out with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 each. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 from them anymore. The person says they'll give $50 for the dog's food and grooming but not more. The mom is trying to block them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, the person has the right to move out once they're an adult. The mom using them as a babysitter isn't fair. The person isn't obligated to pay their mom rent after moving out. The $50 for the dog is a gesture, but the mom's demand for more is unreasonable. The mom's reaction, including trying to prevent them from getting their belongings, is problematic. The person is standing up for themselves, which is their right. The key points are financial independence, the mom's unfair treatment, and the person's right to their belongings. So, the answer is B.\n"
