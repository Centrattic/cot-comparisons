I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong by refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe author is almost 20 and wants to move out to be with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which includes utilities. Their mom is upset because she loses the $300, and she's been relying on the author to help take care of their younger brother since the parents split. The mom is treating the author like a live-in babysitter, while she has a friends-with-benefits (FWB) situation and goes out multiple times a week. The author says they only see their boyfriend once or twice a week at most. \n\nThe author is not paying their mom's bills anymore and is only offering $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming since they can't take the dog. The mom is trying to block the author from taking their stuff, which they bought, and the author is considering calling the cops for a civil standby. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying their mom's bills after moving out.\n\nFirst, let's break it down. The author is moving out, which is a common step towards independence, especially around that age. They were paying $300 in rent, but that was part of their new living arrangement. The mom's anger seems to be about losing that income, not about the author's need to move out. The author is in a situation where they feel overburdened, acting as a babysitter for their brother while their mom has her own social life. They're trying to set boundaries by not continuing to pay her bills and only contributing to the dog's expenses.\n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay their parents' bills unless there was a prior agreement. The author was paying rent to their new place, so they were already not contributing to their mom's household expenses. The mom's claim that she can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother is about her situation, not the author's responsibility. The author is not a child anymore and should be able to manage their own finances. \n\nThe mom's behavior of trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings is problematic. The author has the right to their possessions, and the mom withholding them is a red flag. The fact that the author is considering calling the police suggests that the mom is using emotional leverage or trying to hold things hostage, which is not appropriate. \n\nThe author is offering to cover the dog's expenses separately, which is reasonable. The mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than the actual care of the brother. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to live independently and not continue to support their mom's financial needs. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the author is making a move towards personal independence, and the mom is reacting negatively, possibly out of financial dependence. The author isn't obligated to pay their mom's bills once they're out of the house. The mom's attempt to block the author's belongings is a separate issue, but the author isn't in the wrong for that either. They have the right to their things and can take legal steps to retrieve them if necessary.\n\nI think the key points here are the author's right to leave, their own responsibilities post-move, and the mom's overreaction. The author isn't in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out, so the answer should be B.\n"
