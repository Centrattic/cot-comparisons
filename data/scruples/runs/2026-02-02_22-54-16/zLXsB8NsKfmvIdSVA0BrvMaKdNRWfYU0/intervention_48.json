I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let me look at the details again.\n\nThe author is moving out of their mom's house to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, which includes utilities. The main reason they want to leave is because their mom has been using them as a babysitter for their younger brother since the parents split. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and says she can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The author refuses to pay her mom's bills beyond $50 for their dog's care. The mom is now blocking the author from taking their belongings and even called them an ungrateful brat.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: When someone moves out, they're not legally obligated to continue paying their parent's bills unless there's a specific agreement in place. The author is moving out, so they're no longer residing in the household, and the rent at the new place is separate. The $300 per person in the new home is their responsibility there. The mom's claim that she can't afford to pay for the brother's care is her issue, not the author's, once the author has moved out.\n\nEmotionally, the situation is strained. The mom seems to have used the child as a reason to keep the author at home, perhaps as a caretaker, which isn't fair. The author is trying to establish independence, which is a normal part of growing up. The mom's reaction\u2014being livid and trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings\u2014shows a lack of support for the author's autonomy. The author is standing up for themselves, setting boundaries, and only offering a small monthly payment for the dog they can't take, which is reasonable.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Some might say the author should help their mom out since they were living under the same roof before. But once you move out, you're not responsible for the household's expenses unless you agreed otherwise. The author's contribution to the dog's care is a gesture, not an obligation.\n\nAnother point is the mom's behavior. Trying to block the author from taking their belongings is not acceptable. Legally, the author owns those items and can remove them unless there's a court order or specific agreement. The threat to call the police for a civil standby shows that the author is aware of their rights here.\n\nIn summary, the author is making a reasonable choice to leave and not take on their mom's financial responsibilities. The mom's resentment and actions are counterproductive. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
