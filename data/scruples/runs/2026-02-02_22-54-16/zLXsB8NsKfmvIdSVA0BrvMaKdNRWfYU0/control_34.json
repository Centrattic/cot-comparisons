I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves moving out, a conflict with the mother, and financial responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each. The mother is upset because she was getting money from the daughter before, acting as a babysitter after the parents split. Now, the daughter wants to stop contributing after moving out. The mom is trying to block her from taking her belongings, which might be a legal issue.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility after moving out. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay the parent's bills unless there was a prior agreement. The daughter is taking her belongings, which she bought, so the mom can't legally stop her. The mother's argument about not being able to afford childcare is her problem, not the daughter's, especially since the daughter is now independent.\n\nAlso, the daughter is covering some expenses for her dog, which is fair if the dog is still hers. The mother's demand for more money beyond that seems unreasonable. The daughter isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially since she's moving out and needs to focus on her own expenses now. The mother's actions, like trying to prevent her from taking her stuff, are inappropriate and possibly illegal.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The daughter is taking responsibility for her own life and isn't obligated to support her mother's living situation after moving out.\n"
