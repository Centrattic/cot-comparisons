I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, each paying $300 including utilities. The mom is upset because she was using the daughter as a babysitter for her younger brother after the parents split. The daughter wants to move out because she can't see her boyfriend enough and the mom is treating her like a live-in babysitter. The mom is angry and doesn't want to pay someone else to watch the brother, so she's upset the daughter is leaving. The daughter offers $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wants more. The mom is now trying to prevent the daughter from taking her belongings.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: when someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent to their parents unless they have a lease or agreement. Since the daughter is moving into her own place, she's not responsible for her parents' expenses. The mom's claim that she can't afford to pay for babysitting is her own financial issue. The daughter isn't a child anymore (almost 20), so she's making her own decisions. The mom's trying to block her from taking her stuff is a red flag; that's probably illegal because belongings belong to the individual. The daughter might be right in needing to call the cops for a civil standby.\n\nEmotionally, the daughter feels used, and the mom is acting entitled to the daughter's money. The daughter is trying to set boundaries. The mom's reaction seems manipulative and controlling. The daughter's refusal to pay rent is justified because she's moving out and isn't responsible for her parents' financial situation. The $50 offer is a gesture, but the mom is being unreasonable. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
