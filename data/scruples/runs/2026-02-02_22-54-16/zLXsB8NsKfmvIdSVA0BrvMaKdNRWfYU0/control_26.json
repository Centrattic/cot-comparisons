I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're moving out of their mom's house and refusing to pay rent after they leave. Their mom is upset because she had been treating them like a live-in babysitter since the parents' divorce. The mom is angry about losing the $300, which seems to be her main issue because she can't afford to pay someone else for childcare. The author is offering $50 a month for the dog's expenses, which they still own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they have no obligation to pay rent to their parents unless there was a specific agreement. Since the author is moving out, refusing to pay rent after that point is their right. The mom's demand for money beyond the $50 for the dog seems like it's more about losing the income rather than actual necessity. The author is setting boundaries, which is understandable, especially if they've been overburdened with responsibilities at home.\n\nThe mom's reaction is problematic. She's trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings, which is illegal. She's also being financially coercive, implying she needs the money for childcare, but that's her responsibility post-divorce. The author isn't obligated to support their parents financially once they're adults. The $50 for the dog is a reasonable offer since they still have ownership of the pet.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their independence and financial responsibility. The mom's actions are more harmful and manipulative. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
