I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario involves the person moving out of their mom's house to live with their boyfriend and friends. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 monthly rent and now has to pay for her other child's care. The person offers $50 a month for their dog's expenses but refuses more help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they are not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. Since they're moving into their own place, they would pay their own rent. The mom's anger over losing the $300 seems self-centered, as that was the son's contribution, not a payment from the mom to the child. The mom's claim about needing help with bills after the move might be a stretch because the child is now independent.\n\nEthically, while family support is common, the child isn't obligated to provide financial help after moving out, especially if they're struggling themselves. The mom's behavior\u2014trying to prevent the child from taking their belongings\u2014is problematic and possibly illegal, as belongings belong to the individual. The user's offer to help with the dog's expenses shows consideration but doesn't mean they have to cover all other bills.\n\nThe mom's resentment and accusations of being ungrateful are issues on her part. The child is asserting their independence, which is a normal part of growing up. The key points are the legal right to leave, the lack of obligation to continue financial support, and the mom's overstepping by trying to block the move and take the child's things.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
