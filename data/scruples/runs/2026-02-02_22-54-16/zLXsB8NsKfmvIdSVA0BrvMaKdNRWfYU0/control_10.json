I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves a young adult moving out, and the parent is upset about losing the $300 monthly rent, using it to cover babysitting costs for their brother. The author is giving $50 a month for the dog's expenses but refuses to pay more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they are not obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement in place. The parent's request for continued payments after moving out isn't legally binding unless previously agreed. The author isn't in a lease agreement with their mother; this is more of a household arrangement. \n\nEthically, it's about responsibility and fairness. The parent is using the rent to cover childcare, which shifts from supporting the child's living expenses to covering their own childcare needs. The author is an adult (almost 20) and moving out is a step toward independence. The parent's reaction seems to be more about financial loss than actual childcare needs, especially since the parent has a FWB and isn't providing childcare herself. The author's refusal to pay more beyond the dog's expenses makes sense if they want to establish independence. Also, the parent's attempt to block the author from taking their belongings is problematic, indicating control issues. The $50 for the dog is reasonable, but the parent demanding more is pushing beyond what's fair. \n\nThe key points are: the author isn't legally bound to pay rent after moving out, the parent's demands are about their own childcare, not the author's support anymore, and the parent's behavior (blocking belongings) is inappropriate. So, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing the rent payments after leaving. The answer is B.\n"
