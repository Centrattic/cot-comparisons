I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is almost 20, moving out to live with a boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, including utilities. The main reason for moving out is that the mom has been treating them like a babysitter since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 from the author anymore and claims she can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother 3-4 nights a week. The author offered $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, and the mom wants more help with bills. The author refuses, leading the mom to withhold their belongings, possibly requiring a civil standby.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about financial responsibility and family obligations. The author is moving out, which typically means becoming financially independent. The mom is upset about losing the $300, which is the author's contribution to the household. But once the author moves out, they're no longer part of that household, so they shouldn't be responsible for the mom's bills. The author is still offering $50 for the dog, which they've owned and paid for, so that's reasonable. The mom might be expecting the author to continue supporting her financially even after moving out, which isn't fair. The mom's reaction of trying to prevent the author from taking their stuff is also problematic, as they have a right to their belongings. The author's decision to not pay rent post-move seems correct because they're now in a different living situation and have their own bills to handle. The mom's emotional response and the father's absence after the split might be contributing to the stress, but that doesn't obligate the author to continue financial support. The situation looks like the author is standing up for their independence, which is a right of adulthood. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
