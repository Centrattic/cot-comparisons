I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is almost 20 and wants to move out. They're paying $300 rent with utilities, which they consider a good deal. Their main reason is that their mom has been treating them like a babysitter since the parents split. The mom is upset not because of the babysitting but because she won't get the $300 anymore. The daughter is offering $50 for the dog's expenses but not more. The mom is blocking her from taking her belongings.\n\nFirst, the daughter is an adult almost 20, so legally, she's an adult even if still in school. Moving out is a personal choice. The mom is using the child's belongings as leverage, which is wrong. The daughter isn't obligated to pay her mom's bills after moving out. The $300 was rent when she was living there; once she moves, that stops. The mom's anger seems more about financial loss than actual need. The daughter is being reasonable by offering some support for the dog. The mom's actions of blocking her stuff are illegal, so the daughter might need police help. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking responsibility for their own life and bills, and the mom is being unreasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
