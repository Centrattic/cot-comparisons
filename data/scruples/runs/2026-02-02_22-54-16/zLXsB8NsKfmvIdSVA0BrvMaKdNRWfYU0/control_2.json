I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, the person is moving out because their mom has been treating them more like a babysitter for their brother since the parents split. The mom is upset because she expected rent from the person, which seems more like financial support rather than actual rent. The person is moving into a situation where they pay $300/month, so it's a more independent living arrangement. \n\nThe mom is acting out of self-interest, not wanting to lose the $300, and is calling the person ungrateful. The person is willing to contribute a small amount for the dog, which is reasonable since the dog belongs to the mom. The mom is now trying to block the person from taking their belongings, which is a red flag. \n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent unless there's a lease agreement in place. The scenario doesn't mention a lease, so the person isn't obligated. The mom's behavior of withholding the person's belongings is problematic and possibly illegal. \n\nEmotionally, the person has valid reasons for needing independence and space. The mom's argument about not being able to afford childcare isn't the person's responsibility if they've already made their move. The person is standing up for their rights and setting boundaries, which is healthy. \n\nConsidering all this, the person isn't in the wrong. They're removing themselves from a situation where they were being used and choosing their own path. The mom is the one acting unreasonably by trying to prevent the move and demanding continued financial support. So the answer should be B.\n"
