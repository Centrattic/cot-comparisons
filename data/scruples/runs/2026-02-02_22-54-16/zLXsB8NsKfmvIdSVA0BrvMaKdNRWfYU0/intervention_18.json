I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is almost 20 and moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which includes utilities. The main reason for moving is that their mother has been treating them like a babysitter since the parents split up. The mom has a friend with benefits and the person only gets to see their boyfriend once or twice a week. They informed their mom, who got angry because she won't get the $300 rent anymore. The mom claims she can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The person offers $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wants more and calls them ungrateful. Now, the mom is trying to prevent them from taking their belongings, leading the person to consider calling the police for a civil standby.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the person is obligated to continue paying rent to their mom after moving out. Legally, once someone moves out, there's no obligation to pay rent unless there's a lease agreement. Since they're moving out, they're no longer tenants, so refusing rent is justified. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss rather than any legal entitlement. The person is also offering to help with the dog's expenses, which is reasonable given they own the dog. The mom's demands for more money and trying to block moving out are problematic. The user's position is that the author isn't in the wrong, which I agree with. The key points are the lack of legal obligation, the mother's financial issues being her responsibility, and the person's right to move out and manage their own finances. The mother's actions are overstepping, especially attempting to block the person from their belongings. So the answer should be B.\n"
