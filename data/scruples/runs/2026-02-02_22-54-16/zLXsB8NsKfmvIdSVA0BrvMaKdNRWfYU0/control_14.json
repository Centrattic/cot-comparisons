I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out of their mom's house into their own place with a boyfriend and friends. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 rent and now has to cover the babysitting costs for their brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they're no longer obligated to pay their parent's bills unless there's an agreement in place. The mom might have been using the rent money to help with the family, but legally, once the person leaves, that's their own responsibility now. The mom's reaction seems to be more about financial loss rather than actual need, which could indicate that the initial arrangement wasn't fair or necessary.\n\nThe person is taking responsibility by offering $50 a month for the dog, which is reasonable, especially since the dog stays with the mom. The mom, however, is trying to claim more money, which the person rightfully refuses. The mom's threats to prevent the person from taking their belongings are problematic. Legally, a parent can't stop their adult child from taking their own possessions. The person might need to involve authorities to reclaim their property, which is a civil matter.\n\nEmotionally, the person felt used as a babysitter, which is a valid reason to move out. The mom's anger seems misplaced, focusing on financial loss rather than supporting her child's independence. The person isn't in the wrong for seeking their own living arrangement and setting boundaries after moving out. The key point is that the person isn't obligated to continue financial support once they've left the household. The mom's behavior is more about her own adjustment issues rather than the person's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the person isn't responsible for their mom's financial situation after moving out, and they're acting within their rights to reclaim their belongings and manage their own finances.\n"
