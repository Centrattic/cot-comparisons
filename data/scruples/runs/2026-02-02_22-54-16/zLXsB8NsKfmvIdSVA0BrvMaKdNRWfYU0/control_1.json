I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the user is almost 20, wants to move out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which they think is a good deal. Their mom got really upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore. She's been using the person as a babysitter for their brother since the parents split up. The person is cutting the rent payments because they don't want to support that arrangement anymore. They offered $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, which seems fair since the dog is still theirs. The mom is now trying to prevent them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, the person is moving out, which is their right when they're an adult. The mom was using them as a babysitter, which isn't fair. The person isn't in the wrong for not continuing to pay rent after moving out. The $50 for the dog is reasonable. The mom's reaction of being livid and blocking the move seems wrong. The person isn't obligated to pay their mom after they leave. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
