I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is moving out of their mom's house because their mom has been using them as a babysitter for their younger brother since the parents split up. They want to move in with their boyfriend and friends, where the rent is $300 per person. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 and can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The person refuses to pay her bills beyond $50 a month for the dog's expenses. The mom is trying to block them from taking their belongings.\n\nSo the main question is whether it's right to stop paying rent to the mom after moving out. In most cases, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to continue paying the previous household's bills unless there's a legal agreement. The mom isn't their landlord now; they're moving out. The person is choosing not to give her money beyond what they agreed for the dog. The mom's demands after the move-out might be manipulative, especially since the person is leaving. The fact that the mom is trying to prevent them from taking their own stuff is a red flag. Legally, parents can't stop children from taking their personal belongings, so calling the cops for a civil standby makes sense.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, financial independence, and the parent's behavior. The person is seeking independence, which is a positive step, and the mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than genuine concern. The refusal to pay beyond the agreed $50 is reasonable. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
