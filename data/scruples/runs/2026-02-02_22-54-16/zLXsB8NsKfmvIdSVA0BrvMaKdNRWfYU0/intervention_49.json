I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is almost 20 and wants to move out to be with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, utilities included. The main reason they want to move is because their mom has been treating them like a live-in babysitter for their younger brother since the parents split up. The mom has a friend with benefits (FWB) and sees them multiple times a week, while the author only gets to see their boyfriend maybe once or twice. When the author tells their mom they're moving out, the mom is upset not just because of losing the $300 rent but also because she can't afford someone else to watch the brother. The author offers $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wants more. The mom is now trying to prevent the author from taking their stuff, and the author might call the cops to get a civil standby.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The author's side is that they're an adult moving out, and the mom is using the kids as an excuse. The mom is upset about losing the money, not just the childcare. The author is trying to be fair by offering $50 for the dog, but the mom wants more.\n\nFrom what I know, once someone moves out, they aren't legally obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author is moving into a separate living arrangement where they pay rent there, so the mom can't expect them to continue paying her. The mom's anger seems more about financial loss rather than the childcare situation, which is a problem because the author isn't responsible for that anymore. The author is also trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. The mom's refusal to let them take their belongings is another issue, but the core question is about refusing to pay rent after moving out. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're an adult now and moving out is a normal transition. The mom's demands for continued financial support aren't justified once the author is living independently. The offer for $50 for the dog is a nice gesture, but the mom's asking for more is unreasonable. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
