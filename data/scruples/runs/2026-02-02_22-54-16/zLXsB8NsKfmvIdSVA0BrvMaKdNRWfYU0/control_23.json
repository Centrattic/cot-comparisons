I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each. The mom was upset because she won't get the rent money anymore, which she was using to cover babysitting for the brother. The author is not paying any more rent once they move out and is only giving $50 a month for the dog's expenses. The mom is trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basic premise of renting. Once someone moves out, they are typically not responsible for paying rent to the landlord anymore. In this case, the author isn't the landlord, but their mom is acting as if they expected rent from the child. That's a bit different. Usually, when a child moves out, they stop contributing to the household bills unless there's a prior agreement. The mom might have been using the child's contribution for her own expenses, which could be an issue. \n\nThe author is moving out because the mom isn't treating them as an adult and is being unfair by making them take care of the brother while she has a FWB. The author is cutting off the financial support once they leave, which is reasonable. The mom is upset because she can't afford to pay someone else, but that's her problem now. The author is not obligated to continue paying after moving out. \n\nThe $50 for the dog is a separate matter. The author is still responsible for their own pets, so contributing to the dog's care makes sense. The mom's claim for more money seems like an attempt to get additional support, which the author rightly refuses. \n\nThe mom trying to block the author from taking their stuff is illegal. Once the author has decided to move out, the mom can't prevent them from taking their belongings. Calling the police for a civil standby is a valid step. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom is acting unreasonably by expecting continued financial support after the child has moved out, and trying to block them from their property. The author's actions are justified.\n"
