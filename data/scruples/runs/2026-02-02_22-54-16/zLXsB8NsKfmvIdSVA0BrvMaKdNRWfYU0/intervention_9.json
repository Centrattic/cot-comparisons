I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The scenario is about a young adult moving out, and the mother is upset because she won't get the rent money anymore. The author mentions that the mother is using the child to take care of the brother while she's with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they're not legally obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The mother might have been using the rent as a way to cover childcare, but that's not a legal requirement. The author is setting boundaries, which is important for independence.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. The mother is upset and even trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings. That's a red flag. The author is trying to be responsible by offering to pay for the dog's expenses, which shows they're still considerate but setting limits. The mother's reaction seems more about financial loss and anger than actual need for childcare, which could indicate she's not handling the situation well.\n\nAlso, the author is moving into a place where they have to pay their own share, so it's reasonable they wouldn't continue paying their mom. The mother's demand for more money beyond the $50 for the dog seems unfair, especially since the author has their own bills. The cop involvement part is serious; if the mother is blocking access to belongings, that might be a legal issue against her.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is making a responsible decision to move out and set boundaries. The mother's actions are problematic. The author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
