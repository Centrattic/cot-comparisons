I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is moving out and wants to stop paying rent to their mom. They explain they're helping care for their brother, but their mom is upset because she's not getting the $300 anymore. The mom is treating them like a babysitter, and the person feels they're being exploited. They offered $50 for the dog's care but not more. The mom is now trying to block them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: when someone moves out, they're not obligated to keep paying rent unless there's a lease agreement. The person isn't signing a lease anymore, so they can stop paying. The mom's claim about needing the money for babysitting isn't a legal obligation. The person isn't a legal guardian or responsible for the brother's care, so they aren't bound to help financially unless there's a court order, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical side. The person feels they were used as a babysitter, which is a valid feeling. They're setting boundaries by moving out and not continuing to pay. Offering $50 for the dog is a gesture, but the mom is asking for more, which the person can't or won't do. The mom's reaction is unreasonable for trying to prevent them from taking their belongings. Legally, the person owns their stuff, so the mom can't block them from taking it.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing rent. Legally, they're not. Ethically, if the mom was providing some kind of service or care, maybe there's a different angle, but in this case, the mom is the one being financially affected by the person moving out. The person is taking responsibility for their own life, which is a positive step. The mom's anger seems to stem from losing the financial benefit, not from the person moving out itself.\n\nAlso, the part about the dog: the person isn't taking the dog, so the $50 is a generous offer, but the mom can't demand more. The person isn't responsible for other bills beyond that. The mom's claim of needing help with bills isn't justified if there's no prior agreement.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're not legally or ethically obligated to pay their mom post-moving out. The mom is acting inexcusably by trying to block their belongings.\n"
