I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person. The main conflict is that the mom is upset because she won't get the $300 from the author anymore and is treating the author as a babysitter for the younger brother. The author is not paying rent anymore, but offering $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming. The mom is trying to block the author from taking their stuff, and there's a threat to call the cops.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author is moving into their own place, so they're not required to continue paying their mom rent. The mom might have been using the author as a substitute babysitter, which is a bit of a red flag. Ethically, the author's reasoning is that they're leaving because of the unfair treatment and the mom's double standards (dating someone else while expecting the author to be home). The author is setting boundaries, which is understandable. The mom's reaction seems manipulative, trying to guilt-trip the author into staying by saying she can't afford to pay someone else. The author is cutting ties financially, which they should be doing. The $50 for the dog seems like a gesture but isn't necessary if there's no legal obligation. The mom trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings is a legal issue; the author owns their stuff and can take it, possibly needing police intervention.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They're taking responsibility for their own life, setting boundaries, and not financially supporting their parent beyond what's agreed. The mom's behavior is more concerning here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
