I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves the author moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, and the mother being upset because she won't get $300 a month from them anymore. The mother had been using the author as a babysitter since the parents' divorce.\n\nFirst, the author is moving out, which is a personal decision. They're not legally obligated to pay rent after they leave. The mother's anger seems to stem from losing the financial support, which the author might have been contributing while living at home. But once someone moves out, they're no longer required to pay their parents for housing they're not using. \n\nThe author is offered room and board by the mother, but that's a family arrangement, not a landlord-tenant situation. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not continuing to pay after moving out. The mother's reaction is more about her financial situation and needing childcare, which isn't the author's responsibility anymore. \n\nThe part about the dog is a bit tricky. If the author owns the dog, they're not obligated to pay for it, but since they gave the dog to the mother, maybe a small contribution makes sense. However, the author is offering $50 a month for the dog's care, which seems reasonable. The mother asking for more money is pushing beyond what's reasonable.\n\nAlso, the mother trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings is a red flag. Legally, the author owns their stuff, and the mother shouldn't be blocking that. The author's plan to call the cops is justified here.\n\nPutting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a responsible move to leave a situation where they were overburdened, and they're not obligated to continue financial support once they're out. The mother's behavior is what's problematic, not the author's decision.\n"
