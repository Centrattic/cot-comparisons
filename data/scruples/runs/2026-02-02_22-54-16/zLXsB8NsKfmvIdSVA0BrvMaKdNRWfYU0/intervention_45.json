I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out at almost 20, which is considered an adult age in many places. They were paying rent to their mom while living at home, and now they're moving out with a boyfriend and friends. The mom is upset because she won't get the $300 a month anymore and is treating the person like a live-in babysitter for their brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In most cases, when someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay their parents unless there was a prior agreement. The person bought their own stuff, so they have a right to take them, even if the mom is trying to stop them. The mom's argument about not being able to afford a babysitter isn't the person's responsibility once they move out. Also, the person is offering $50 for the dog's care, which is reasonable since they still have a responsibility for the pet, even though they can't take it.\n\nThe mom's reaction seems to be more about financial loss than any legitimate need. The person is an adult and moving out is a typical step towards independence. Refusing to pay rent after moving out is normal because they're no longer living there and the arrangement was for staying in the house. The mom's attempts to prevent the person from taking their belongings could be a legal issue, so calling the police for a civil standby is appropriate.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They are asserting their independence, and the mom's expectations aren't valid in this context. The answer should be B.\n"
