I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is almost 20 and moving out, which is a major step toward independence. They've been helping their mom watch their brother after the parents' split, but now they want to live with their boyfriend. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 rent and can't find someone else to take care of the brother.\n\nThe user says they're not paying rent anymore, but they're still contributing $50 for the dog's care. The mom is trying to stop them from taking their belongings, which they legally own. The user is considering calling the police for a civil standby.\n\nFirst, legally, once you move out, you're not obligated to pay your parents for rent unless there's a legal agreement. The user is paying a separate arrangement for the dog, which is reasonable. The mom's anger about losing the $300 might be more about financial loss than the child's well-being. The user is also trying to set boundaries, which is important for autonomy. The mom's actions in preventing access to their belongings could be legally problematic. So overall, the user is in the right. Answer B.\n"
