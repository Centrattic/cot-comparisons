I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is almost 20 and moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person including utilities, which they consider a good deal. The main issue is that their mom is upset they're not paying her for room and board after moving out. The person argues that the mom is using them as a babysitter since the parents split, and the mom has a FWB who she sees often, while the person can only see their boyfriend once or twice a week. The mom is angry because she's losing the $300 a month and can't afford someone else to watch the brother. The person offers $50 for the dog's food and grooming but refuses to help with other bills. The mom is now trying to prevent them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. Let's break down the key points. The person is legally an adult, almost 20, and moving out. Parents aren't obligated to support adult children financially once they're independent. The mom's argument is that she can't afford to pay for the brother's care, but that's her financial situation, not the author's responsibility. The author is offering some help with the dog ($50) which seems reasonable, especially since they still own the dog. The mom's claim that she can't afford to pay someone else is her own problem; the child isn't a child anymore, so there's no legal or moral obligation to continue supporting the parent financially. \n\nThe mom's actions of trying to block the person from taking their things are problematic. If someone owns their belongings, they can take them, and the mom shouldn't be able to prevent that. The person is within their rights to call the cops for a civil standby if needed. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a reasonable decision to move out, and their refusal to pay their mom's bills is justified. The mom's anger and attempts to prevent them from taking their things are her issues, not the author's fault. The answer should be B.\n"
