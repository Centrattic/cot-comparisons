I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario is that the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, where the rent is $300 per person including utilities. They mention that their mom was upset because she won't get the $300 anymore and is treating them like a babysitter for their brother since the parents split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. When someone moves out, they're no longer obligated to pay rent to their parent unless there's a legal agreement in place. Since the author is moving out on their own to a new place, it's reasonable they wouldn't continue paying their mom. The mom's argument is based on her needing the money to cover childcare costs, but that's her responsibility now, not the author's. The author offered $50 for the dog's care, which seems fair as they still have the dog, but the mom wants more, which the author refuses. The mom then tries to block the author from taking their belongings, which is a red flag. Legally, parents can't prevent someone from taking their personal possessions. The author might need to involve authorities if the mom is blocking access. \n\nEthically, the author is prioritizing their own life and relationships. The mom's role as a caregiver for the brother is her responsibility now. The author shouldn't be financially responsible for that if they're moving out. The mom's anger and the attempt to withhold belongings is more about her resentment than the author being wrong. The author is acting within their rights to move on, and the $50 offer is a kind gesture, but not required. The mom's behavior, especially trying to prevent the author from taking their stuff, is more about her own issues than the author's wrongdoing. So, the answer should be B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
