I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants a confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is almost 20 and wants to move out. They're moving in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person for rent and utilities. The main reason they want to leave is because their mom has been treating them like a babysitter for their younger brother since the parents' divorce. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 from the author's potential rent if they move out, and she claims she can't afford to pay someone else for the childcare duties. The author is offering $50 a month for the dog's expenses but refuses to pay more. The mom is now trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is an adult, moving out, not paying rent anymore, and the mom is upset because she expects financial support. The author is not in a position to pay rent anymore, which is standard when you move out. Parents can't force adult children to pay rent unless there's an agreement, but the author isn't staying in the mom's house anymore. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss, but the author is not obligated to pay her. The mom's actions of blocking the author from taking their belongings are problematic and possibly illegal, which the author might need legal help for.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, once you move out, you're not responsible for paying rent to your parents unless you have a contract, which is unlikely in a parent-child relationship. The mom's argument about childcare is her own responsibility now. The author is making a reasonable offer for the dog's expenses, which is a gesture of goodwill. The mom's retaliation by withholding the author's belongings is inappropriate and possibly illegal. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
