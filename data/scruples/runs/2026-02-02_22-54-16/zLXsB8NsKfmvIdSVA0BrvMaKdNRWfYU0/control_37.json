I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is almost 20 and wants to move out. They have a boyfriend and friends they're moving in with, and the rent is $300 per person including utilities. The main issue is that after moving out, the mom is upset because she's losing the $300 and now has to hire someone to watch the brother. The user refuses to pay rent anymore and offers $50 for dog-related expenses. The mom is blocking them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. Once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent to their parent unless there's a formal lease agreement. Since the user is moving out, it's their right to leave and not pay anymore. The mom's anger about losing the money isn't the user's responsibility. The user isn't required to compensate her for her new expenses. \n\nThe mom's threat to prevent the user from taking their belongings is a legal issue. The user bought their stuff, so they have a right to take it. The mom can't legally block that. The user might need to involve authorities here.\n\nEmotionally, the user feels used, being treated like a babysitter. Moving out is a reasonable step for independence. The $50 for the dog is a separate gesture, but not required. The mom's reaction seems selfish, using the brother's care as leverage.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They're exercising their right to leave and aren't legally or morally obligated to continue supporting their mom financially. The mom's actions are the problem here.\n"
