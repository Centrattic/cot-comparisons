I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which seems low. The main reason for moving out is that their mom has been treating them like a babysitter for their younger brother since the parents split up. The mom is upset not just about the lack of support for the brother but also because she won't be getting the $300 rent anymore. The person offers to pay $50 for their dog's care, but the mom wants more money, leading to conflict over belongings.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author is moving into a separate residence, so they're no longer under their mom's roof. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss rather than the child moving out itself. The author is also trying to set boundaries, which is a common issue in adult children moving out. The dog situation is a bit of a red herring, as the author can't take the pet, so the $50 for the dog's care is a gesture, not part of rent.\n\nThe mom's behavior\u2014calling the author names and trying to prevent them from taking their things\u2014is problematic. Legally, a parent can't prevent an adult child from taking their belongings unless there's a legal hold, which isn't mentioned here. The author might be justified in calling the police for a civil standby to retrieve their stuff, which suggests the mom is overstepping.\n\nThe AITA aspect usually hinges on social norms and expectations. While it's common for parents to be upset when kids move out, the mom's reaction seems to be more about financial dependency than genuine concern. The author is not in the wrong for standing up for their independence and financial autonomy. The mom's demands for continued financial support beyond what's reasonable after moving out are where the issue lies.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
