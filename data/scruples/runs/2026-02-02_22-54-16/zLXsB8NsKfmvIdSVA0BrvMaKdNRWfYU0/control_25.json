I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is almost 20 and wants to move out. They're moving in with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 per person, including utilities. The main reason they want to leave is because their mom treats them like a live-in babysitter since the parents split up. The mom has a friend with benefits she sees a lot, while the author only gets to see their boyfriend once or twice a week. \n\nWhen the author tells their mom about moving out, the mom gets really angry because she won't get the $300 rent anymore. She says she can't pay someone to watch the brother 3-4 nights a week. The author refuses to pay more than $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, which they consider their responsibility since the dog is their pet. The mom then demands more money for other bills, but the author says they can't afford it. The mom calls the author ungrateful and is trying to stop them from taking their stuff, so the author might have to call the cops.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out? Let's break it down. First, the author is moving out, which is their right. They're setting boundaries because they feel exploited. The mom is using the child as a babysitter, which isn't appropriate. The author is trying to be fair by contributing some money for the dog, which is reasonable. The mom's reaction is extreme, trying to block the author from taking their belongings, which is a red flag. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't required to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author isn't in a lease situation, so refusing to pay is understandable. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial issues, not the well-being of the author or the brother. The author is standing up for themselves, which is a good thing. The mom's behavior is controlling and manipulative. So the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
