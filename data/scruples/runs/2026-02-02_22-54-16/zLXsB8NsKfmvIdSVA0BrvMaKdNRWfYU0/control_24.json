I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves moving out to live with a boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person including utilities. The main conflict is that the mother is upset because she used to get the rent money and now she can't afford to pay someone else to watch the younger brother.\n\nFirst, the writer is moving out, which is a personal decision and a common step towards independence. The mother's objection seems to be financial, not about the move itself. The writer isn't in a position where they're legally obligated to continue paying rent once they've moved out. The mother's role in watching the brother was a responsibility before the move, but now that the writer is moving out, it's the mother's responsibility to adjust her arrangements. The writer is even offering $50 for the dog's care, which is reasonable if they had previously covered such expenses.\n\nThe mother is trying to block the writer from taking their belongings, which is a red flag. Legally, the mother shouldn't be able to prevent someone from taking their own possessions. The writer is considering calling the police, which they have the right to do. The mother's anger and attempts to block the move suggest she's not handling the situation maturely. \n\nThe key points here are the writer's right to move out, the mother's financial struggles, and the legal right to possessions. The writer isn't in the wrong because they're not required to continue paying rent after moving out. The mother needs to find her own solution for childcare. The writer's decision to move out is about their well-being and independence, and refusing to pay rent is a reasonable action since they're no longer residing there. The mother's behavior is the issue here, not the writer's. The answer should be B (No).\n"
