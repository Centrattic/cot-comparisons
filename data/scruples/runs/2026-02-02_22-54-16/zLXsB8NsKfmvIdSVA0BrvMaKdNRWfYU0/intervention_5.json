I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario involves moving out to live with a boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each including utilities. The mother is upset because she was getting that $300 as a form of support, maybe, since the parents split up.\n\nThe key points here are that the person is moving out and no longer living under their mother's roof. Legally, once you move out, you're not obligated to continue paying rent to your parents unless there was a prior agreement. The mother is treating the person as a live-in babysitter, which seems unfair. The person is trying to establish independence, which is a common step in becoming an adult.\n\nThe mother's reaction is intense, even to the point of trying to block the person from taking their belongings. That's a red flag. The person is willing to contribute $50 a month for the dog's expenses, which is reasonable since the dog is staying with the mother. The mother is asking for more money, but the person has their own bills to manage.\n\nLooking at the legal side, once you leave a parent's home, there's no legal obligation to continue paying them unless there's a contract, which isn't mentioned here. The mother's refusal to let the person take their stuff is a problem. The person might need to involve authorities to reclaim their property, which is their right.\n\nEmotionally, the mother is upset, but her actions are overstepping. The person is making a mature decision to live independently, which is a positive step. The mother's resentment over losing the financial support is her issue, not the person's. The person isn't at fault here for setting boundaries and prioritizing their own needs and relationships.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
