I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for not paying rent after moving out. They're almost 20, moving in with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 per person including utilities. The main issue is that the mom was upset because she's losing the $300 and now needs to pay for babysitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person is moving out, which is a common step towards independence. They were paying rent at home before moving out, so now they're no longer living there, so it's reasonable they don't want to pay rent anymore. The mom is angry because of financial loss, but that's her problem, not the person's. The person does offer to pay $50 a month for the dog's care, which is reasonable if they're keeping the dog. The mom's reaction\u2014trying to prevent them from taking their stuff\u2014is a red flag. Legally, if someone moves out, they should be allowed to retrieve their belongings. The mom's trying to stop them could be a form of emotional blackmail or even legal harassment.\n\nThe person's responsibility is to their own new living situation and their own bills. The mom's financial needs shouldn't fall on the child, especially since the child is now independent. The fact that the mom has a fwb (friends with benefits) and the person has limited time with their boyfriend might not be directly relevant, but it shows the strained relationship contributing to the move. \n\nAlso, the person is not refusing to pay for everything. They're still contributing for the dog, which is a considerate action. The mom's demand for more money to help with other bills is unreasonable. Parents aren't typically entitled to support from adult children unless there's a legal obligation, which in most cases ends when the child is no longer a minor living at home. \n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong for not paying rent once they've moved out. The mom's behavior is more problematic here. The correct answer should be B.\n"
