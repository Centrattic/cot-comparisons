I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person including utilities. Their mom is upset because she won't get the $300 anymore and is trying to stop them from taking their stuff. The person is offering $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming but not more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The parent might have been using the rent as a way to cover childcare costs, but that's not the child's responsibility once they're independent. Ethically, the person has the right to leave their parent's home, especially if the living situation is unhealthy. The parent's anger and attempts to prevent the person from taking their belongings are problematic. The person is being reasonable by offering some financial help for the dog, which is their pet. The parent's reaction seems to stem from financial stress but isn't the child's responsibility. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
