I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out of their mom's house to live with their boyfriend and friends. They were paying rent (or helping out with bills) at home, but now they're moving out, and the mom is upset because she's losing that $300 a month. The mom is also using their younger brother's care as a reason to be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Once someone moves out, especially as an adult, they're generally not obligated to continue paying their parents unless there's a specific agreement in place. The person is now living independently and has their own financial responsibilities. The mom's claim about not being able to afford babysitting isn't the person's responsibility unless there was a prior agreement where they were helping with the brother as part of their living arrangement. But the person is stating they were acting as a live-in babysitter because of their parents' split, which might not be a formal agreement.\n\nThe person is offering $50 a month for their dog's expenses, which they still own. That seems reasonable. The mom is asking for more money for other bills, but the person is declining, which makes sense because they're now living elsewhere and have their own bills. The mom's attempt to prevent the person from taking their belongings is a red flag. That's a legal issue\u2014people have the right to their personal property, and a parent can't legally stop someone from taking their things, even if there's a dispute. The person might need to involve law enforcement to retrieve their belongings, which is the right course of action.\n\nLooking at the ethical side, the person is seeking independence and has a valid reason for leaving due to being treated like a babysitter. The mom's reaction seems to be more about financial loss and resentment rather than genuine concern for the child's well-being. The person didn't agree to continue supporting the household financially once they move out, which is their right. The mom's anger and actions (blocking the person from taking their stuff) are inappropriate and possibly illegal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. They're taking steps to become independent, reducing their financial support to just the dog-related expenses they agreed to, and the mom's behavior is counterproductive and unreasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
