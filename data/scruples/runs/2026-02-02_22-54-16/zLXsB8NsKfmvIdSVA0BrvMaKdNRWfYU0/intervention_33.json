I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is almost 20, moving out of their mom's house. The main reason is that their mom treats them like a babysitter for their younger brother since the parents' divorce. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 rent and can't afford to pay someone else for childcare. The author offers $50 a month for the dog's expenses but refuses to pay more. The mom is trying to block the author from taking their belongings.\n\nI should consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone moves out, they\u2019re not obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The author bought their own stuff, so the mom can't legally prevent them from taking their belongings. Ethically, the author is seeking independence, which is common at that age. The mom's reliance on the child for childcare might be problematic, but the author isn't responsible for that situation. Offering $50 for the dog is a gesture, which shows some consideration. The mom's reaction, including trying to block access to belongings, is over the line.\n\nSo, the author's actions seem justified. They\u2019re prioritizing their own needs and independence, which is reasonable. The mom's anger stems from financial loss and dependency, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (no).\n"
