I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is about a young person moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, where the rent is $300 per person including utilities. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 and can't handle the babysitting anymore. The author is offering $50 for the dog's food and grooming but not more, and the mom is trying to block them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Once someone moves out, they're generally not obligated to pay rent anymore unless there's a lease agreement or some prior arrangement. The author bought their own stuff, so the mom can't legally prevent them from taking their belongings. The part about the dog is interesting. If the dog is the author's pet, then they're responsible for its care. But since the dog is staying with the mom, the author is offering to cover the food and grooming costs. That seems reasonable. \n\nThen there's the emotional component. The mom is treating the author as a babysitter, which is causing tension. The author feels the need to move out for their own well-being. The mom is upset because of the financial loss, but the author isn't responsible for her financial situation once they've moved out. The mom's reaction of being livid and trying to block the author's belongings is more about her own loss than the author's obligations. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong because they were paying rent while living at home, and upon moving out, that responsibility stops. Offering $50 for the dog is a gesture, but not a legal obligation. The mom's demands for more money to help with other bills aren't justified unless there was an agreement. The author's own bills are their responsibility. The mom's behavior now seems more like trying to hold onto the financial support, which isn't the child's responsibility once they're independent. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
