I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, including utilities. The main reason for moving out is that their mom has been treating them like a babysitter since the parents' divorce. The mom is upset about losing the $300 and is trying to block the person from taking their belongings.\n\nThe person is refusing to pay rent after moving out, which is normal because once you move out, you don't pay rent to your previous landlord (in this case, the mom). However, the mom is now asking for money to cover other bills. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying.\n\nLegally, once you move out, you're not obligated to continue paying rent to the previous landlord. Since the mom is now the landlord (assuming the house is hers), but the person is moving out, there's no legal obligation to pay her. However, the mom is using emotional leverage, saying she can't afford to pay for the brother's care. But the person isn't responsible for that; they were acting as a babysitter due to the mom's situation, not a formal agreement.\n\nThe mom is also trying to prevent the person from taking their belongings. Legally, the person owns their stuff, so the mom can't prevent that. The person might need to involve the police for a civil standby.\n\nEthically, the person is standing up for themselves after being exploited. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss, not the child's well-being. The person is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable at their age.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're not obligated to pay rent post-moving out and are taking reasonable steps to regain their belongings. The mom's actions are inappropriate and self-serving.\n"
