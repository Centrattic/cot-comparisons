I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves moving out due to a strained relationship with their mom, who's using them as a babysitter. The key points here are the mom's reaction and the financial aspect.\n\nFirst, the person is moving out to live independently with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which seems affordable. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 she's been getting as \"rent,\" but actually, that's more like a payment for babysitting her brother. The person clarifies they want to move out because of the unfair dynamic post-divorce, where the mom is neglecting her responsibilities and relying on the child to take care of her brother. \n\nThe mom is trying to block the person from taking their belongings, which is a legal issue. The person is considering calling the cops, which they have the right to do if the mom is preventing them from retrieving their property. \n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong for not paying their mom's bills after moving out. From a legal standpoint, once you move out, you're not obligated to pay someone else's bills unless there's a prior agreement. The mom's financial situation shouldn't be the responsibility of the child once they're living independently. The person is also offering to help with the dog's expenses, which is a reasonable gesture but not mandatory.\n\nThe mom's anger seems misplaced. She's upset because she's losing a financial benefit, but the child is now an adult (nearly 20) and has the right to live independently. The person isn't in the wrong for not paying her bills; that's a matter of personal responsibility and independence. The mom's actions in trying to prevent the person from taking their things are more concerning and possibly illegal. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their independence and not taking responsibility for their mom's financial issues after moving out. The mom's behavior is the problem here, not the person's decision to stop paying her bills.\n"
