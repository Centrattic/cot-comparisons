I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 rent and has to watch the brother more.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: When someone moves out, they're no longer obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a lease agreement. Since the author is moving to a new place with their own rent, it's reasonable they don't owe the mom rent anymore. The mom's claim about losing $300 might be about the arrangement she had, but the author isn't required to continue that after moving out.\n\nThen there's the emotional angle. The author feels they were treated like a babysitter, which adds context to their decision to leave. The mom's anger seems more about the financial loss than the child moving out, which might indicate that the mom was using the rent as a way to cover her own expenses, not just for housing. The author offering $50 for the dog's care shows they're trying to be fair by helping with the pet, but the mom isn't satisfied and is now blocking access to belongings. That's a red flag\u2014using emotional manipulation and controlling behavior isn't okay.\n\nThe author's responsibility: Once they move out, they're not responsible for their parents' bills. The mom's need to watch the brother is her issue to resolve. The author can't be expected to subsidize their parent's lifestyle after leaving. The mom's actions in trying to prevent the author from taking their things are wrong, and the author is right to consider legal help to retrieve their belongings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their independence and not being held financially responsible for their parent's situation post-move out. The mom's behavior is the problem here, not the author's refusal to pay.\n"
