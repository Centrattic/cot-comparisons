I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is almost 20, moving in with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 per person including utilities. The mom is upset because she was used to getting that money and now can't afford to pay someone to watch the brother. The author isn't paying rent anymore but is offering $50 a month for the dog's care.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they're no longer responsible for the rent of the previous home. The author is moving into a new place, so they should handle their own expenses there. The mom can't legally force them to pay rent after they leave because they're no longer a tenant.\n\nThen, the emotional and family dynamics. The author feels they were treated like a babysitter after the parents' split, which is a valid reason for wanting independence. The mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than the child's well-being. Offering $50 for the dog's care shows some responsibility, but it's not rent. The mom's trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings might be a conflict point, but the author bought those things, so they have a right to them. The police involvement for a civil standby could be necessary if the mom is blocking access to personal property.\n\nAlso, the age of the author is important. At almost 20, they're an adult (depending on the country, but in the US, 18 is the age of majority). Adults are generally expected to be financially independent, so refusing to pay rent after moving out is reasonable. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially if the living situation was exploitative. The mom's demand for more money beyond the dog's care is unreasonable since the author isn't living there anymore. So, the answer seems to be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
