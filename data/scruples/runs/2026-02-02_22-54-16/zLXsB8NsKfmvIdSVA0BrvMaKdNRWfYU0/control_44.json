I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is 19 almost 20, moving out of their mom's house. They want to move in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 a month. The main issue is that the mom is upset because she won't get that $300, and she's treating the person as a live-in babysitter for their brother. The mom is also in a friends-with-benefits relationship multiple times a week, while the person barely sees their boyfriend. The person offered to pay $50 a month for the dog's care but refused to help with other bills. The mom is now trying to prevent them from taking their belongings.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. Legally, once you move out, you're not obligated to pay rent unless there's a written agreement. The mom's anger seems to be more about losing the income rather than the actual need for childcare. The person is providing for their own responsibilities and not taking the dog, which isn't allowed. The mom is acting selfishly by trying to block their stuff. The person is not in the wrong here; they're making a choice to prioritize their life and independence. The answer should be B."
