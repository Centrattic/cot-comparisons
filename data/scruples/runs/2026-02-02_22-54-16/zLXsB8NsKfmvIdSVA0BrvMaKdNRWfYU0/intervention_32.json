I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is moving out at almost 20, moving in with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which includes utilities. The main reason for moving out is because their mom, after the parents' divorce, is treating them like a babysitter for their younger brother. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 rent and can't afford to cover the brother's childcare costs now. The author offers $50 a month for the dog's care but refuses to pay more. The mom is trying to block the author from taking their belongings, leading to a possible police call.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying the mom after moving out. Let's consider legal and moral angles. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay their parent's bills unless there's a formal agreement. The author is not a minor anymore and is moving into their own place, so the financial responsibility shifts. The mom's argument is about her not being able to afford childcare, but that's her responsibility now that the author is moving out. The author is being independent, which is typical for someone moving out. The mom's reaction seems more about losing income rather than the child's welfare, given her FWB situation. The author is offering some support for the dog, which shows they're not entirely cutting off support. The mom's blocking the author from their belongings is a red flag; they have the right to their possessions. \n\nMoral responsibility here is tricky. While the author might feel a duty to help, they're also trying to establish independence. The mom's behavior\u2014using the child as a babysitter and then being upset when they leave\u2014shows a lack of support for the author's autonomy. The refusal to pay rent post-move is reasonable because the author is now living on their own and responsible for their own expenses. The mom's demands for more money beyond the dog's care don't make sense if there's no ongoing financial agreement. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They're asserting their independence and are not legally or morally obligated to continue supporting their mom financially after moving out. The mom's actions are problematic, and the author is in the right to take back their belongings without paying her bills.\n"
