I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person including utilities, which they consider a good deal. The main reason for moving out is that the mother has been treating them like a babysitter since the parents split up. The mother is upset because she won't get the $300 anymore and can't afford to pay someone else for 3-4 nights a week. The author offers $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, and the mother is trying to block them from taking their stuff, possibly leading to a civil standby.\n\nFirst, legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent unless there's a written agreement. But the author is talking about moving into a new place, so the question is whether they should continue paying their mom. The mother's reaction is emotional, focusing on the financial loss and using the dog as a reason. The author is setting boundaries after feeling used as a babysitter. The mom's argument about not being able to afford other childcare is her own problem, not the author's responsibility. The author is offering to help with the dog, which is reasonable. The mother is now trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings, which could be a legal issue. The author might be in the right by not paying rent after moving out, especially if there's no formal agreement. The mom might be projecting her own needs onto the author, which isn't fair. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
