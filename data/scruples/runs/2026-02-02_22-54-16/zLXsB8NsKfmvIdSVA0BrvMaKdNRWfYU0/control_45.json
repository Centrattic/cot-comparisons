I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is almost 20, moving in with a boyfriend and friends where rent is $300 per person including utilities. The main reason for moving out is that the mom is treating them like a live-in babysitter since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she won't get $300 from the author anymore and can't afford to pay someone else for the babysitting. The author says they can't take their dog, so they offer $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming. The mom wants more money for other bills, but the author can't help due to their own expenses. Now, the mom is trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings, so they might call the cops.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong by not paying their mom's rent after moving out. The key points here are the author's right to move out, whether they are obligated to continue paying rent post-move, and if the mom's actions are justified in blocking them from taking their stuff.\n\nIn most cases, once someone moves out, they are no longer responsible for the rent of the previous residence. The author was paying rent while living at home, but now they're moving out. The mom's anger seems to stem from losing that income, which isn't the author's responsibility. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable if they were being used as a babysitter. The $50 for the dog is a gesture, but not an obligation. The mom's attempt to block the author from taking their belongings is a red flag\u2014emotionally, maybe she's upset, but legally, the author has the right to their possessions. The mom's actions might even be considered holding onto someone's property without consent, which could be a legal issue.\n\nSo the author is not in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. They have the right to leave and manage their own finances. The mom's response is inappropriate, especially trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings. The answer should be B for No.\n"
