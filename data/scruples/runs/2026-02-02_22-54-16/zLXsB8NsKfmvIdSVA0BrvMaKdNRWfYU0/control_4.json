I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 each, which seems affordable. The mom is upset because she had the person acting as a babysitter for the brother since the parents split. The mom is now demanding more money from the person, even after they move out, to help with bills. The person is refusing and only offering $50 for the dog's care.\n\nFirst, legally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay the former household's bills unless there's a specific agreement. The person bought their own stuff, so they should be able to take it. The mom's anger seems more about financial loss than actual child care, which is probably why she's trying to block the person from taking their belongings.\n\nEmotionally, the person is dealing with an unfair situation where they were expected to be a live-in caregiver. Moving out was a way to get their own space and freedom. The mom's reaction is extreme, trying to prevent the person from taking their things is not justifiable. The person isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and refusing to pay after moving out. The $50 for the dog is a gesture, but not required. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
