I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is almost 20 and moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, which includes utilities. The main reason for moving out is that the mother has been treating them like a live-in babysitter since the parents' divorce. The mom has a friend with benefits and sees her multiple times a week, while the author only gets to see their boyfriend once or twice a week. \n\nThe mom got angry because she won't get the $300 rent anymore and said she can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The author offered $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, since the dog is still with the mom. The mom wants more money for other bills, but the author refuses and says they have their own bills. The mom called them ungrateful and is now trying to prevent them from taking their stuff, so the author might need to involve the police.\n\nSo the key points here: The author is moving out, which is their right as an adult. The mom is upset about losing the $300, which seems more about financial support rather than actual childcare costs. The author was providing informal childcare, but now wants to leave. Offering $50 for the dog is reasonable, but the mom is asking for more. The author is refusing to pay more, which is their choice since they're no longer living under the same roof.\n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent or other household bills unless there's a contract or legal agreement. The mom's claim that she can't afford childcare might be true, but that's her responsibility now. The author isn't in the wrong for not continuing to support the household financially after moving out. Also, the mom's behavior of trying to block the author from taking their belongings is problematic and may be illegal, which the author is willing to address with the police, which is the right step.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re making a choice to move out and focus on their own life and responsibilities. The mom's actions are more about her needing financial help, not the author being at fault.\n"
