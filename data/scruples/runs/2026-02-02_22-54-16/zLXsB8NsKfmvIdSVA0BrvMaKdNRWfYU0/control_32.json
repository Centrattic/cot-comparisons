I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a young adult moving out and not paying rent, and the mother is upset because she loses the $300. The person is also dealing with their mom treating them like a babysitter after the parents split.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the person is at fault. The main points here are the decision to move out and not pay rent anymore. The mother is upset about losing the money, which seems like it's not just about rent but also about the financial support. The person is paying $50 for the dog's food and grooming, which they own, so that's their responsibility. The mother is trying to block access to their belongings, which is a red flag. Legally, once someone moves out, they shouldn't be responsible for the parent's bills. The mother's reaction, including preventing them from taking their stuff, is problematic. The person is trying to take responsibility for their own expenses and is moving out for valid reasons. The mother's anger seems to stem from financial loss and maybe emotional issues. The person isn't in the wrong here; they're making their own choices and aren't responsible for their parent's financial needs. So the answer should be B.\n"
