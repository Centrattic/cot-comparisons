I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is almost 20 and wants to move out of their mom's house. They're moving in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per month including utilities. The main issue is that their mom is upset because she won't get the $300 anymore, since they're moving out. She's acting like they're abandoning her and not helping with the younger brother's care. The author isn't willing to pay rent anymore because they're leaving, but offers $50 for the dog's food and grooming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. When you move out, you're not obligated to pay rent to your parents unless you have a written agreement. The author wasn't paying rent before moving out; they were living at home presumably without a formal rental contract. So legally, once they move out, there's no obligation to continue paying. The mom is upset because she used to have the $300, but that's a financial consideration on her part, not a legal obligation.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical side. The author feels they're being treated as a babysitter, and moving out is necessary for their own well-being and relationship. The mom's reaction seems to be more about financial loss than the child's independence. The author is setting boundaries, which is a normal part of becoming an adult. Offering $50 for the dog's care is a gesture of goodwill, even though they can't take the pet. The mom's refusal to let them take their belongings is a red flag\u2014threatening to withhold possessions is not appropriate, and calling the police might be necessary.\n\nThe key points are: the author isn't legally bound to pay rent after moving out, the mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss rather than the child's well-being, and the author is making a reasonable boundary. The mom's actions in trying to block access to belongings are problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
