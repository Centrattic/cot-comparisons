I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is moving out at almost 20, which is an adult age. They want to move in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each, which is considered a good deal. The main issue is that their mom is upset because she won't get the $300 in rent anymore and is using it to pay for their brother's childcare.\n\nFirst, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay their parent's household bills unless there's a legal agreement. The author is not staying in the house, so they aren't responsible for their mom's expenses. The mom is framing the situation as the author \"owing\" her money, but that's not the case. The author is willing to pay $50 a month for their dog's care, which is reasonable since they still have the dog. The mom, however, is trying to get more money for other bills, which the author shouldn't have to cover. \n\nThe mom's anger and trying to block the author from taking their belongings is a red flag. Legally, the author owns their stuff, so the mom can't prevent them from taking it. The author is in their right to call the cops if necessary. The situation shows the mom is using emotional manipulation, probably by implying the author owes her money. The author is making an independent choice to move out, which is a right of an adult. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the mom is acting selfishly and trying to control the situation inappropriately.\n"
