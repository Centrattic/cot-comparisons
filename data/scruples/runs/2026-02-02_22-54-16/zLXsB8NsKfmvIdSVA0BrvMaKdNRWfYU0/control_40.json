I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each. Their mom is upset because she won't get the $300 anymore and is treating the writer like a babysitter for their brother. The writer offers $50 a month for the dog's care but refuses to pay more. The mom is blocking them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: once you move out, you're not obligated to pay your parents for room and board unless there's a formal agreement. The writer isn't in the wrong legally by refusing to pay rent after moving out. The mom's claim that she can't afford to pay someone else for babysitting is her problem, not the writer's. The writer is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. Offering $50 for the dog is a gesture, but not required. The mom's actions of preventing the writer from taking their stuff are problematic and possibly illegal if it's their property. The writer might need legal help here. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
