I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The person is moving out at almost 20, which is an adult age. They want to move in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 rent including utilities. Their mom is upset because she wants the rent money to help with childcare for their brother.\n\nThe user is asking if it's their fault (AITA) for not paying rent after moving out. The mom is acting like the daughter is still responsible for covering her expenses, which seems like a boundary issue. The daughter is setting boundaries by only offering $50 for the dog's care, which makes sense because the dog is hers. The mom is trying to block the daughter from taking her belongings, which is a red flag. Legally, the daughter owns her stuff and should be able to take it without interference.\n\nThe mom's reaction\u2014being livid and calling the daughter a brat\u2014shows resentment over losing financial support. The daughter isn't obligated to pay rent after moving out. The situation highlights the mom expecting financial support beyond what's reasonable. The daughter's decision to set boundaries is justified. The answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
