I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the story is almost 20 and wants to move out. Their mom is upset because she won't get the $300 rent anymore, which she uses to cover babysitting costs for their brother. The author refuses to pay, even after moving out, because they feel they shouldn't have to support their mom financially anymore.\n\nFirst, the age is important. At almost 20, they're an adult, and in most places, you're responsible for your own finances once you're 18. The mom's argument about not being able to afford childcare isn't the author's responsibility. The author is moving out to have their own life, which is understandable. They also mention that the rent is $300 per person, which is a good deal, but they're not obligated to pay their mom anything after moving out. The part about the dog is a bit confusing. The dog is the author's pet, so they're paying for the dog's care because they still own it. That makes sense. The mom is trying to block the author from taking their belongings, which is a legal issue. The author might need to involve the police here since they own their stuff. So, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay after moving out. Their mom's behavior is problematic, trying to control them financially and physically. The answer should be B.\n"
