I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the author is moving out of their mom's house, and the mom is upset because she loses the $300 rent. The mom was using the author as a babysitter for their brother while she has a FWB, and now she's trying to block the author from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, once the author moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay rent unless there's a lease agreement. The author isn't staying in the house anymore, so the rent payment would naturally stop. The mom's claim about needing the money for bills after the move doesn't hold because the author isn't part of the household anymore.\n\nMoral considerations: The author's main reason for moving out is to escape the mother's expectation of childcare. The mom's behavior seems self-centered, using the child for babysitting without proper compensation or support. The author is trying to establish independence, which is a common and reasonable desire. Offering $50 for the dog's care shows some level of responsibility and consideration, even though they can't take the pet.\n\nThe mom's response is hostile, even to the point of blocking the author from taking their belongings. That's a red flag. Legally, the author can call the police for a civil standby, which supports the idea that the author has rights to their possessions.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their independence, fulfilling their own obligations, and the mom's demands after the move are unreasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
