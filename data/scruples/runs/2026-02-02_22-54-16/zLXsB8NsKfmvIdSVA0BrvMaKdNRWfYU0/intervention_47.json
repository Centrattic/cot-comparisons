I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out.\n\nThe situation is that the author, almost 20, wants to move out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which includes utilities. The main reason they want to leave is that their mom has been treating them like a babysitter since the parents split up. The mom has a friend with benefits she sees multiple times a week, while the author only sees their boyfriend once or twice. The mom got angry because she won't be getting the $300 from the author anymore and can't afford to pay someone else for childcare. The author offered $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wanted more help with her bills. The author declined and now the mom is trying to prevent them from taking their stuff, so they might need to involve the police for a civil standby.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: when someone moves out, they're no longer obligated to pay rent or other household bills unless there's a written agreement. The author offered $50 for the dog, which is reasonable if they still have a responsibility for the pet. But the mom is demanding more money for her bills, which the author isn't responsible for once they leave. The mom's anger seems to be about losing the financial support, not the childcare issue. \n\nEthically, the author is trying to establish independence, which is typical at their age. The mom's reliance on them for childcare isn't fair, especially if it's become a burden. The author isn't required to subsidize the mom's lifestyle after moving out. The mom's reaction of keeping their belongings is wrong because the author owns their stuff. \n\nThe key points are the legal obligation of the author to pay rent once they move out and the mom's overreaction. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay; they have the right to their independence and belongings. The mom's behavior is more concerning, as she might be trying to use the dog as an excuse to keep the money and now is blocking the author from taking their property. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
