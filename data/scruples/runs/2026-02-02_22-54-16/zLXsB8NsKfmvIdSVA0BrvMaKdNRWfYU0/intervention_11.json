I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out, which their mom is upset about because she's used to getting $300 a month. The mom is now refusing to let them take their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent anymore unless there's a contract. Since the person is moving out, they're no longer a tenant, so they don't have to pay. The mom's argument that she can't afford to watch the brother is her problem, not the person's. The person is an adult now, so they have the right to leave and stop financial support.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The mom is being unfair, using the child's belongings as leverage. The person is willing to pay $50 for the dog's expenses, which is reasonable. The mom is demanding more money beyond that, which the person isn't responsible for. The person is taking responsibility for their own bills, which is correct.\n\nThe mom's anger and trying to withhold the person's belongings is inappropriate. The person's right to their possessions is clear, and calling the police for a civil standby is a valid step if needed. The person is standing up for themselves after feeling used, which is understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're choosing to take responsibility for themselves and their own financial commitments, and the mom's actions are wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
