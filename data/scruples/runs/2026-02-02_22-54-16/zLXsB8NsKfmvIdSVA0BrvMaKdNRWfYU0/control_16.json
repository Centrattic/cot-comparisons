I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a young adult moving out, which is a big step towards independence. They're refusing to pay rent to their mom after they leave, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning: they feel their mom has been using them as a babysitter since the parents split. The mom has a significant other and isn't providing the same support the user had before. The user is moving in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per month. The mom is upset because she's losing the $300 and now has to cover the brother's care. The user offers $50 for the dog's expenses, which makes sense since they own the dog but can't take it. The mom wants more money, which the user refuses, leading to the mom blocking them from taking their stuff.\n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a written agreement. The user is buying their own things now, so it's reasonable they don't continue to pay. The mom's behavior\u2014keeping the user's belongings\u2014is problematic. The user might need to involve authorities to retrieve their property, which is their right.\n\nEmotionally, the user is seeking independence and feels used. The mom's reaction seems more about financial loss than the child moving out. The user isn't in the wrong for asserting their autonomy. The mom's refusal to let them take their things is the real issue here. So the answer should be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
