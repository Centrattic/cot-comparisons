I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault for not paying rent after moving out. The scenario is that the person is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. Their mom is upset because she was getting $300 a month in rent from them, which she was using to cover babysitting costs for their brother. The person is not paying anymore and is only offering $50 for the dog's expenses. The mom is now trying to block them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, the person is an adult moving out, which is a normal life step. They're not legally obligated to pay their mom rent once they leave. The $300 was part of a rental agreement, but once they move out, that agreement ends. The mom's anger seems based on losing that income, which is her problem, not the person's. The person is being fair by offering to help with the dog's expenses, which is reasonable. The mom's claim about not being able to afford babysitting is her financial issue, not the person's responsibility. The person is also standing their ground about their own bills, which makes sense. The mom's threat to prevent them from taking their belongings is where she's in the wrong, and the person might need to call the police for assistance, which they have the right to do.\n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re making a responsible decision to move out and aren't obligated to continue supporting their mom financially. The mom's reaction is more about her own financial adjustment, which isn't the person's responsibility. The answer should be B.\n"
