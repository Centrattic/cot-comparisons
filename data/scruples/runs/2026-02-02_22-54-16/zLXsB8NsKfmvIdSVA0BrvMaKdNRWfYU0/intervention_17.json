I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is moving out of their mom's house because their mom has been treating them like a babysitter for their brother since the parents split. The mom is upset because she won't get $300 a month from the author anymore and is now trying to prevent them from taking their stuff. The author is offering $50 for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wants more money for other bills.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is obligated to pay rent after moving out. Legally, when you move out of a family home, especially if you're an adult, you're not required to pay rent unless there's a prior agreement. The author isn't staying in the house anymore, so there's no reason they should continue paying rent. Their mom is acting like it's an obligation, but that's not typical. \n\nThe mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss, which is her issue, not the author's. The author is setting boundaries by not wanting to act as a babysitter. The part about the dog is a bit tricky. The mom is still the owner, so the author offering to pay for the dog's food and grooming is a kind gesture, but not a legal requirement. The mom's trying to block the author from taking their belongings is a red flag. Legally, parents can't prevent their adult children from taking their personal belongings, so the author might be right to involve the police.\n\nThe key points here are the author's autonomy as an adult, the lack of obligation to pay rent post-move, and the mom's overreach in trying to control the situation. The author is making a stand for their independence, which is generally seen as right. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
