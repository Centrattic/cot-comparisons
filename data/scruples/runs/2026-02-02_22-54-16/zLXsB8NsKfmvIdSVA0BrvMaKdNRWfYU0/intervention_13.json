I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation is that the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, and the rent is $300 per person. The mother was upset because she wanted the $300 for bills and taking care of the younger brother. The author is saying they won't pay her anymore once they move out, only giving $50 for the dog's food and grooming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Once someone moves out, they aren't legally obligated to pay their parent's bills unless there's a prior agreement. The mother might be using the child's past contributions as an expectation, but that doesn't hold up once the child is independent. The author is taking responsibility for their own bills now, which makes sense.\n\nEmotionally, the mother is upset because she's relying on the child's financial help. However, the author has their own needs and is moving out for valid reasons, like being treated like a babysitter. The mother's reaction of trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings is problematic and might be legally actionable.\n\nThe author is offering some support for the dog, which shows they're not completely cutting ties. The mother's demand for more money is unreasonable, especially since the author is moving out. The key point is that the author is no longer living under their parent's roof, so financial responsibility shifts to them.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay their mother after moving out. The answer should be B.\n"
