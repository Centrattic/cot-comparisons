I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The person is moving out because their mom has been using them as a babysitter for their brother since the parents' divorce. The mom is upset about losing the $300 rent and is trying to prevent the person from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Once someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The person isn't staying in the house anymore, so they wouldn't be responsible for the rent. They're moving into a place where they have to pay $300 per person, which is a separate living arrangement. \n\nEmotionally, the person feels they've been overworking to take care of the brother, and the mom is now acting as if the child is the person's responsibility. The mom's argument about not being able to afford someone else isn't the person's responsibility once they've moved out. The person is offering $50 for the dog's care, which shows they're trying to help but aren't obligated to pay more than that. \n\nThe mom's reaction of being livid and trying to prevent the person from taking their stuff is problematic. Legally, parents can't prevent their adult child from taking their belongings. The person might need legal intervention here, which supports their stance. \n\nThe person isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after moving out. They have their own bills and responsibilities. The mom's expectations were perhaps unrealistic, expecting rent from someone who's no longer living there. So the answer should be B, the person is not in the wrong.\n"
