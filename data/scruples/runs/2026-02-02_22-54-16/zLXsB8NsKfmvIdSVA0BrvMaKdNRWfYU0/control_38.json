I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The person is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The mom is upset because she used to get $300 a month from them and now they're not paying. The person offered $50 a month for the dog's expenses, but the mom wants more money. She's also trying to prevent them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the person has an obligation to continue paying rent after moving out. Legally, once you move out, you're no longer under a lease agreement, so they aren't responsible for that rent. The mom's argument that she can't afford to pay for the brother's babysitting isn't their responsibility, especially since they've moved out. The person is setting boundaries, which is important for their independence. The mom's actions of trying to block them from taking their belongings are problematic and might even be illegal. The user is probably wondering if they should feel guilty for not paying the mom after leaving. The key points are about financial responsibility post-move and the mother's overreach. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they're within their rights to stop paying rent once they've moved out, and the mother's demands are unreasonable.\n"
