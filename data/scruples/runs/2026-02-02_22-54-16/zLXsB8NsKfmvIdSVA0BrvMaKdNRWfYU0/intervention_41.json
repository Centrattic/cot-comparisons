I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario is that the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person including utilities. The mother is upset because she won't get the rent money anymore and is treating the person like a babysitter for their brother after the parents split. The person is offering $50 a month for the dog but not more, and the mom is trying to block them from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The person is moving into their own place, so they shouldn't have to pay their mom rent. The mom might be treating them as a roommate, but once they leave, the responsibility ends. The $50 for the dog seems reasonable since they mention they can't take the pet, so they're still helping with that.\n\nThe emotional aspect: The person feels they're being used as a babysitter. The mom's reaction is about losing income, which might be a point of contention. However, the person's right to leave and manage their own finances is important. The mom's actions in trying to prevent them from taking their stuff are problematic. Legally, the person owns their belongings and can call the police if needed. The mother's anger and the demand for more money might stem from financial stress, but the person isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries.\n\nAlso, the situation mentions that the mother has a friend with benefits and expects the person to cover childcare. The person is trying to establish independence, which is valid. The refusal to pay beyond the dog's expenses is justified as they have their own bills now. The mother's threat to block belongings is a legal issue, and the person is right to consider involving authorities if necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their independence and managing their responsibilities post-move. The mother's actions are more in the wrong here. So the answer should be B.\n"
