I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is moving out at almost 20, which is technically an adult. They're moving in with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per person including utilities. Their mom is upset because she was getting $300 a month from them as rent. After the parents split up, the mom expects the person to help with their brother, acting as a live-in babysitter. The mom is now angry because she can't afford to pay someone else for childcare. The person offered $50 a month for the dog's needs but refuses to pay more. The mom is trying to prevent them from taking their belongings, so they might have to involve the police.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once someone moves out, they are not obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement in place. Since the author is moving out, it's reasonable they don't have to pay rent anymore. The mom's expectation that the adult child should continue paying rent after moving out isn't typical. Parents might expect help when children are minors, but once the child is an adult, they're generally not required to support parents financially unless there's a written agreement, which seems unlikely here.\n\nEmotionally, the mom is treating the author as a babysitter, which might not be fair. The author is trying to establish independence, which is a normal part of becoming an adult. The mom's anger and attempts to block the person from taking their belongings could be a legal issue. In terms of property rights, the person owns their belongings and can retrieve them, possibly needing police intervention if the mom is preventing access.\n\nThe author's offer to pay for the dog's care is a gesture, but they aren't required to do that either. The mom's demand for more money beyond that is unreasonable. The key points are the adult child's right to independence and the lack of legal obligation to support parents financially once they move out.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
