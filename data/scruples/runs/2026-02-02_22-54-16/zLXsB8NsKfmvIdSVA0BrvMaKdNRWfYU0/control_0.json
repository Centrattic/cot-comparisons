I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves a young adult moving out, and the mother is upset because she's losing the $300 rent. The author is being accused of being ungrateful and not helping with the family's financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone moves out, they are no longer obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement in place. The parent might have been using the rent to help with family expenses, but that's not a legal requirement. The author is within their rights to stop paying once they're no longer living in the house.\n\nThen there's the emotional and familial angle. The mother is upset because she's adjusting to the child moving out, which is a normal part of a child becoming independent. However, the mother's behavior of calling the author an ungrateful brat and trying to block them from taking their belongings is problematic. It's not the author's responsibility to continue financially supporting the family once they've left.\n\nThe author is offering to pay $50 a month for the dog's care, which shows some level of consideration. The mother's demand for more money beyond that seems excessive, especially since the author has their own bills. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. The mother should have anticipated the financial change when the child decided to move out.\n\nAlso, the parent's reaction of being livid and trying to prevent the author from taking their belongings is a red flag. It's possible that the mother may have legal standing to block the removal of property if it's still in her possession, but the author might need to involve authorities to resolve that. However, that doesn't directly relate to whether the author is at fault for refusing rent.\n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong. They are exercising their right to independence, and the mother's resistance seems more about her own financial adjustment than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
