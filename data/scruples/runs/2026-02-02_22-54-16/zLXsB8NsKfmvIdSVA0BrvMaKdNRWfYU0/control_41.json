I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario is that the person is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 each including utilities. The mother is upset because she was getting that money and now expects to pay for the brother's care. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and moral aspects here. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. But in this case, the person is moving out, so the rent was part of living under the parent's roof. Once they leave, the obligation to pay rent stops unless they agreed otherwise.\n\nMoral considerations: The person feels they were being used as a babysitter after the parents split. They want independence and are setting boundaries. The mother is upset about losing the financial support, which seems more about her own convenience than fairness. The mother's actions of trying to prevent the person from taking their belongings are problematic. Legally, the person owns their stuff and can't be prevented from taking it. Calling the cops for a civil standby is a valid step if the mother is blocking access.\n\nThe person is cutting financial ties, which is reasonable as they're moving out. The mother's demands for more money after moving out aren't justified. The person is even offering $50 for the dog's expenses, which is a gesture of goodwill. The mother's reaction and trying to withhold belongings is more about control than fairness.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their independence and not continuing financial obligations after moving out. The mother's actions are the issue here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
