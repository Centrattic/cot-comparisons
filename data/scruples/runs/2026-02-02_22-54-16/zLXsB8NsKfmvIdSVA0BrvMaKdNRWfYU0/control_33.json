I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is almost 20 and moving out with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, including utilities. They want to leave mainly because their mom has been treating them like a live-in babysitter since the parents split up. The mom is upset not just because of the loss of their help, but specifically because she won't get the $300 a month from them anymore. The person offers $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wants more to help with her bills. She's now trying to block them from taking their stuff, leading the person to consider calling the cops for a civil standby.\n\nThe core issue here is whether the person is obligated to continue paying rent or helping financially after moving out. Legally, once you move out, you're no longer responsible for the landlord's rent unless you have a specific agreement. Since the person is moving out, they're not a tenant anymore, so they don't owe rent. The mom might have considered the $300 as part of their contribution to household expenses, especially if they were staying in her house, but that's different from formal rent. If the arrangement was an informal understanding where they were helping out in exchange for room and board, but the person is moving out, they\u2019re not obligated to continue paying once they leave. \n\nThe mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss rather than the lack of babysitting help. The person is offering to cover the dog's specific expenses, which is reasonable. The mom's demand for more money to help with other bills isn't their responsibility unless there's an agreement. The person is also facing unreasonable behavior from their mom, like blocking access to their belongings. This is where legal action (civil standby) might be necessary to protect their rights. \n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong because they're no longer living in the house and thus not responsible for the rent. They\u2019re also not obligated to support their mom's other bills unless they agreed to. The mom's reaction is more about her feelings of betrayal due to the financial aspect, but the person has the right to move out and manage their own finances. The answer should be B (No).\n"
