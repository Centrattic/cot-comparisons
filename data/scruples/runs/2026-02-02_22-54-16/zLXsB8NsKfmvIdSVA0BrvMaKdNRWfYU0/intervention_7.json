I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for not paying rent after moving out. The writer is almost 20, moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, including utilities. The main issue is that the mom was upset because she wouldn't get $300 a month from the kid anymore, as she's been using the kid as a babysitter since the parents split. The kid offered $50 a month for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wanted more. Now the mom is trying to prevent the kid from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, once someone moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a prior agreement. The kid is moving into their own place, so they're not living under the parent's roof anymore. The mom is acting as if the kid is still a tenant, but moving out typically ends that arrangement. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss, not the child's need for independence.\n\nEthically, the kid's situation shows they're trying to be fair by offering some money for the dog, acknowledging the dog is still theirs. The mom's behavior\u2014calling the kid names and trying to block them from taking their belongings\u2014is extreme. It's about the mom's adjustment to losing a financial source, not the kid's responsibility. The kid isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after moving out. They've addressed the dog's care with an offer, which shows consideration. The mom's actions are more concerning here. So the answer is B.\n"
