I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario involves moving out, financial responsibilities, and family dynamics.\n\nFirst, the person is almost 20 and moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends. The rent is $300 per person, which seems reasonable. The parent is upset because they won't get that $300 anymore. The parent had been relying on the child to babysit after the parents split up. The parent is now trying to block the child from taking their belongings, which is a red flag. \n\nLegally, once someone moves out, they're not obligated to pay rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The parent's threat to prevent the child from taking their stuff is probably illegal. The child is standing up for their independence, which is understandable. The parent's behavior seems manipulative and abusive, using money and custody of the child's belongings as leverage. \n\nThe key points here are the parent's reaction, the child's right to their belongings, and the fact that the child is choosing to pay for the dog's care as a gesture, but the parent is unreasonable in asking for more. The parent's anger and blocking the child from their things is definitely in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're asserting their independence and the parent is acting unreasonably. Also, the parent's actions of trying to prevent the child from taking their belongings are wrong.\n"
