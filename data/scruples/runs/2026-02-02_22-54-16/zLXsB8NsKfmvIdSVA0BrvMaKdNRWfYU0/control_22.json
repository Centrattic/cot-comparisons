I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The scenario is that the person is about to move out of their mom's house and into a place with a boyfriend and friends. The rent there is $300 per person, including utilities. The main issue is that the mom is upset because she's losing the $300 from the kid's rent, as she's been using that money to cover babysitting for the younger brother. The kid feels they've been treated as a live-in babysitter since the parents split, and they want to move out to have their own life. They offered $50 for the dog's expenses, but the mom wanted more, and now is trying to block them from taking their stuff.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. Legally, when someone moves out, they aren't obligated to continue paying rent to their parents unless there's a specific agreement. The mom is trying to use the $300 as a form of payment for the babysitting, but that's not a formal arrangement. The kid is an adult now (almost 20), so they're responsible for their own choices. The mom's reaction seems to be about losing the financial benefit rather than the babysitting itself. The kid is standing up for their independence, which is understandable. The mom's actions of trying to prevent the kid from taking their belongings are problematic and possibly illegal, as belongings belong to the owner regardless of living arrangements.\n\nEthically, the kid is making a decision to prioritize their own life and well-being. The mom's situation with the younger brother is her responsibility now that the kid is moving out. The $50 offer for the dog is reasonable, but the mom is greedy by asking for more. The kid isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The mom's anger and trying to block the move are her issues, not the kid's. So the answer here should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
