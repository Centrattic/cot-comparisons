I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The situation involves the person moving out at almost 20, wanting to live with their boyfriend and friends. Their mom is upset because she loses the $300 rent and feels they're abandoning her after the parents' divorce, where the mom relies on the kid for babysitting their brother. The mom is now trying to block the person from taking their belongings.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author has a legal or moral obligation to pay rent after moving out. Legally, once someone moves out, they typically aren't responsible for the landlord's rent unless there's a lease agreement or specific terms. The author is moving out of their mom's house, so maybe the mom isn't the landlord but the parent. The user mentions paying $50 for the dog's food and grooming, which could be seen as a gesture, but not rent. \n\nThe mom's anger stems from financial loss and feeling that the child is abandoning her. However, once the person moves out, it's reasonable for them to not support their parent financially unless there's a prior agreement. The mom's actions\u2014blocking the child from taking their belongings\u2014are problematic and possibly illegal, which might justify the user's intention to call the cops. \n\nThe key points are the user's right to leave, the lack of obligation to pay beyond what was agreed upon, and the mom's overreach in trying to prevent the child from taking their possessions. The user's refusal to pay the mom's bills is a personal choice, and given the context, it's understandable. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong), considering the user's autonomy and the mom's unrealistic expectations.\n"
