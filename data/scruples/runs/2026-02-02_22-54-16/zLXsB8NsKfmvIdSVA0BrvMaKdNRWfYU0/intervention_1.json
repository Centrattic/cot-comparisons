I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is moving out to live with their boyfriend and friends, paying $300 per month including utilities. The main issue is that the mother is upset because she loses the $300 she was getting as \"rent,\" which she was using to cover childcare for the author's brother. The author isn't taking the dog, so they offered $50 a month for dog-related expenses.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: Once someone moves out, they're generally not obligated to pay their parents for living expenses unless there's a formal agreement. The author isn't a minor anymore, almost 20, so they have the right to live independently. The $300 was likely an informal arrangement, not a legal contract. The mother can't legally force the author to pay her after moving out.\n\nEmotionally, the mother is using the brother's care as a reason to keep the author, but that's not the author's responsibility. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The mother's reaction (being livid, trying to block the author from taking belongings) is inappropriate and possibly illegal if it's interference with the author's property.\n\nThe author is offering to pay for the dog's care, which shows some consideration, even though they can't take the dog. Refusing to cover other bills is justified as the author has their own expenses.\n\nThe mother's attempt to prevent the author from taking their stuff is a red flag. The author might need legal help to reclaim their property, which the cops can assist with in a civil standby. The mother's behavior crosses into controlling territory, which isn't the author's fault.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their independence, and the mother's actions are the issue here.\n"
