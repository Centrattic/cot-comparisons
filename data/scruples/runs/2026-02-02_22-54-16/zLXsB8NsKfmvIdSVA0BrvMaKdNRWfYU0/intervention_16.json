I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I\u2019m lucky. So I\u2019ve informed my mom that I\u2019ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won\u2019t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can\u2019t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that\u2019s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can\u2019t take her with me as pets aren\u2019t allowed, unless it\u2019s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to \u201chelp pay other bills\u201d and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to pay rent after moving out. The author is almost 20, moving in with a boyfriend and friends where rent is $300 per person including utilities. They mention their mom treating them like a live-in babysitter since the parents split up. The mom is upset because she loses the $300 and can't afford to pay someone else to watch the brother. The author offers $50 for the dog's food and grooming, but the mom wants more money and is now blocking them from taking their stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is moving out, which is a natural step towards independence. The mom's anger seems to stem from financial loss rather than the child's well-being. The author is offering some financial help for the dog, which is reasonable, especially if they can't take the dog with them. The mom's demand for more money beyond the dog's care and the act of withholding the author's belongings are problematic. \n\nLegally, once the author moves out, they aren't obligated to pay rent unless they have a lease or agreement. The mother can't legally prevent them from taking their property. The emotional aspect is the mom treating the child as a financial resource instead of a person seeking independence. The author's refusal to continue paying rent after moving out is justified because they are no longer living there. The $50 offer is a gesture of goodwill, but the mother's insistence on more is where the issue lies. The main conflict is about the mother's expectations versus the author's right to independence. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong here. The mom's actions are more about her own financial situation and not respecting the child's autonomy.\n"
