      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child that might go blind due to a hereditary condition. The condition is Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects the men in the family. The author is a man, so if they have a son, there's a 50% chance the kid will inherit it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The author is concerned about the quality of life for a potential child. They mention that the father in the family went blind, leading to no job, no social life, etc. The author is worried about subjecting a child to that. \n\nNow, is it wrong to not want to have a child who might face such a severe condition? There's a debate here. On one hand, some might argue that it's selfish to not have a child to avoid potential suffering. On the other hand, others might say that it's a responsible decision to prevent the child from enduring a painful or limiting condition. \n\nThe author also clarifies they don't want to offend anyone living with a disability. They're not dismissing the value of life for those with disabilities but are making a personal choice about reproduction. \n\nFrom a medical ethics perspective, there's the principle of non-maleficence\u2014do no harm. If there's a high chance of a child being born into a condition that significantly harms their quality of life, choosing not to have the child could be seen as ethically sound. However, some might argue that life has intrinsic value, and the parents should not make that decision for the child. \n\nBut then, parents often make decisions that they believe are in the best interest of their children. For example, not having a child if there's a risk of a severe genetic disorder. It's a personal choice that involves weighing the potential suffering against the benefits of raising a child. \n\nThe key here is that the author is not discriminating against people with disabilities but is making a difficult decision based on the potential future of their child. They\u2019re considering the child\u2019s well-being and their own ability to provide a good life. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's decision is a personal one, and they're not necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
