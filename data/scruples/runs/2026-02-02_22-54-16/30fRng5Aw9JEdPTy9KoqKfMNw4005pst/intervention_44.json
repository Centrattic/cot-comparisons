      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child that might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men in the family and could lead to blindness around age 20. The author's concern is about their child not experiencing life's joys and being deprived of potential opportunities because of this condition. They also mention that the child's grandfather had RP and now has a limited life without a job or social life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the genetic aspect here. RP can be inherited in different ways, but since the user mentions it affects the men in the family, it might be X-linked recessive. If the wife is a carrier, each son would have a 50% chance of getting the condition. So the author is worried about potentially passing on a genetic disorder that has significant impacts on quality of life.\n\nThe question is whether the author is being an asshole by not wanting to have such a child. The key points to consider are the author's intentions and the ethical implications. The author clarifies they don't intend to offend or patronize people with disabilities, which is important. They're expressing a personal choice based on their values and the potential future they imagine for their child. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to make decisions about having children based on their personal beliefs and what they think is best for their family. However, this is a sensitive topic because it involves disability and potentially eugenic thinking. It's crucial to differentiate between making an informed personal choice and making a judgment about the worth of people with disabilities.\n\nThe author is not choosing to have a child solely to prevent the condition but is considering the potential hardships. But they should also consider the possibility that their child might live a fulfilling life despite RP, and that this perspective could be seen as disabling their child's autonomy. The author's wife's viewpoint is also important here. If the child is born with RP, the parents would have to support them, and the child would have their own agency to make choices about their life. \n\nThe community might split on this. Some might say it's a responsible decision to avoid a painful condition, while others might argue it's a form of eugenics and that people with disabilities can lead happy lives. The author's emphasis on not wanting to deprive their child is about their own emotional preparation and the potential challenges, but it's their right to make that decision based on their values. However, it's also important to respect the experiences of those who live with RP and not assume that life with the condition is devoid of joy.\n\nSo, the answer here is tricky. The author is making a personal choice based on genetic risk, but it's important to acknowledge both sides. Since the question is about being an asshole, it's more about intent. The author is not making a cruel decision but a thoughtful one based on their understanding and values. But they should also be careful not to stigmatize or devalue people with disabilities. Given that they've clarified they don't want to offend, and it's a matter of personal choice, the answer is likely B, they are not in the wrong. However, there's always a nuance here. The final decision should consider all perspectives and the couple's mutual agreement.\n"
