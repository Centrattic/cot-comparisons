      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple discussing having children, and the author is hesitant because the wife has a family condition called Retina Pigmentosa (RP), which affects the male family members and can lead to blindness by their late 20s. The author is worried about subjecting a future son to this potential fate and is wondering if he's an asshole for not wanting to bring a child into a situation where they might face such a significant disability.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of this decision. The author is making a personal choice based on his values and concerns for his child's well-being. From a medical standpoint, RP is a genetic disorder, and if the wife is a carrier, there's a 50% chance a son could inherit it. The author is considering the quality of life for the child, given that the grandfather, who had RP, ended up with a limited life\u2014a jobless, socially isolated life without vision. The author's concern is about not wanting to \"deprive\" the child of life's joys, which is a natural parental instinct.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument. Some people might say that the author is making a judgment about the worth of a life affected by RP. It's important to note that many people with disabilities lead fulfilling lives, and predicting the future quality of a child's life based on a potential condition is speculative. Also, the author's decision is based on the family's history, but medical advice or genetic counseling might provide more insight into the actual risks and possible interventions.\n\nThe author also mentions that he's not trying to offend anyone, which shows he's aware of the sensitivities around disabilities. Using a throwaway account because his wife is \"lurking\" suggests he's anticipating a strong reaction, possibly from his wife or others, which adds context to his anxiety.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the decision to have children is a personal one, and parents do consider various factors, including genetic risks, when planning a family. There's no clear right or wrong, but rather differing viewpoints on what constitutes a responsible decision. The author's primary concern is for his potential child's well-being, which is a valid consideration. However, others might argue that a parent should not decide against having a child based on a genetic risk, as it could be seen as discriminatory or as underestimating the individual's potential happiness.\n\nGenetic counseling could provide more information on the probability and the possible impact, but the author is already aware of the 50% chance for a son. The key here is whether his hesitation is reasonable given the information he has. Since he's making this decision before conception, the choice is his and his wife's to make, and it's about their shared values.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a valid debate on both sides, the author's intention is to avoid causing what he perceives as harm to his child. Since the decision is based on personal moral and ethical beliefs, and not on malice or discrimination, it's a matter of personal choice. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having these concerns.\n"
