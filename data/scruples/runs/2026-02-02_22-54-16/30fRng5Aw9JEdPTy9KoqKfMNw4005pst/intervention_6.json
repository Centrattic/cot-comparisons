      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's start by understanding the scenario. The author and their wife are discussing having kids, and there's a genetic condition in her family called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he might go blind in his late 20s. The author is expressing concern about not wanting to put their child through that kind of life, referencing the grandfather who's blind and how it's affected his life. The question is, is the author an asshole for not wanting to have a child under these circumstances?\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a decision based on their perception of what's best for the child's future. They're worried about the quality of life the child would have, given the potential for blindness. But is it their place to make that decision for the child? On one hand, parents often make choices to protect their children from suffering. On the other hand, some might argue that deciding not to have a child with a disability is a form of discrimination, or that the child could lead a fulfilling life despite the condition.\n\nI should also think about the nature of the condition. RP is a degenerative disease that leads to blindness. The author mentions that the grandfather lost his vision and consequently has no job or social life. That's a significant impact. The author is concerned about the child missing out on the \"joys of life,\" but maybe they're not considering the possibility that the child could still have a good life with support, or that there are ways to live successfully with visual impairments. Also, the condition might not be as severe in every case\u2014it's a 50% chance, not a certainty.\n\nAnother angle is the author's intention. They clarify they don't mean to be offensive or patronizing towards people with disabilities. They're making a personal choice based on their values and what they think is best. However, people might argue that by choosing not to have a child with this condition, they're implying that a life with such a disability isn't worth having, which could be seen as ableist.\n\nBut the author is also considering the future care and challenges. If the child becomes blind in his 20s, the parents would have to support him until then, and later he'd need to navigate adulthood with that condition. The author might be thinking about the burden on the family and the child's own struggles. However, it's important to note that people with disabilities often lead independent lives with the right support and resources. Maybe the author is overestimating the negative impact or underestimating the adaptability of the child.\n\nThe mention that this is a throwaway account because the wife is lurking suggests there's some tension or disagreement between them. The author might be seeking validation for their stance. The question is whether their stance is justified.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing emphasis on not judging others' parenting choices, especially when it comes to genetic conditions. However, there's also a debate around the ethics of bringing a child into the world with a known risk of disability. The author's position is that they don't want to subject their child to a life of potential blindness, but others might see it as a valid personal choice. \n\nI should also consider the possibility that the author isn't fully informed about the condition. For example, RP might not completely remove vision but significantly reduce it, allowing the person to still function. Or there could be advancements in treatment by the time the child is an adult. The author's knowledge is based on their grandfather's experience, but medical science can change.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision is based on their perception of the child's quality of life. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether their reasoning is considered selfish or protective. The key factors are the author's intentions, the accuracy of their understanding of the condition, and societal views on disability. If the author is making an informed choice without prejudice, they might not be in the wrong. However, if their views are based on stereotypes or a lack of understanding, others might argue they are.\n"
