      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole for not wanting to have a child who might develop a condition causing blindness in their 20s. The condition, retinitis pigmentosa, affects males in the wife's family with a 50% chance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The author is concerned about their child's quality of life, specifically the potential loss of sight and its impact on their life. They mention not wanting the child to miss out on \"joys of life,\" using examples like the grandfather who became blind and couldn't work or socialize. But they clarify they don't intend to be offensive to those with disabilities.\n\nOn one hand, parents often make decisions based on their child's well-being. If there's a significant risk of a severe condition, it's reasonable to weigh the pros and cons of having a child. On the other hand, some might argue that not wanting to have a child with a disability could be seen as discriminatory or not accepting people with disabilities. However, the author doesn't seem to be making a judgment about those already living with the condition; they're making a personal choice about their own family planning.\n\nThe key here is that the author is making a personal decision based on their values and what they believe is best for their potential child. As long as they're not being discriminatory or derogatory, this seems to be a valid personal choice. The post also mentions that this isn't meant to offend, so the intent is important. People have the right to make decisions about having children, especially considering genetic risks. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
