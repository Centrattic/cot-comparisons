      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have a child who might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa, which could lead to blindness in their 20s. The author is asking if they're an asshole for not wanting to subject their child to this fate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical aspect. The wife's family has this condition, which affects males. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he could go blind. The author is concerned about the quality of life for such a child, citing the grandfather's example of being blind, unable to work, and having no social life. The author doesn't want their child to miss out on life's joys. They also mention not being dismissive of disabilities.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's think about this. Parental choice and medical ethics are involved here. People have the right to make decisions about their reproductive choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their potential child. The author isn't making a value judgment on the lives of disabled people but is considering the potential hardships. \n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that it's not up to parents to decide someone else's quality of life. Some might view this as eugenic thinking, even if unintentional. But the author is being honest about their feelings. Also, the author clarifies they don't want to offend anyone. The grandfather's example shows the potential challenges the child might face, which the author is trying to avoid. The decision is personal and based on their assessment of what's best for a future child.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, society often respects individual choices regarding family planning, especially when it's informed and compassionate. The author isn't dismissing the value of life with a disability but is considering the possible negative aspects. So, the answer is likely B (no), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
