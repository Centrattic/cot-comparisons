      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop retinitis pigmentosa. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and his wife are considering having a child. The wife has a family condition where the men in her family get this eye condition that leads to blindness by their late 20s. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could inherit it. The author is saying he doesn't want to bring a child into the world who might face such a severe disability, leading to a life without the ability to see their kids, work, socialize, etc. He's asking if he's the asshole for not wanting that for his child.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects of procreating when there's a risk of passing on a genetic disorder. There's a balance between the right to have children and the responsibility to prevent unnecessary suffering. If there's a significant risk of a debilitating condition, is it ethical to have a child with that risk?\n\nOn one hand, the parents want to avoid causing their child pain and hardship. On the other, others might argue that life's value isn't diminished by disability, and that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives. Also, the decision not to have a child based on potential disability could be seen as discriminatory, implying that a life with disability isn't worth living.\n\nBut in this case, the condition leads to blindness by the late 20s, which is a severe impairment. The author is not dismissing the value of life for people with disabilities; he's expressing concern about the quality of life for his potential child. He even mentions that he doesn't want to \"deprive\" his child of life's joys, indicating he's considering the child's well-being.\n\nAnother angle is the genetic risk. If the condition only affects males and the wife is a carrier, then male children have a 50% chance. If they have a daughter, the risk might be different, but since the question is about the author's stance, maybe they're considering gender. But the author is specifically worried about sons, so they might be considering not having sons or using technologies like IVF with genetic screening.\n\nThe author is also using a throwaway account because his wife is \"lurking,\" which suggests there's tension in their relationship over this issue. That personal detail might influence how the situation is viewed, but ethically, the focus should be on the decision-making process.\n\nI should also consider that the author is not making a value judgment against people with disabilities; he's making a personal choice based on his family's circumstances. His concern is about the child's potential suffering, not the worth of those who already live with the condition.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that it's a personal choice to have children and that the author is trying to prevent a difficult life for his child. Others might argue that he's assuming he knows what the child would want, which is speculative. However, given the severity of the condition leading to blindness and its impact on independence and life experiences, the author's stance could be seen as a responsible decision to avoid unnecessary suffering.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a difficult decision based on his understanding of the risks and his desire to protect his future child. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
