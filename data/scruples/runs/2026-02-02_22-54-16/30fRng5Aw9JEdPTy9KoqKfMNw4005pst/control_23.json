      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop retinitis pigmentosa, a condition that can lead to blindness in their late 20s. The author argues that they don't want their son to suffer from the same fate as his grandfather, who lost his sight and is now unemployed and socially isolated. They also mention that the condition affects men in the family, giving a 50% chance for a son to inherit it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is making a decision based on the potential suffering of their child. They're concerned about the child's quality of life and the hardships associated with the condition. On one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their family's health history. On the other hand, some might argue that this is a form of ableism, as it's avoiding a child with a disability. But the author clarifies that they aren't trying to be offensive.\n\nNext, the condition in question is retinitis pigmentosa. It's a genetic disorder that leads to progressive vision loss. The father is worried about his son's future. The grandfather's example is used to highlight the potential consequences. The author is weighing their desire to have a child against the potential suffering. They mention that they don't want to deprive the child of life's joys, which is a common parental concern.\n\nThe question here is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to put their child at risk. It's important to note that reproductive choice includes the decision to avoid passing on hereditary conditions. However, some might argue that this is a personal choice and not morally wrong. Others might see it as a responsible decision to prevent future suffering. The author also preemptively apologizes for not being offensive, which shows they're aware of the sensitivity.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a spectrum. Some cultures or communities might view this as a necessary precaution, while others might see it as discriminatory. The key point is that the author isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities but is considering their child's future well-being. They're not choosing to terminate a pregnancy based on the condition but are deciding against having a child because of the genetic risk.\n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether avoiding a child with a known hereditary condition is considered wrong. Since the author is making an informed choice to prevent potential suffering, many would argue they're not in the wrong. However, this is a nuanced issue with valid arguments on both sides. The final judgment would depend on the values and perspectives of the person evaluating it, but based on the information given, the author's concerns are reasonable and their decision isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
