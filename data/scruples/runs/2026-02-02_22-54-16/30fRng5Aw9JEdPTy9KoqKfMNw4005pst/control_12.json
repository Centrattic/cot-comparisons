      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is considering not having a child because of a genetic condition that could lead the child (specifically a son) to go blind in their 20s. The question is if the author is the asshole for not wanting to put their child through that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's wife has a family history of Retinita Pigmentosa, which affects men. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he might go blind. The author is concerned about the child's quality of life and not wanting to deprive them of life's joys, citing the example of his father-in-law who is blind, unemployed, and has no social life. The author emphasizes they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities.\n\nNow, the key points here are about making a personal choice regarding having a child based on potential health risks. In many ethical discussions, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their future children. The author isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities but is considering the potential hardships their child might face. They also clarify they don't want to offend, which shows some sensitivity.\n\nHowever, others might argue that deciding not to have a child based on a genetic condition could be seen as ableism, or as making a judgment about the value of life with disabilities. But in this case, the condition isn't certain\u2014it's a 50% chance for sons. The author is weighing the potential suffering against bringing a child into the world. \n\nI should consider legal and ethical standards. In most places, individuals have the right to make decisions about reproduction, including using genetic information. The author isn't being discriminatory towards existing people with the condition but is considering future possibilities. The key here is the author's intention: they're trying to avoid a scenario they perceive as harmful. \n\nAnother angle is the father-in-law's life example. If the author is using that as a reason, maybe there's a consideration of the child's future well-being. But it's also possible that the father-in-law's situation is influenced by other factors beyond just his blindness. However, the author is making a choice based on the information they have.\n\nThe author is also using a throwaway account because the wife is lurking, which might indicate they're concerned about the wife's reaction, but that's probably not relevant to whether they're in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is making a personal decision based on their understanding of potential risks. Unless there's a legal or ethical obligation to have children regardless, their choice isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
