      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retina Pigmentosa, which can lead to blindness in their 20s. The author is concerned about their child's quality of life if they inherit the condition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal choice based on potential future suffering of their child. They mention not wanting to \"deprive\" the child of life's joys. That seems like a common concern when deciding about genetics and parenthood. \n\nRetina Pigmentosa is a genetic disorder with a 50% chance for male children. The author's wife's family history is involved. The author isn't dismissing the condition but is worried about the child's future. They also clarify that they don't mean to offend anyone living with disabilities, which is important.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). In many cultures, people have the right to make reproductive choices, including considering genetic risks. However, some might argue that it's wrong to avoid having a child due to potential disabilities, as it could be seen as discriminatory. Others might support the decision as responsible planning for the child's well-being.\n\nThe author isn't choosing between their child's health and their own desires; they're weighing the child's future quality of life. There's no indication of ableism here, as they acknowledge the condition's impact but express concern for the child's benefit. \n\nConsidering all that, the author is making a personal choice based on their understanding of the child's potential suffering. Unless there's a legal or ethical violation, it's a subjective decision. Therefore, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
