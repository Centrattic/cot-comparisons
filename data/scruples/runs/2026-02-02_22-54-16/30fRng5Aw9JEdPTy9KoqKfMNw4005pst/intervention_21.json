      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have a kid who might develop Retina Pigmentosa, which affects men and leads to blindness in their 20s. The author is concerned about the child's quality of life and doesn't want to subject them to such a condition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. Retina Pigmentosa is a genetic disorder, and if the wife has a family history where it affects the male offspring with a 50% chance, that's a significant risk. The author is being proactive about avoiding passing on a potentially debilitating condition. From an ethical standpoint, parents often make decisions to protect their children's future well-being. \n\nBut then, there's the argument about eugenics or playing God. Some might say that it's not up to parents to decide whether someone with a disability should exist. However, the author isn't making that choice for others; they're making a personal decision not to have a child if it's a high risk. They also mention not wanting to deprive the child of life's joys, which is a common parental concern.\n\nThe author also clarifies they don't intend to offend those living with disabilities, which shows sensitivity. Using a throwaway account because the wife is lurking suggests they're trying to keep the discussion private and aren't trying to provoke a public debate.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people have different thresholds for risk and disability. Some might argue that life's challenges can be overcome with support, but the author is focusing on a specific, severe outcome. It's a personal choice, and unless there's a legal obligation or coercion, it's hard to say they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is making a responsible decision based on their values and the information they have. They aren't harming anyone by choosing not to have a child with a high risk of a serious condition. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
