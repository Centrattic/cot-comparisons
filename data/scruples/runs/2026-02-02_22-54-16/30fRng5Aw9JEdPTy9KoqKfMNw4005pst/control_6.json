      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted about not wanting to have a child that might go blind is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife has a family condition called Retina Pigmentosa, which affects men in the family. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance the child could go blind by late 20s. The author is reluctant because they don't want to deprive their child of life's joys, referencing the grandfather's experience of blindness, unemployment, and lack of social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author isn't trying to be offensive towards people with disabilities; they clarify that. Their concern is about the quality of life for their potential child. But is this a valid reason to not have a child? \n\nFrom a medical genetics standpoint, the condition is inherited, so they're aware of the risks. The decision to have children involves weighing these risks. It's a personal choice, and many people would agree that parents have the right to make decisions to protect their child's well-being. However, some might argue that it's discriminatory to not have a child based on a potential disability, even if that disability carries significant challenges.\n\nThe grandfather's experience is cited as an example of what the child might face. The author is concerned about a life without sight leading to a lack of opportunities. But does that mean it's wrong to bring a child into the world with such a condition? Or is it about the parents' responsibility to consider their child's future?\n\nAlso, the author mentions they're not trying to offend, which is important. The key point is that they're making a personal choice based on their values. However, others might argue that with proper support and technology, a person with such a disability can lead a fulfilling life. But the author's intention is to avoid what they see as a life of deprivation.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, the \"am I the asshole\" angle often reflects on the community's perspective. But in this case, the author is making a decision that they believe is in the best interest of their child, even if it's a difficult one. It's a complex issue with valid points on both sides.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a personal choice based on their understanding of their child's potential future. However, it's also important to acknowledge that some might view this as a form of ableism, though the author's intent isn't to be dismissive of disability.\n"
