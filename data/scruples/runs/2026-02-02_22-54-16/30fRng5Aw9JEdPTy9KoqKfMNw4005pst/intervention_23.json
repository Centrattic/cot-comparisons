      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to have a kid who might go blind in their 20s due to a hereditary condition. Their wife's family has Retina Pigmentosa, which affects males. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he'll go blind by his late 20s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical considerations here. The author is concerned about their child's quality of life. They mention that their father-in-law is blind and hasn't been able to work or socialize. The author is worried about subjecting a child to a similar fate. They clarify they don't want to be offensive towards people with disabilities.\n\nNow, the key points are: the author is making a personal choice about having children based on potential genetic risks. The question is whether this choice makes them an asshole. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to make decisions about their reproductive choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their potential children. However, some might argue that this is a form of ableism, where the author is devaluing the life of someone with a disability. But others might say that avoiding unnecessary suffering is a valid concern.\n\nThe author also mentions they don't mean to offend and are clear about their intentions. The use of a throwaway account suggests they're concerned about privacy or their wife's reaction, but that's not directly relevant to whether they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's a complex issue. The author's decision isn't straightforwardly right or wrong. However, since they are making a personal choice based on their values without intent to harm, the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong.\n"
