      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which can lead to blindness in their 20s. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical aspect. The wife has a family condition that affects males, with a 50% chance of passing it to their son. If they have a boy, he could go blind by 20. The father is worried about the child's quality of life, using the example of his father-in-law who is blind, unemployed, and has no social life. The author is concerned about depriving the child of these experiences.\n\nNow, the ethical question here is about whether it's wrong not to have a child to avoid a hereditary condition that could lead to blindness. There's a lot of nuance here. On one hand, parents have a responsibility to consider the well-being of their children. On the other hand, people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives, and it's not always appropriate to assume a life without certain experiences is worse.\n\nI should recall that the Trolley Problem analogy isn't directly applicable here, but similar ethical reasoning about preventing harm might be. The father is making a choice based on his perception of his child's future quality of life. However, there's a risk in making assumptions about what a person with a disability would value. For example, some people with RP might adapt and find ways to have a rich life, and their perspective on their condition could differ from others.\n\nAlso, the post mentions that they are just discussing having kids and the author is hesitant. It's a personal decision about whether to have children under these circumstances. The question is whether his hesitation makes him an asshole. The key factors here are the intent to avoid suffering versus the potential for the child to have a good life despite the condition.\n\nThe author emphasizes not wanting to \"deprive\" the child, which suggests concern for the child's best interests. However, others might argue that by not having a child, they're avoiding the risk of the child living with a disability, which could be seen as a form of ableism. But I need to be careful here. It's not about discrimination in treatment, but about reproductive choices.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, parents are allowed to consider potential future hardships when deciding to have children. The father is trying to prevent his child from facing a severe condition. The line is thin between acting in the child's best interest and making a judgment about their life's value based on his own assumptions.\n\nThere's also the aspect of genetic counseling. They might have options like prenatal testing or adoption. But the question isn't about those options, just whether the hesitation is wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's concern is valid, and he's not necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might face such challenges. However, some might argue that people with disabilities can lead meaningful lives and that his decision is based on a biased view. But unless there's a certainty of the condition, it's a probabilistic choice. \n\nSo, the answer likely hinges on whether the author's reasoning is considered selfish or protective. Since the post is framed as a concern for the child's well-being, and not out of selfishness (he mentions not wanting to deprive the child), it's more about parental responsibility. Therefore, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
