      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to have a child who might develop retinitis pigmentosa, which affects men in the family and leads to blindness by their late 20s. The key points are that the condition is hereditary, affects sons, and the author is concerned about the child's quality of life. They mention their father-in-law's experience as an example of someone who lost vision and now has no job or social life.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical angle. The author is making a personal decision about whether to have children based on a genetic risk. They are not making a judgment about people with disabilities but are concerned about their child's future. They also clarify they don't want to offend anyone. So, their reasoning is about wanting to avoid a life of hardship for their potential child. \n\nOn one hand, some might argue that the author is being overly cautious or not accepting responsibility for potential challenges. They might say that people can lead fulfilling lives despite disabilities, and that it's not for the parents to decide the child's worth of life. On the other hand, parents often make decisions to protect their children from suffering, so this could be seen as a responsible choice.\n\nI should also think about the medical aspect. Retinitis pigmentosa is a progressive condition. If the child is male, there's a 50% chance. The author is considering the possibility of their child facing significant challenges, which is a valid concern. The father-in-law's experience is given as an example of the potential outcome, but individual experiences can vary. Some might argue that the author is assuming a bleak future based on one person's experience, while others might see it as a realistic assessment.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of procreative responsibility. Parents have a duty to consider the well-being of their children. If there's a known risk of a severe, untreatable condition, deciding not to have a child could be seen as a responsible choice. However, others might argue that technology or future medical advancements could mitigate the condition, so it's not certain.\n\nI need to remember that the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author's reasoning is morally justifiable. \n\nThe author isn't dismissing the value of people with disabilities but is making a personal decision about parenthood. They are trying to avoid what they see as a life of deprivation for their child. This seems to be a personal choice based on their values and what they believe is best for their future child. Unless there's a legal or ethical obligation to have a child despite the risks, it's a personal decision. \n\nSociety often respects individuals' rights to make choices about their reproductive lives based on personal ethics and circumstances. Therefore, the author's stance isn't inherently wrong. However, some might have a different perspective, but that doesn't make the author the asshole. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
