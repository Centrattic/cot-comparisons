      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong (AITA) for not wanting to have a child that might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which could lead to blindness in the 20s. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband's concern is valid because he doesn't want his child to face such a severe condition. RP is a genetic disorder that leads to progressive vision loss, and if the child is a boy, there's a 50% chance of inheriting it. The father is worried about the quality of life his child might have, referencing his own father's experience\u2014no job, no social life, etc. He's not being offensive but is considering the potential hardships.\n\nThe key here is the father's right to make decisions about having children based on health considerations. People often consider genetic risks when planning a family. Avoiding passing on a debilitating condition isn't uncommon. However, some might argue that it's a form of ableism, but the father explicitly states he's not being patronizing or offensive. He's making a personal choice based on the well-being of his future child.\n\nThe mother might have different views, especially if she's affected by RP and still has a fulfilling life. But the question is about whether the father is in the wrong. His stance is about preventing unnecessary suffering, which is a common ethical consideration. There's no indication he's making a hasty decision or not consulting medical advice. However, the decision to have children is complex, and differing opinions here don't necessarily make either party an \"asshole.\" But given the context, the father's concern is understandable and not inherently wrong.\n"
