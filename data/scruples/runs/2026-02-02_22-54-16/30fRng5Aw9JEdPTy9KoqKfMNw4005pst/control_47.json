      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether not wanting to have a child that might develop a genetic condition leading to blindness is considered being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person's wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects males. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he might go blind in his late 20s. The author is questioning if it's wrong to not want to have a child because of this risk, to avoid subjecting the child to a life with such a disability. They mention their wife's father's experience, who is blind and has a poor quality of life, no job, no social life. The author clarifies they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities.\n\nNow, the key points here are ethical considerations, autonomy, and the right to make reproductive choices. The author is considering not having a child to avoid potential suffering, which is a personal decision. There's no legal wrong here. From a moral standpoint, it's a matter of personal values. Some might argue that it's selfish to avoid bringing a child into the world even with challenges, while others would respect the right to choose based on potential quality of life.\n\nThe author also emphasizes they aren't being patronizing, which is important. The question is about whether they're an asshole (in the AITA sense). The community often considers intent and context. Since the author is making a personal choice without malicious intent towards the child or others, and they're acknowledging the gravity of the decision, it's more about personal ethics rather than being in the wrong. So, likely answer B.\n"
