      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have a child who might inherit a condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which leads to blindness in men by their late 20s. The author is concerned about their son potentially facing a life without sight, including the father's example of losing his job and social life. They clarify they don't mean to be offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Parents have the right to make decisions based on their values and what they believe is best for their children. The author is weighing the potential quality of life for their child. RP is a serious condition, and the author is trying to avoid subjecting their child to a life with significant challenges. \n\nHowever, there's also the perspective that life with disabilities can still be fulfilling, and that not having a child is a personal choice. The author isn't discriminating against people with disabilities but is making a decision based on their family's circumstances. It's important to note that the author is not planning to have a child solely because of this risk, which is their right.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's not for others to decide what's best for someone else's life, but in this case, the parents are making a choice about their own children. The key point is whether the author is being selfish or making a responsible decision. The author is trying to avoid potential suffering, which is a common parental concern.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They are making a difficult decision based on their understanding of the risks and their desire to provide the best life for their child. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
