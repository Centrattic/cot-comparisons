      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child that might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a condition that causes blindness, especially affecting men in the family. The question centers around whether the author's decision not to risk their child having this condition makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is expressing concern about their child's quality of life if they inherit RP. They mention the father's experience, who is blind and has no job or social life, which the author sees as a deprived existence. The author is worried about denying their child \"the joys of life.\" \n\nFrom a human rights perspective, every individual has the right to autonomy and to make decisions about their own reproductive choices. The author is not making a judgment about people with disabilities but is considering the potential hardships their child might face. It's important to note that the author explicitly states they don't intend to offend or patronize those living with disabilities. Their concern is about the child's future well-being and the challenges of living without sight, which could include limited employment opportunities, social isolation, and other difficulties mentioned.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is making a value judgment about the worth of life with a disability. However, the author's reasoning is based on their perception of the child's potential quality of life, not on a belief that people with disabilities have less value. They are weighing the risks and making a personal choice, which is a common part of reproductive decision-making, especially when hereditary conditions are involved.\n\nIt's also worth considering the genetic aspect. Since the condition affects males with a 50% chance, the author might be considering the ethical implications of passing on a genetic disorder that could significantly impact the child's life. This is similar to other genetic conditions where parents might choose not to have children or consider options like genetic screening. \n\nThe key here is that the author's decision is based on their own values and concerns for their child's future, not on malice or prejudice. They are trying to avoid what they see as a difficult life for their child. There's no indication that they are dismissing the value of the child's life if they have RP, just that they are concerned about the challenges associated with the condition. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. Their decision is a personal choice regarding family planning and is made with the intent to protect their child's well-being, not to devalue those with disabilities. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
