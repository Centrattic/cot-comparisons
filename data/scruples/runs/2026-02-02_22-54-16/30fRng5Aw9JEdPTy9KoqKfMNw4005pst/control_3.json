      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is the asshole. The situation is about whether it's wrong for the author not to want a child who might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), given the family history. The author is concerned about their son potentially going blind in his 20s, citing the father's experience of losing his vision and how it affected his life. They don't want to deprive their child of life's joys. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author is making a decision based on their understanding of their child's potential future. They're not dismissing disability but are concerned about the quality of life. The condition in question is a genetic one that affects males with a 50% chance. The father's experience is mentioned, showing the impact of the disease.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their child. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child with a disability, implying that such a life isn't worth living. However, the author clarifies they don't mean to offend anyone living with a disability, which suggests they respect people with disabilities but have personal concerns about the specific risks.\n\nThe key here is whether not wanting to have a child with a certain genetic condition is inherently wrong. There's a distinction between wanting to avoid suffering for the child and holding a judgment about the value of lives with disabilities. The author's reasoning is based on preventing potential suffering and the loss of life's joys. Their intention is to avoid what they see as a harsh future for their child, not to devalue the lives of those with RP.\n\nIn ethical terms, this touches on procreative responsibility and the right to reproduce. Laws in some places prohibit genetic discrimination, but personal decisions about having children are generally considered private. The author is not forcing anything on others but making a personal choice. The wife's perspective isn't presented, so we don't know her stance, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nPotential counterarguments might involve the unpredictability of medical advances\u2014maybe RP could be treated in the future. However, the author is making a decision based on current knowledge. Also, some might argue that life with RP can still be fulfilling, but the author is basing their decision on their father's negative experience. It's possible that the quality of life can vary, but the author is concerned about the potential for a severely diminished life.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether avoiding a child with a known risk of a debilitating condition is considered unethical. Many would say it's a personal choice, especially if the parents are informed and not acting out of prejudice. The author isn't opposing having children entirely but is considering the specific risk. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), as it's their right to make such a decision based on their values and the information they have.\n"
