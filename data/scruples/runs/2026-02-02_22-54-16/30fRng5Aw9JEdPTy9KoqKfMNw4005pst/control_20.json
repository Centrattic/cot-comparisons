      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether not wanting to have a child who might inherit a condition that leads to blindness by age 20 makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about their child potentially suffering from retinitis pigmentosa, which affects men in the family. The condition leads to blindness in the late 20s. The author's reasoning is that they don't want their child to miss out on life's joys, citing the grandfather's experience of being blind, jobless, and having no social life. They clarify they don't mean to be offensive to those with disabilities.\n\nHmm, from a moral standpoint, people have the right to make choices about their family based on their values and what they believe is best for their potential children. The author isn't discriminating against someone already born but is considering future possibilities. It's about quality of life for the child. However, some might argue that it's a form of ableism, assuming that a life with a disability isn't worth living. But the author does state they don't want to \"deprive\" the child, which suggests concern for the child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, others might say that genetic conditions can be managed, and people with disabilities lead fulfilling lives. But the condition here has severe outcomes. The key is whether the author's decision is based on fear or genuine concern versus prejudice. The author seems to be weighing the potential suffering against the child's future happiness.\n\nAlso, the author isn't making a judgment on existing people but is making a personal choice about procreation. So, in terms of ethics, it's a personal decision. Therefore, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They're considering their child's future and making a choice based on that.\n"
