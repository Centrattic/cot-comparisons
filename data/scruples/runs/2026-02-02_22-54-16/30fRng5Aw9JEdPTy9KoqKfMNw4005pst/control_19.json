      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to have a kid who might develop retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which could lead to blindness by age 20, specifically affecting males in the family. The father is concerned about the child's quality of life, citing examples like his wife's father who became blind, lost his job, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. The father's hesitation is about not wanting his child to suffer from a condition that significantly impacts their life. But at the same time, there's the argument about autonomy\u2014should parents decide such a major thing for their child's future? Also, there's the aspect of not wanting to bring a child into a situation with a certain risk, even if it's a 50% chance. \n\nOn the other hand, the decision to have children is personal. The couple has a right to make choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their family. However, some might argue that the father is being overly cautious or discriminatory by avoiding having a child with a potential disability, even if the condition is inherited. But the key here is that the condition is hereditary and there's a 50% chance for a boy, so it's not a sure thing. They could also consider genetic counseling or other options like in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis to screen embryos, which might mitigate the risk. \n\nThe father's concern about the child's quality of life is valid. He's not trying to be offensive but is thinking about the child's future. However, the question is whether his stance makes him the asshole. The term \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often looks for moral judgment. In this context, the father is making a personal decision based on his values and the potential suffering of the child. Since it's a personal choice and they're considering all factors, including the possibility of not having a child, it's within their rights. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the father is making a personal decision based on the potential risks and his values. However, there's a nuance in ethics about procreative responsibility. Some might argue against making such a decision based on potential disability, but given the information and the options available, the father isn't in the wrong. Also, the post clarifies that they don't intend to offend, and it's about their personal dilemma.\n"
