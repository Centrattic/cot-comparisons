      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask the Asker (AITA) post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which can lead to blindness by age 20 in males. The writer's wife has a family history of this condition, and there's a 50% chance their son would inherit it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical and moral implications here. The author is concerned about their child's quality of life if they inherit the condition. They mention that the father of the wife has lost his vision, leading to a life without a job or social life. The author is saying they don't want their child to experience that. \n\nRetinitis Pigmentosa is a genetic disorder. If it's X-linked recessive, since the wife has it in her family and it affects males more, then a son has a 50% chance of getting it if the mother is a carrier. The author is considering not having children because of this risk. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's stance is selfish or a valid concern for their child's well-being. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on the potential suffering and challenges their child might face. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to decide against having a child based on a genetic predisposition, especially since the condition doesn't define a person's worth and individuals with RP can lead fulfilling lives with adaptations. \n\nHowever, the author isn't opposing having children in general; they're specifically concerned about a hereditary condition that could significantly impact their child's life. They also clarify that they aren't being patronizing or offensive. The decision to have children is deeply personal and involves weighing potential hardships. \n\nIn ethical terms, this is a complex issue. The author is prioritizing their child's quality of life, which is a common parental instinct. Others might argue that it's a form of ableism, but the author isn't looking down on people with disabilities; they're considering the future challenges. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They're making a personal choice based on their values and concerns for their child's future. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
