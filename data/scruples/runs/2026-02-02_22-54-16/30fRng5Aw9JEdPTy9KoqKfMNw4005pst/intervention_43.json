      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is considering not having a child because there's a genetic condition, Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects men in the family. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he'll go blind in his 20s. The author is worried about depriving the child of life's joys, like the father's experience, who is blind and has no job or social life. The author clarifies they don't want to be offensive and used a throwaway in case the wife is reading it.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the AITA standards. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. The question is about personal decision-making regarding having children based on genetic risks. \n\nIn general, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their family. The author isn't discriminating against someone already born; they're considering potential future scenarios. The condition is a serious one with significant life impacts, so it's reasonable for parents to want to avoid that if possible. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is making a judgment about a potential future child's quality of life. But unless there's a clear and severe negative impact that parents have a moral obligation to prevent, it's more of a personal choice. The author also mentions they don't intend to be offensive, so it's not about devaluing people with disabilities but about their own child's well-being.\n\nI think the key here is that the decision is based on the parents' assessment of their child's future. As long as they're not making harmful decisions against an existing child, it's their right to choose. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
