      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retina Pigmentosa (RP), which could lead to blindness in their 20s. The key points here are the ethical considerations of procreation with potential genetic risks and societal views on disability.\n\nFirst, the author's concern is about the quality of life for their potential child. They mention that if their child is a boy, there's a 50% chance of blindness in the late 20s. They express not wanting to deprive the child of life's joys, citing their father-in-law's experience as an example. The author clarifies that they're not being offensive towards people with disabilities, which is an important point.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, this is a complex issue. On one hand, parents have a responsibility to consider their child's well-being. Avoiding knowingly passing on a severe condition could be seen as a protective measure. On the other hand, some argue that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives, and not having a child might be seen as a failure to accept the unknown.\n\nThe author isn't dismissing the value of life for people with disabilities but is making a personal choice based on their assessment of potential suffering. RP is a progressive condition, leading to significant loss of vision. The father-in-law's experience (no job, social life) is presented as a negative outcome. However, each individual's experience with disability can vary based on support systems, technology, and personal adaptability.\n\nSocietal perspectives also matter. Some might view the author's stance as eugenic thinking, which historically has been problematic. Others might support the decision, emphasizing the right to avoid unnecessary suffering. The author isn't choosing to harm the child but is making a choice based on perceived future harm.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing the prevention of a known, severe condition. Since the question is about being an \"asshole,\" it's important to consider intent and malice. The author doesn't seem to be malicious but is making a difficult decision. They also express respect for people with disabilities, which counters any accusation of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is a personal ethical choice, not necessarily wrong. They are weighing potential future harm against the desire to have a child. There's no clear right or wrong here, but based on the information given and the lack of malice, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
