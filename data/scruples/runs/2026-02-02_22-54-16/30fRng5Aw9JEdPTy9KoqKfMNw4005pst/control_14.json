      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not wanting to have a child who might develop retinitis pigmentosa, which could lead to blindness by age 20. The condition affects men in the family, with a 50% chance if they have a son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The user is concerned about their potential child's quality of life and the hardships that come with blindness. They mention their wife's family history and the suffering of their father-in-law, who is blind and has a limited life. The user is worried about subjecting their child to a similar fate, so they're hesitant to have a child. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the idea of parental responsibility and the right to procreate despite genetic risks. In many ethical frameworks, parents have the right to make decisions based on what they believe is best for their children's future. However, there's also a counterargument that life is valuable regardless of challenges, and that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives with support.\n\nBut in this case, the user isn't dismissing the value of life with a disability. They're making a personal choice based on the potential hardships. They also clarify that they aren't trying to offend those with disabilities. The key here is that the decision is about their own family planning, not society's judgment on disabled individuals. \n\nI think the user's reasoning is valid. They're considering the well-being of a future child, and their decision is based on preventing avoidable suffering. Unless there's a clear ethical obligation to have children regardless of risks (which varies by cultural and personal beliefs), the user isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
