      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about deciding whether to have a child when there's a genetic risk of the child (specifically a son) developing retinitis pigmentosa, which could lead to blindness in their 20s. The author is conflicted because they don't want their child to suffer from such a condition and miss out on life's joys. They mention their wife's family history, with the father being blind and having a difficult life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a decision based on their perception of what's best for their potential child. On one hand, it's about preventing suffering and ensuring a better quality of life. On the other hand, it's a choice that involves not bringing a child into the world, which could be seen as a personal decision. However, others might argue that it's a form of ableism, suggesting that people with disabilities can still live fulfilling lives. \n\nThe author clarifies they don't intend to offend anyone with disabilities, which is a good point. They're not dismissing the value of people with such conditions but are concerned about the specific hardships their child might face. The question is whether their reasoning is valid or if they're wrong for not wanting a child with a disability.\n\nIn many ethical discussions, people have different views on this. Some believe that parents should not make decisions based on potential disabilities, advocating for the right to life regardless of circumstances. Others agree that parents have the right to make such choices to protect their child from suffering. The key here is that the author is not making a judgment about the worth of people with disabilities but is considering the potential hardships. \n\nThe wife's perspective isn't mentioned, so it's unclear if there's mutual agreement. However, the focus is on the author's feelings and decision-making process. Since the author is not discriminating against the child but trying to prevent potential suffering, it's more about their personal ethics. Most people would likely understand this as a difficult but personal choice. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
