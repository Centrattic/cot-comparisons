      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The user and their wife are discussing having kids, but there's a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) on the wife's side. This condition affects men in the family, and if they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is questioning if they're the asshole for not wanting to have a child who might end up blind, leading to a life without the joys of sight, like the father-in-law who's blind and has no job or social life. They clarify they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities and made a throwaway account because the wife is around.\n\nFirst, I should check the facts about RP. Retinitis Pigmentosa is a genetic disorder that causes progressive vision loss. It's usually inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked pattern. Since the author mentions it affects the men in the wife's family, it might be X-linked. If the wife is a carrier (since she's female and X-linked recessive), she could pass the affected X to her sons, giving them a 50% chance of having the disease. Daughters would have a 50% chance of being carriers. So the author's understanding is correct.\n\nNow, the ethical question: is the author wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop RP? The user is concerned about the child's quality of life and the potential hardships. Some might argue that it's selfish to not want to have a child who might face such challenges, but others might say it's responsible to consider the child's well-being. It's a tough balance between personal choices and ethical responsibilities.\n\nThe author emphasizes not wanting to deprive the child of life's joys, which are important. However, people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives, and the lack of job or social life mentioned might be due to other factors, not just blindness. It's also possible that with modern medicine and support, the severity of RP could be managed better than in the past. \n\nBut the author isn't making a judgment against people with disabilities; they're making a personal choice based on their understanding of the risks. They also mention they don't want to offend, so their intent is to seek advice, not to be dismissive. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the term here is about whether they're being unreasonable or cruel. The author's hesitation seems to stem from genuine concern for the child's future, which is a valid consideration when making life decisions about having children. There's no indication they're looking to discriminate or devalue people with disabilities, just making a personal choice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're making a personal decision based on potential future implications, and it's their right to choose whether to have children given the genetic risks involved.\n"
