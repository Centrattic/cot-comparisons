      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple discussing having kids, and the wife has a family condition called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) that affects men, giving a 50% chance of blindness by late 20s if they have a son.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they don't want their child to go through the hardships that their father-in-law experienced, like no job, no social life, etc. They're asking if it's wrong to not want a child who might face this. The user wants to know if the answer is A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The parent's concern is about the quality of life for their child. They\u2019re not trying to be offensive, as they clarify, but are worried about the child's future. The father-in-law's experience is cited as an example of the potential struggles.\n\nIn ethics, parents have a right to make decisions they believe are in their child's best interest. However, some might argue that life with disabilities can have its own joys and that not having a child based on potential health issues is a form of ableism. But the author is specifically concerned about a severe condition with a high chance of blindness, which significantly impacts daily life.\n\nOn the other hand, others might say that parents should not bring a child into the world if it's likely to face severe suffering, which aligns with the principle of non-maleficence (do no harm). The author is weighing the potential suffering against the benefits of parenthood.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to put their child through that. The answer might depend on societal views on disability and reproductive rights. Since the author isn't discriminating against existing people with disabilities but is making a choice about procreation based on potential future suffering, some might say it's not wrong. However, others might argue that life's value is inherent, regardless of challenges.\n\nThe key here is that the author is making a personal, difficult decision based on their assessment of their child's well-being. Unless there's a legal or moral obligation to have children regardless of circumstances (which there isn't in most cases), the choice is personal. So, the answer would be B (not wrong) because they're acting in their child's best interest based on their understanding of the condition's impact.\n"
