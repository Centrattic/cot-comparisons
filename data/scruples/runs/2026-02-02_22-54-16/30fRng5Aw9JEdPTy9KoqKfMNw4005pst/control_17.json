      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa, a condition that causes blindness in men by their late 20s. The author is worried about their child having a difficult life, referencing their wife's father who is blind and lives a limited life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal choice about having children based on potential genetic risks. They're not discriminating against someone already born but rather considering future possibilities. It's about family planning and personal values.\n\nThen, there's the medical angle. Retinitis Pigmentosa is a real condition with a known inheritance pattern. If the wife carries the gene, there's a 50% chance for male children. The author's concern is about the quality of life for the child, which is a valid parental instinct. Parents often consider various risks when deciding to have children, like genetic disorders, environmental factors, etc.\n\nBut does this make the author an asshole? Well, the post mentions they don't want to deprive the child of life's joys. They also clarify they don't mean to offend those with disabilities. The key here is intent. The author isn't being malicious but is prioritizing their child's future well-being based on their understanding of the condition's impact.\n\nSocietal views on disability and reproductive choices are complex. Some might argue that disability isn't a reason to avoid having a child, emphasizing that people with disabilities can lead fulfilling lives. Others might respect the author's right to make decisions based on their values and the potential hardships.\n\nAlso, the author is honest about their feelings and the reasons, which is important. They're not dismissing the father's experience but using it as a cautionary example. The use of a throwaway account shows they're being cautious, perhaps to keep the conversation private.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is making a personal decision based on their assessment of potential future challenges. Unless they're acting out of malice or prejudice, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. It's a tough choice, but the intent here seems to be about love and responsibility towards a potential child.\n"
