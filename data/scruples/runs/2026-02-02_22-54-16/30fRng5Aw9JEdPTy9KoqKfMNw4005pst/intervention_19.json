      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to have a child who might develop retinitis pigmentosa, which leads to blindness in the late 20s. The key points here are the ethical considerations around having children with potential disabilities, the author's justification for not wanting their child to suffer, and the broader societal views on this.\n\nFirst, the author's concern is about the quality of life for their potential child. They mention that the father in the wife's family has gone blind and has a diminished life, so they don't want their son to experience the same. Is it wrong to consider the child's future well-being in such a way? Some people argue that it's reasonable to avoid knowingly bringing a child into the world with a severe, debilitating condition. Others might say that it's not for parents to decide the value of a life, and that disability doesn't equate to a life not worth living.\n\nThe author also clarifies they don't mean to be offensive to people with disabilities. That's a point in their favor, showing they're not being discriminatory but are making a personal choice. However, there's a line between making a personal choice and making assumptions about someone else's life. The father in the scenario is an adult who can make his own decisions, but the child would not have a choice. The parents are making a decision based on their perception of what's best, which can be seen as a form of ableism if it's based on the assumption that a life with disability is worse.\n\nBut then again, parents often make decisions based on what they believe is best for their children. Not all parents might consider genetic risks, so the author is being proactive. The 50% chance is a significant risk, and the outcome is a severe condition. It's a personal choice, but is it wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the author is not using this as a way to discriminate generally but is making a specific choice based on this high-risk condition, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they're making assumptions about the child's happiness or life quality, that's more controversial.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the decision is personal and based on concern for the child's future. However, there's a counterargument that it's still wrong to decide for the child. But given the severity of the condition and the author's clarification that they don't mean to be offensive, it's more about personal responsibility and ethical considerations. So, I'd say B.\n"
