      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about deciding not to have a child because of a genetic condition that could lead to blindness in the child's late 20s, specifically for a son. The author is questioning if they're being an asshole for not wanting their child to have such a future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is making a personal choice based on their perception of quality of life for their potential child. Retinitis pigmentosa is a degenerative condition leading to blindness, and the father is worried about the child's future. The question is whether it's morally wrong to avoid having a child to prevent that outcome.\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to make decisions about their family planning based on their values and what they believe is best for their children. They might consider the challenges the child would face, like the father mentioned\u2014no job, social life, etc.\u2014and decide they don't want to subject the child to that. It's about protecting the child from potential suffering.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that life with a disability can still be fulfilling. The author's reasoning could be seen as making assumptions about the child's happiness and capabilities. Also, the decision to not have a child because of a genetic risk could be viewed as discriminatory or as a lack of acceptance of people with disabilities. However, the author does clarify that they aren't trying to offend anyone, so their intentions might be compassionate.\n\nThere's also the aspect of reproductive rights and autonomy. The couple is discussing their options, and the author is expressing their concerns. It's a shared decision, so it's their choice to make together. The key point here is that the author isn't forcing anything; they're considering their options based on potential outcomes.\n\nI should also think about the AITA context. These threads often involve personal choices where the answer isn't clear-cut. The community usually considers intent, harm, and whether the person is being unreasonable. In this case, the author's intent is to avoid what they see as a deprived life for their child. They are not blaming the condition's sufferers but are focused on their child's future. The decision is about personal values, which are subjective. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having this perspective. Others may disagree, but that doesn't make the author the asshole here.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that life with a disability is still valuable and that the author is making a judgment about the child's worth. But the author isn't devaluing people with disabilities; they're making a decision based on their own values about parenthood. It's a personal choice, not a judgment on others' lives.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is a matter of personal ethics and parenting choices. Since they are not causing harm and are making an informed decision within their rights, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
