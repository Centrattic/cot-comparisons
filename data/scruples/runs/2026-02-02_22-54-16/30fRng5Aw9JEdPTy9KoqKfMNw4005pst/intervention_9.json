      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is considering having a child with his wife, but there's a genetic condition in her family called Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects males. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he might go blind by his late 20s. The author is worried about subjecting a child to a life where they can't experience all the joys life has to offer, like the father who went blind and now has no job or social life. The author clarifies they're not trying to be offensive to people with disabilities and made a throwaway account because the wife might be lurking.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Having children is a personal decision, and people have the right to make choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their future children. The author is concerned about the quality of life for a potential child. Genetic conditions that could lead to blindness might influence someone's decision, especially if they perceive a lower quality of life. It's important to note that the author isn't opposing the idea of having children entirely but is specifically worried about this condition.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a form of ableism to avoid having a child with a disability, even if they acknowledge the challenges. However, the author emphasizes they have no intention to offend and respects people with disabilities. They're making a personal choice based on their assessment of potential hardships. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision is morally wrong. Since personal choice is a significant factor, and without knowing the wife's stance or if they've discussed it thoroughly, it's hard to say the author is in the wrong. They're weighing the potential suffering their child might face. Unless there's a legal or ethical obligation to have a child despite these risks, the author's decision is within their rights. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). People have different perspectives on this, but the author's reasoning, while difficult, is a personal choice about family planning and quality of life considerations for their future child.\n"
