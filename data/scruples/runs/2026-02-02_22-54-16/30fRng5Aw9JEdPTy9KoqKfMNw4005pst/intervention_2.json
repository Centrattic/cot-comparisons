      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop retinitis pigmentosa, which could lead to blindness in their 20s. The key points here are about personal choice, medical ethics, and societal attitudes towards disabilities.\n\nFirst, the author is making a personal decision based on their values and what they believe is best for their future child. They're considering the potential hardships the child might face, like the father's experience of losing vision and the resulting impact on his life. The author emphasizes that they don't intend to offend anyone but are trying to avoid a situation they see as undesirable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their circumstances and beliefs. The condition in question has a 50% chance of affecting male children, which is a significant risk. The author is weighing the potential suffering against the benefits of parenthood. There's no legal wrong here, as they're not making a decision that affects others beyond their own family planning.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child with a disability, even if it's based on genetic risk. But the author isn't discriminating against someone with a disability; they're choosing not to bring a child into the world with a condition they believe would cause significant hardship. This is a nuanced area where personal ethics and societal values can clash.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's decision is a personal one, made without malice and with consideration for the child's well-being. They're not harming anyone else and are acting within their rights. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
