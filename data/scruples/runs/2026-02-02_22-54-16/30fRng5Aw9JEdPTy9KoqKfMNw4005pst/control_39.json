      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a child who might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa, which could lead to blindness by age 20. The author is concerned about their child's quality of life, using their wife's family history as a basis. They mention not wanting their child to miss out on life's joys, like the father who went blind and lost his job and social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a personal choice about having children based on genetic risks. The condition is X-linked recessive, so if the wife has the gene, sons have a 50% chance of getting it. The author is worried about their child's future, which is a common concern in family planning. \n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to not want to have a child with such a risk. It's a personal decision, and while some might argue that life with a disability is still valuable, the author isn't dismissing the value of life but is concerned about potential hardships. The author also clarifies they don't intend to offend anyone with disabilities, which is important. \n\nI should consider if the author is being discriminatory. Choosing not to have a child due to a genetic disorder isn't necessarily inconsiderate; it's about the family's readiness to handle the challenges. Parents often consider various factors when deciding to have children, including health risks, financial stability, etc. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is making a judgment about the worth of a life with a disability. But the author's focus is on their child's well-being and not wanting them to suffer avoidable hardships. It's a personal choice, and unless they are actively discriminating against people with disabilities in general, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nThe wife's perspective is also important, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author is not advocating against people with disabilities but is making a personal family decision, the answer might lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong. However, I need to make sure there's no clear ethical violation here. The author isn't forced to have children, so their choice is within their rights.\n"
