      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to have a kid who might go blind at 20 due to a genetic condition. The wife's family has Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects males. If they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he'll be blind by his late 20s. The author doesn't want to subject their child to that life, citing examples like the husband's father who's blind, has no job or social life.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child with that risk. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider ethical viewpoints here. On one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their child. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child with a disability, even if it's for their well-being.\n\nBut the author isn't making a judgment about people with disabilities; they're saying they don't want their child to face hardships. The example given is about the father's quality of life. It's a complex issue. The author is also clear they don't mean to offend. The wife's condition is genetic, so they're considering the implications of passing it on.\n\nI think the key here is personal choice. People can have different reasons for not wanting to have children, including medical risks. Unless there's a clear ethical violation, like discrimination based on disability, it's their decision. The author isn't forcing anyone; they're choosing not to have a child to prevent potential suffering. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
