      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might inherit a condition leading to blindness in their 20s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects males. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind by his late 20s. The author is concerned about the child's quality of life, using examples like the husband's father being blind, jobless, and socially isolated. The author is asking if they're an asshole for not wanting to put their child through that.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. I need to decide if the answer is A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their future children. The author isn't discriminating against people with disabilities but is considering the potential hardships. The key here is intent: the author emphasizes they don't want to \"deprive\" their child of life's joys and clarify they aren't being offensive. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is making a judgment about a potential life based on their own assumptions about the quality of life with RP. Others might say that with advancements in medicine, the child might have a better experience than previous generations, or that support systems could be in place to help. But the author is making a personal choice based on the information they have.\n\nEthically, it's about reproductive rights and personal responsibility. The author is considering the child's well-being, which is a valid concern. Unless there's a legal or ethical obligation that the author is violating, their choice seems personal. Since the post mentions they're in the planning stage and not actually having the child yet, there's no action taken yet, so no wrongdoing in the decision-making process itself.\n\nAlso, the author is making it clear they don't intend to be offensive, which is important. The question is whether their reasoning is morally wrong. Many would argue that parents have the right to make such decisions, even if others disagree. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
