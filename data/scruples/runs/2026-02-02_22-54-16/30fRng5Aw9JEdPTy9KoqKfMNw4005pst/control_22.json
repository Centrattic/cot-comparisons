      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is whether the author is an asshole for not wanting to have a child who might potentially go blind at age 20 due to a family condition called Retina Pigmentosa, which affects men in the family. The author's wife has this condition, and if they have a boy, there's a 50% chance he could inherit it and go blind in his late 20s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the genetic aspect. Retina Pigmentosa (RP) is a group of genetic disorders that affect the retina. It's usually inherited in an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked manner. Since the user mentions that it affects the men in the family, that might suggest an X-linked inheritance. If the mother is a carrier and the father is unaffected, a son has a 50% chance of inheriting the X chromosome with the affected gene, leading to RP. A daughter would have a 50% chance of being a carrier but wouldn't express the condition if the father is unaffected. So the scenario the author describes seems plausible.\n\nNow, the author is saying they don't want to have a child (specifically a son) who might end up blind, which would deprive the child of life's joys. The author is concerned about the quality of life for the child, citing the example of the grandfather who went blind and lost his job and social life. The author emphasizes they're not being offensive to those with disabilities but are making a personal choice based on these potential outcomes.\n\nIs the author wrong for this? Well, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their potential children. The author isn't discriminating against someone already born; they're considering the potential future of a child they haven't had yet. However, there's a debate here about whether it's ethical to choose not to have a child with certain conditions. Some argue that life is worth living regardless of disabilities, and others believe parents should prepare to support their child regardless of challenges.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the desire to prevent their child from suffering a life-altering condition. They acknowledge the severity of blindness and the impact it could have. But does that make them an asshole? The key here is whether the author is making a judgment that's offensive or harmful. Since they're not devaluing people with disabilities but rather choosing not to bring a child into a situation where they might face such challenges, it's more about personal ethics and reproductive rights.\n\nHowever, some might argue that by choosing not to have a child with a potential disability, the author is displaying ableism, the belief that people with disabilities are worse off and need to be prevented from existing. But the author's post doesn't seem to devalue people with disabilities; they're more concerned with the child's quality of life as described. They also clarify they don't intend to offend anyone.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a spectrum. Some people believe it's acceptable to use genetic information to make reproductive decisions, while others think that's playing God. The author's situation is a personal choice that involves weighing potential suffering against the value of life. Without more context on the family's support for individuals with RP, it's hard to say if the author is wrong. But given that they're making a decision based on their understanding of the risks and their desire to protect their future child, it's within their rights as prospective parents.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is a personal one, and they're not acting with malice toward people with disabilities. They're trying to make a responsible choice based on their knowledge and values. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
