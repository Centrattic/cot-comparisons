      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for not wanting a child who might inherit a condition that could lead to blindness. The condition is retinitis pigmentosa, which affects men in the family. The person is worried about their son potentially going blind in his late 20s and not wanting to subject him to that life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical and moral angles here. The author is concerned about their child's quality of life. They mention that their wife's father has the condition and is blind, which has impacted his ability to work or have a social life. The author isn't trying to be offensive, they clarify, and they're not against people with disabilities. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to have a child if there's a 50% chance the son would inherit this. The options are A (the author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to make reproductive choices based on their beliefs and what they think is best for their potential children. There's a concept called the \"procreative responsibility\" where parents consider the well-being of the child. If there's a significant risk of a serious condition that would lead to a diminished quality of life, some ethical frameworks support the decision to avoid having a child in such circumstances. \n\nHowever, others might argue that life is valuable and that a person with a disability can still have a fulfilling life, and that parents shouldn't make such decisions for their children. But in this case, the author isn't dismissing the value of life with a disability; they're specifically concerned about the child's experience of life. \n\nAlso, the author is clear that they don't intend to offend people living with disabilities. This shows they've considered the sensitivity of the issue. The use of a throwaway account because the wife is lurking suggests that they're sharing this in confidence, possibly seeking support without her knowing. \n\nThe condition in question affects men, so if they have a daughter, the risk is different. The 50% chance applies only to sons. The author is considering the potential suffering of their son, which is a valid parental concern. \n\nIn legal terms, there's no law against having a child with a disability, but the decision is personal. Ethically, it's a complex issue. The key points are the parent's responsibility to consider the child's future well-being and their own capacity to provide care. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not wrong for making a personal decision based on their ethical beliefs about their child's future quality of life. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
