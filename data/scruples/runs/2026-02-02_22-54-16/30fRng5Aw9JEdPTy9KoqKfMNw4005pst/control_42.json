      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have a child who might inherit Retinitis Pigmentosa, which can lead to blindness in their 20s, especially affecting males. The author is concerned about the child's quality of life based on their father's experience.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is weighing their own reproductive choices against potential suffering for their child. They mention not wanting to \"deprive\" their child of life's joys. But is it wrong to consider such a significant health risk before deciding to have children?\n\nRetinitis Pigmentosa is a genetic condition. If the wife has a family history where only males are affected, it's likely an X-linked recessive inheritance. So, if the mother is a carrier, each son has a 50% chance of getting it. The author is thinking about the implications of that.\n\nThe key question is whether it's morally wrong to not want to have a child who might inherit a condition that could severely impact their life. On one hand, the author is being proactive about their child's well-being. On the other, some might argue that disability doesn't equate to a life not worth living, and the parents could provide support regardless.\n\nThe author clarifies they don't intend to patronize or offend, which is important. They also mention their reasons are about the child's quality of life. The father's example (uncle) is given as someone without a job or social life, which might influence the author's perspective.\n\nBut is the author wrong for prioritizing avoiding this risk? Some might say no, as parents have the right to consider potential hardships. Others might argue that disabilities don't make life less valuable and that the author should support the child if they have it. The line between prevention and discrimination is tricky here.\n\nAlso, the author's wife is part of the situation, so the decision isn't just theirs. They might have conflicting views. The post seems to be more about seeking validation for their feelings rather than making a judgment call about others.\n\nIn AITA terms, if the author is not pressuring the wife or being disrespectful, they might not be the asshole. They're expressing a personal choice based on their values. The answer would depend on whether not wanting to take that risk is ethically wrong. Given the lack of coercion and the author's genuine concern for the child's future, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong.\n"
