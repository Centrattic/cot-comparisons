      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The person is considering not having a child because there's a genetic condition in their wife's family called Retina Pigmentosa, which affects males. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind in his late 20s. The author is worried about subjecting a child to that, where the father of the wife already lost his vision and can't work or socialize. The author is asking if they're an asshole for not wanting that for their kid.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. People often make decisions about having children based on various factors, including health risks. The author's concern is about the quality of life for the potential child. They mention not wanting to deprive the child of life's joys, which is a common parental instinct. However, some might argue that it's discriminatory or eugenic thinking to avoid having a child with a disability.\n\nOn the other hand, the author also clarifies they don't mean to offend those living with disabilities. That's an important point. They're not devaluing people with disabilities but are considering the potential hardships their child might face. There's also the aspect of the child's autonomy\u2014if the child were born with the condition, they might make their own choices about their life, just like the wife's father did.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no law against not having children due to genetic concerns. However, the debate often centers around the rights of the potential child versus the parents' right to choose. Pro-choice in procreation terms usually allows parents to make these decisions based on their conscience.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being selfish or acting in the child's best interest. The author is trying to prevent suffering, which is a protective instinct. But some might say that they're making a judgment about the value of a life with a disability. However, given that the author isn't opposing disability rights but is choosing not to have a child for medical reasons, it's a personal choice. Unless there's a known way to mitigate the condition, which isn't mentioned here, the decision seems based on genuine concern for the child's future well-being.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a personal choice to avoid a known risk, and their reasoning is based on protecting the child's quality of life, without malice or prejudice.\n"
