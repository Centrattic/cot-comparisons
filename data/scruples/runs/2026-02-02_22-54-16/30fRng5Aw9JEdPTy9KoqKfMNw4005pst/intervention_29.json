      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child with a 50% chance of going blind in their 20s. The condition, Retina Pigmentosa, affects the men in the family. The author is concerned about their son potentially losing his vision, leading to a life without the usual experiences like a job or social life, as seen in his wife's father. The author is questioning whether it's selfish to not want to put a child through that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a personal choice based on their understanding of their child's potential future. They explicitly state they don't want to \"deprive\" their child of life's joys, which is a common parental concern. The key point is that they're not making a judgment about people with disabilities but are focused on the child's quality of life.\n\nOn one hand, some might argue that life with a disability can still be fulfilling, and the author is making a decision based on their own fears without knowing the child's perspective. However, others might support the author's decision, emphasizing that parents have the right to consider potential hardships when planning a family. The author also clarifies they aren't trying to offend anyone with disabilities, which shows awareness and respect.\n\nAnother angle is the genetic risk. Since it's a 50% chance for a son, the author is weighing the probability against the potential suffering. It's a personal choice about parenthood, and while some might question if they're overestimating the negative outcomes, the author's intention is to avoid unnecessary suffering. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent, harm, and fairness. The author isn't targeting the wife or her family but is voicing a personal concern. The wife's side might feel hurt if the author is dismissive of her family's experience, but the author is trying to be considerate. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a difficult decision based on their values and the information they have. The answer should be B.\n"
