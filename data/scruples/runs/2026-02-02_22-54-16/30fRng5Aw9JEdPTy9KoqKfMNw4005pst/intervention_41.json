Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're an asshole for not wanting to have a child that might inherit Retinitis Pigmentosa, which causes blindness by their 20s. The wife's family has a history of this condition affecting males. The person is worried about their child, a boy, having a 50% chance of going blind. They mention their father-in-law is blind, has no job or social life, and they don't want their child to have a similar life. They clarify they're not being offensive and are using a throwaway because their wife might see it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal choice about having children based on potential health risks. It's their right to decide whether to have children and the circumstances under which they do. The condition is hereditary, so they're aware of the risks. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's not their place to decide for the child's future. But the author isn't making a decision for the child post-birth; they're choosing not to have a child at all due to the risk. That's a personal reproductive choice, which is generally considered a private matter. \n\nThe author does express concern for the child's well-being, not just their own. They're trying to avoid subjecting a child to a life that might be difficult. They also state they're not being offensive to people with disabilities, which is important. People with disabilities can live fulfilling lives, but the author is considering the specific hardships associated with this condition. \n\nAnother angle: the author might be overestimating the negative impact of the condition. Maybe the child could adapt and lead a happy life with support. But that's speculative. The author's perspective is based on their understanding of the condition and their father-in-law's experience. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether the author is being unreasonable or cruel. Since they're considering the child's potential suffering and making a personal choice, not forcing anything on others, it seems more like a difficult decision rather than being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author is in a discussion with their wife, so this is part of a mutual decision-making process. The question is whether not wanting to have the child makes them an asshole. The answer would likely depend on cultural or moral views on disability and reproductive rights. \n\nMost people would respect the right to make such a choice, even if they disagree. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
