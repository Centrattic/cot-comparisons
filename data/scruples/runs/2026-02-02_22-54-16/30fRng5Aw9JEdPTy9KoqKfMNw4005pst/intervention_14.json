      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop retinitis pigmentosa. The condition causes blindness in men from the family, with a 50% chance if the child is a boy. The author is concerned about the child's quality of life, citing their father who's blind and has no job or social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal choice based on potential future suffering of their child. They're not looking to discriminate but to avoid a life they perceive as deprived. The key here is whether it's wrong to choose not to have a child to prevent possible suffering. \n\nGenetic conditions and reproductive choices are tricky. People have the right to make decisions about their family planning, especially when considering hereditary diseases. The author isn't trying to harm anyone; they're concerned about their child's well-being. They also mention they don't want to offend anyone with disabilities, which shows they're aware of the sensitivity.\n\nHowever, some might argue that life's value isn't defined by the absence of disability. But the author's intention is preventive, not discriminatory. They're weighing the potential quality of life against the risk. \n\nAlso, the situation involves a medical condition with a known inheritance pattern. Making an informed decision based on that is responsible. So, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their child's possible future well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
