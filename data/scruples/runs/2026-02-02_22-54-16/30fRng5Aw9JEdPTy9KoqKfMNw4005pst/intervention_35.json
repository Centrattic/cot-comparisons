      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nThe situation is about a couple discussing having children. The wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects males in the family. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind by his late 20s. The husband is saying he doesn't want to put his child through that and doesn't want to deprive them of life's joys. He also mentions that his father-in-law, who has the condition, has no job or social life. The husband is questioning if he's an asshole for not wanting a kid in that scenario.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of reproductive choices. People have the right to make decisions about having children based on their circumstances and the potential quality of life for the child. Genetic risks are a valid concern. The husband is expressing concern for his future child's well-being, which is a common reason people might choose not to have children. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child because of a disability. But the husband isn't necessarily opposing the child's existence if it doesn't happen; he's making a choice based on the risk. Also, he's clear that he's not trying to insult those with disabilities. \n\nThe key here is whether the decision is considered selfish. The husband is prioritizing the child's potential quality of life, which is a personal and ethical decision. There's no legal wrong here, and socially, people's views might differ. But in terms of being in the \"wrong,\" it's more about personal values. Most people would respect someone's choice to not have a child due to such risks, especially when considering the child's future. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because he's making a personal choice about parenthood based on genetic risks and potential quality of life for his child. It's a difficult decision, but not one that typically makes someone an asshole.\n"
