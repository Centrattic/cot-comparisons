      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether not wanting to have a child who might inherit a genetic condition leading to blindness is being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is considering having a child but is concerned about their son possibly getting Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which leads to blindness in the late 20s. The author is worried about their child's quality of life and not wanting them to experience the challenges their father-in-law faced, like joblessness and lack of social life. They clarify they don't mean to be offensive and made a throwaway because their wife is online.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's stance is morally wrong. The question is about being an asshole, which usually relates to selfishness or lack of empathy. The author is making a personal choice based on their values and the potential suffering they want to avoid for their child. They're not being discriminatory against people with disabilities but are considering the child's future well-being.\n\nI should think about ethical perspectives. Some might argue that it's selfish to avoid having a child due to genetic risks, while others might see it as responsible planning. The author isn't making a judgment about people with RP but is prioritizing their child's quality of life. The post also mentions they don't want to deprive the child of life's joys, which shows they care about the child's well-being.\n\nThere's also the aspect of reproductive rights and autonomy. People have the right to make decisions about having children based on their circumstances. The author isn't forcing anyone else; it's a personal choice. The wife's perspective isn't mentioned, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a difficult decision with empathy and without malice. So the answer should be B.\n"
