      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to have a child who could potentially develop Retinitis Pigmentosa, which could lead to blindness in their 20s, especially if it's a boy. The author is concerned about their child missing out on life's joys and examples given include the father, who became blind and lost his job and social life. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making a decision based on their child's potential quality of life. On one hand, it's a personal choice about whether they're willing to bring a child into the world knowing there's a 50% chance of a severe, inherited condition. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to decide against having a child because of a genetic condition, especially if the child might adapt or live a fulfilling life despite the disability.\n\nThe author clarifies they aren't trying to offend or patronize those with disabilities, which is important. They're focusing on the impact of the condition on the child's life, not making judgments about people with disabilities. However, the core issue is the decision to avoid parenthood based on a known genetic risk.\n\nIn terms of societal views, this is a complex area. Some people believe that parents should not be allowed to deny a child the chance to live, even if it's difficult, while others respect the right to make such personal choices. The author isn't forced to have children, so their decision might be seen as a personal choice rather than being in the wrong. However, others might see it as a failure to accept the risks and responsibilities of parenthood.\n\nThe fact that the condition is X-linked (affecting men in the family) is a biological factor here. The author is considering the potential for their son to inherit it, which is a 50% chance. This isn't a guaranteed outcome, but a possibility. The author is weighing the potential hardships against their desire to have children.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the author isn't making a judgment about people living with disabilities but about the specific risks and consequences of the condition. The mention of the grandfather's situation is an example of the possible outcomes they're concerned about.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, the decision to not have a child due to a known genetic risk that could lead to significant hardship isn't inherently wrong. It's a personal choice based on their values and concerns for their child's future. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
