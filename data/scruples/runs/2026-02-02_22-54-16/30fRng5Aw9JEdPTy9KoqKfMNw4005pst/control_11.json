      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong (AITA) for not wanting to have a kid who might develop Retina Pigmentosa (RP), which affects men in the family and could lead to blindness in their late 20s. The person is questioning whether it's selfish to avoid bringing a child into a situation where the kid might face such a severe condition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is worried about their child's quality of life. They mention that their father-in-law, who has RP, has a difficult life without a job or social life. The author is concerned about depriving their child of \"the joys of life,\" which is a valid concern. Parents often consider potential hardships when making decisions about having children, especially regarding genetic conditions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that RP is an inherited condition. The scenario here is that if the child is a boy, there's a 50% chance of inheriting it. The author's stance is about avoiding the risk of their child experiencing blindness later in life. While the author wants to avoid causing their child suffering, there's a debate about whether it's ethical to avoid having a child based on potential genetic risks. Some might argue that the author is making a responsible decision to avoid unnecessary hardship, while others might say that disability doesn't equate to a life without value and that the author is making a judgment about their child's worth.\n\nAdditionally, the author clarifies that they don't intend to be offensive to those with disabilities, which is a good point. It's possible that their concern stems from a place of wanting the best for their child rather than a negative view of people with disabilities. They're considering the practical aspects (like the father-in-law's situation), which could be a realistic assessment of what their child might face.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of reproductive choice. People have the right to make decisions about whether to have children, especially when considering genetic risks. The author isn't discriminating against someone already born but is choosing not to bring a child into a situation with a significant risk of a debilitating condition. This is a personal decision that many parents face with genetic disorders.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being selfish by not considering the possibility of supporting their child through such challenges, using assistive technologies, or the emotional bond that could offset the hardships. However, the author's primary concern is reducing their child's suffering, which is a common parental instinct.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Decisions about reproductive choices, especially involving genetic risks, are complex and personal. The key here is that the author is making a choice based on their understanding of their child's potential quality of life, and while others might have different opinions, it's not inherently unethical or selfish.\n"
