      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to have a child who might develop Retinitis Pigmentosa, which leads to blindness in men by their late 20s. The author's main concern is about depriving the child of life's joys, citing their father's experience of being blind, unemployed, and having no social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is making a personal decision based on potential suffering for the child. They mention not wanting to cause the child hardship, which can be seen as a caring and responsible stance. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory or that people with disabilities can still have fulfilling lives. \n\nBut the key here is the author's intent. They explicitly state they don't want to \"deprive\" the child of life's joys, showing they're not judging the disabled person but the potential hardships. The author also clarifies they aren't being offensive toward people with disabilities. \n\nGenetic conditions can be a factor in family planning. The risk is 50% for male children, so the author is weighing the risks. It's a personal choice about whether to bring a child into a situation with a high probability of a significant health issue. \n\nSociety often respects personal reproductive choices, especially when based on informed consent and concern for the child's well-being. While some might argue that life with a disability has value and that support systems can mitigate challenges, the author's stance is about preventing avoidable suffering. \n\nThe use of a throwaway account and the mention of the wife lurking suggest the author is keeping the discussion private, which is common in such forums. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing the child's potential quality of life over the decision to have a child regardless of the risk. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasoning is based on a desire to prevent suffering, which is a valid personal choice. Unless there's a societal or moral obligation to have children despite genetic risks, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
