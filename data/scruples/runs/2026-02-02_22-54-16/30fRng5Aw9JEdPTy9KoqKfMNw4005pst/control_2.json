      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have a child who might inherit a condition leading to blindness by age 20. The author is a man discussing with his wife about having kids. The wife's family has Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), which affects males, giving each son a 50% chance of going blind in their late 20s. The author is concerned about the child's quality of life, referencing his wife's father who is blind, jobless, and has no social life. He's worried about depriving the child of life's joys and is asking if he's the asshole for not wanting that for his child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a personal decision based on potential future suffering of their child. On one hand, parents often try to avoid putting their children through hardships. On the other hand, some might argue that it's discriminatory to avoid having a child with a disability just because of potential challenges.\n\nThe author clarifies that they don't intend to offend those with disabilities, which is important. They're not dismissing the value of life of someone with RP but are making a difficult choice based on their perception of the child's future. The condition in question here is hereditary, so the decision is about whether to have a son who might inherit it. The father's stance is about wanting to prevent potential suffering, which is a common parental instinct.\n\nHowever, others might argue that parents should accept their children for who they are, regardless of disabilities, and that this decision is a form of eugenics. But the author is considering the specific risk and the quality of life, which is a personal choice. The key here is that the author is making a decision based on their values and information they have about the condition. Since it's a 50% chance for a son, the author is weighing the risks. \n\nThe fact that the author is consulting with their wife and considering the implications shows thoughtfulness. They're not making a snap judgment but are trying to foresee potential issues. The mention of the wife's father's experience adds context to the author's concerns. \n\nBut then again, some might say that the author is not accounting for the possibility that medical advancements could improve outcomes, or that the child could lead a fulfilling life despite the condition. The author's perspective is focused on preventing what they see as a deprived life, but others might see the value in supporting a child regardless of such risks.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a moral dilemma. The author's intention isn't to discriminate but to avoid what they perceive as unnecessary suffering. The answer depends on societal views on disability and reproductive choices. In many places, the right to choose not to have children with potential disabilities is considered a personal decision, not necessarily the \"wrong\" one. However, some might argue that it's the wrong choice because it's based on a fear of challenges rather than acceptance.\n\nGiven all that, the author's position is a difficult but personal choice. The question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author is not acting out of malice or disregard for others with disabilities, and is making a decision based on their understanding of the risks, the answer leans towards \"not in the wrong,\" which is option B.\n"
