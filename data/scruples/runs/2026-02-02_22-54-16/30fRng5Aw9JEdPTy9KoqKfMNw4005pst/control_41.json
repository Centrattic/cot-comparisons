      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to have a child who might inherit a genetic condition causing blindness in their 20s. The author is a man whose wife has a family history of Retinitis Pigmentosa, which affects males. If they have a son, there's a 50% chance he could go blind by his late 20s. The author is questioning if it's selfish not to want a child who might face such a life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical implications. The author is concerned about the quality of life for their potential child. They mention examples like the grandfather being blind and unable to work or socialize. The author isn't dismissing the value of life but is worried about the hardships their child might face. They also clarify they don't mean to offend anyone with disabilities.\n\nNow, considering different perspectives. On one hand, people might argue that the author is making a responsible decision to avoid subjecting their child to unnecessary suffering. Choosing not to have children in such a scenario could be seen as a way to protect the child from a difficult life. On the other hand, others might say that life's value isn't determined by physical abilities and that the author is making a judgment about their child's worth based on a potential condition. They might also argue that support systems can improve the child's quality of life.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. The author isn't outright rejecting people with disabilities but is considering the specific risks and potential hardships. It's a personal choice about family planning, and there's no legal or moral obligation to have children. The post also shows empathy and a desire to avoid causing harm, which is a reasonable stance. The author is making a difficult decision based on the information they have.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"right to life.\" However, in this context, the author is considering whether bringing a child into a life with a significant risk of disability is ethical. Ethical theories like utilitarianism might support avoiding actions that cause suffering. However, others might argue that potential suffering shouldn't be the sole determinant in such decisions.\n\nAlso, the author is being transparent about their feelings and not trying to justify it with harmful stereotypes. They acknowledge their wife's family history and the specific condition, which shows they've done their research. The mention of using a throwaway account because the wife is online might indicate they're aware this is a sensitive topic and want to avoid conflict, but it's not directly relevant to whether they're in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision isn't about discrimination but about personal and ethical considerations regarding their child's future. While it's a tough choice, it's a valid one, and they aren't necessarily in the wrong for making it. The answer would be B, not the asshole.\n"
