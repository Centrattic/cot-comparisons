      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to have a child who might go blind in their 20s due to Retinitis Pigmentosa. Their wife's family has this condition, which affects men, and there's a 50% chance a son would inherit it. The author is worried about the child's quality of life, using their wife's father as an example\u2014blind from the start, unemployed, no social life. They don't want their child to miss out on life's joys, but they clarify they're not trying to offend anyone with disabilities. They also mentioned it's a throwaway in case the wife is checking.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The author is making a personal decision about having children based on a genetic risk. They're concerned about the potential suffering their child might face. But is it wrong to prioritize avoiding future suffering for a child?\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to make reproductive choices. Choosing not to have a child with a genetic condition to prevent suffering could be seen as responsible. On the other, some might argue that disability isn't a fate worse than death, and that life with a disability can still be valuable. The author isn't making a choice after the child is born but before, which is different from euthanasia or other controversial actions.\n\nAlso, the example of the wife's father being unemployed and isolated might be a red herring. Maybe the condition doesn't have to lead to such outcomes. Some people with RP adapt and lead fulfilling lives. The author's assumption that the child would have a worse life might be based on a specific case rather than the possibilities available now with technology and support systems.\n\nBut the author is clear they're not being offensive. They\u2019re considering the child's well-being and their own ability to provide a good life. It's a personal choice, and while others might have different opinions, it doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The key is autonomy in reproductive decisions unless there's direct harm to others, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's their personal decision based on their values and concerns for their child's future, even if others might disagree.\n"
