I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a woman with hearing impairment and APD had a confrontation with a cop. She was walking in a parking lot, turned around because she thought she hadn't locked her truck, which made the cop think she was running away. He approached, grabbed her, and she ended up punching him multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding self-defense. In most places, you can use reasonable force to protect yourself from immediate harm. The key here is whether the force she used was reasonable. She mentions that after the cop grabbed her, she felt threatened and hit him. But then she kept hitting him even after she realized he was a cop. \n\nThe cop had a duty to protect and serve, but he used force that might have been excessive. The parking lot footage showed him handling her roughly, which might indicate he wasn't using proper procedure. But when she hit him after he was already injured, that's where it gets complicated. Even if she was scared, continuing to hit him once he was subdued could be considered excessive force. \n\nHer disability is a factor here. She has a documented auditory processing disorder, which could affect her perception and reaction. However, the law typically doesn't excuse excessive force unless there's a specific legal defense, like if the person was in immediate danger of death or serious harm. \n\nThe fact that she called an ambulance and stayed to help is a positive point, but it doesn't negate the use of excessive force. The outcome was settled out of court, possibly due to the evidence against the police department. But legally, the question remains about whether her actions were justified. \n\nThe author feels morally conflicted because she caused significant injury. While her initial response might be seen as self-defense, the continued attacks after the cop was incapacitated might not be. So, the answer could hinge on the proportionality of force used after the initial assault. If the officer was not posing a further threat, then continuing to hit him would be excessive.\n"
