I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman with hearing impairment who had an altercation with a cop. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person is hearing impaired with APD, which makes understanding speech hard, especially in noisy environments. She was in a parking lot, trying to check if she locked her car. The officer saw her and called out, but she didn't hear him because of the traffic noise. He grabbed her, she panicked, hit him, and kept hitting after the initial punch. The outcome was that the cop had serious injuries, and the case was settled out of court.\n\nSo, the main question is whether her actions were justified. From what I know about self-defense laws, the key factors are imminent threat, proportionality of force, and the person's perception of danger. She was hearing impaired and didn't realize it was a cop initially. Then, when he grabbed her, she thought he might shoot her, so she fought back. She kept hitting after the first punch because she felt he might pull his gun.\n\nBut wait, after the first punch, he was dazed. She saw he was a cop but kept hitting him. That part might be questionable. If he was already incapacitated, continuing to hit him could be considered excessive force. However, she claims she was in fight mode and feared for her life. The fact that there was footage showing the officer handled her roughly might have played into the settlement. Also, her disability likely influenced how the situation was perceived.\n\nBut let's think about the law. In self-defense, you can use force that's necessary to prevent imminent harm. If the officer was trying to subdue her without lethal force, and she escalated by punching him, maybe she crossed a line. However, given her disability and the situation, her perception of threat might be considered valid. Also, the article mentions that the police department would have had a bad public image, which might imply that her side had some legal backing.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong because of her disability and the circumstances. But legally, after the initial attack, if the officer wasn't using deadly force, hitting him five more times might be excessive. However, if she genuinely believed he was going to use lethal force, then it could be justified. It's a bit of a gray area, but considering the officer's rough handling and her fear, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, hitting him multiple times after he was dazed might be overkill. But given the fear of being shot, maybe it's still justified. The fact that the case was settled out of court and the officer apologized might also suggest that the author wasn't at fault. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
