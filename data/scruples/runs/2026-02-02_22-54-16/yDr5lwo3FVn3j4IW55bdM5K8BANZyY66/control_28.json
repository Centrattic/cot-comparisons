I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a hearing-impaired woman (24f) had an altercation with a cop. She has APD, which affects her ability to process sounds. She was walking in a parking lot, went back to check her truck, and the officer saw her, called out, but she didn't notice. He approached, grabbed her, and she punched him multiple times, causing serious injuries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider self-defense laws. Generally, self-defense is justified if someone reasonably believes they are in danger. The key here is whether her belief was reasonable. She mentions she was terrified and thought he might shoot her. The cop had already grabbed her and pinned her against the truck. If the force used by the officer was excessive, then her response might be justified. But if his actions were within protocol, then her use of force could be excessive.\n\nHer disabilities play a role. She couldn't hear the officer calling her, which is important. The APD and hearing impairment might affect her ability to perceive the situation accurately. If she genuinely didn't realize he was a cop until after the first punch, that could be a factor. But she did hit him five more times after realizing. That seems like a problem. Even if she was scared, continuing to hit someone who's already incapacitated (he slumped after the first punch) might cross into excessive force, especially if there's no immediate threat.\n\nThe outcome: she caused serious injuries leading to his early retirement. She called an ambulance and stayed to help, which shows some responsibility. The case was settled out of court, possibly due to the officer's rough handling in the footage. He later apologized, which might indicate he saw his actions as contributing.\n\nMoral conflict is present. The user feels bad about overdoing it. Legally, it's about proportionality. If the officer's initial force was unjustified, her response might be justified. But once he's down, continuing to hit him isn't defense. So maybe she's at fault for the additional hits. Also, even in fear, there's a duty to cease once the threat is neutralized.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if someone mistakes an officer for a threat, that's a factor. But the officer was in uniform, so that might count against her. However, her disability could be a mitigating factor. The key is whether her actions were necessary. The first punch could be self-defense, but the rest might not be.\n\nSo legally, she might be in the wrong for the excessive force after the first punch. Morally, it's complicated but her intent to stop the threat might mitigate some blame. However, the question is about being an asshole (AITA), which is more about social judgment. Since she felt fear and acted out of self-defense, but overdid it, the answer might lean towards her being in the wrong for the continued attacks.\n"
