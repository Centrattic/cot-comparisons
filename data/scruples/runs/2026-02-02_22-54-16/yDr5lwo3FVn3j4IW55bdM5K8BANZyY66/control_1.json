I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the woman, who is hearing impaired with APD, was in a parking lot. She was walking towards her truck but had to go back because her keyfob didn't lock the car. The cop saw her and thought she was running away, so he chased her, grabbed her, and pinned her against the truck. She then punched him multiple times, leading to serious injuries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider self-defense laws. In many places, you can use reasonable force to protect yourself if you believe you're in danger. The key here is whether she genuinely believed she was in imminent danger when she hit him. She mentions she was terrified and thought he might shoot her after she punched him. Once he was injured and slumped against the tailgate, did she have a reason to keep hitting him? If he wasn't actively threatening her anymore, continuing to hit him might be excessive.\n\nAlso, she was aware he was a cop after the initial punch. Did she have a duty to stop? Usually, once the threat is neutralized (like the officer is incapacitated), using more force could be considered excessive. She kept hitting him five more times. That seems like overkill unless there was an ongoing threat. The fact that she called an ambulance afterward shows she didn't want to harm him further, but the initial fear might have escalated.\n\nHer hearing impairment complicates things. If she didn't hear the officer's commands and was in a stressful situation, her reaction might be more understandable. However, even with her disability, the use of force after the officer was subdued could still be excessive. The outcome (his memory issues and early retirement) is a factor too. The resolution out of court and the officer's private apology might indicate that the legal system saw some mitigating factors, but the moral question remains.\n\nSo, balancing her justified fear in the initial attack and the excessive force afterward, she might be in the wrong for continuing to hit him once he was already incapacitated. But maybe the initial self-defense part wasn't her fault. The main issue is the continuation of the assault after the threat had likely ended. Therefore, the answer could be A (she's in the wrong for the additional hits) but not entirely for the first punch. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong overall. Since the user asks specifically about continuing to hit him after realizing he was a cop and injured, the answer leans towards A.\n"
