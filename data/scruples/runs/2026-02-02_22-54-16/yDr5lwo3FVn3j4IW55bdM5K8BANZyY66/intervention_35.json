I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by going through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and APD, which makes understanding speech difficult, especially in noisy environments. She was in a Walmart parking lot, trying to check if she locked her truck. The officer saw her turn and run, which he probably took as fleeing. She didn't notice him because of the noise and her condition.\n\nWhen the officer approached, he called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear him. He then grabbed her arm and pinned her against the truck. She felt threatened and hit him. After the initial punch, she kept hitting him five more times. The result was serious injuries for the officer, including a concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket. She called an ambulance and stayed to help, though.\n\nThe situation went to a private settlement. The police department had footage of the officer handling her roughly, and her disability made it look bad for the department. The officer later apologized. The author is conflicted about whether she was justified in her actions, especially since she caused more harm than necessary out of fear.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break down the legal and moral aspects.\n\nLegally, self-defense often requires that the force used is proportional to the threat. If the officer was trying to detain her and she felt threatened, there's a line between defending oneself and escalating the situation. The initial punch might be seen as self-defense if she feared immediate harm. However, continuing to hit him after he was already subdued (he slumped against the tailgate) could be considered excessive force. Even if she feared for her life, once the threat is neutralized, continuing to attack might not be justified.\n\nMoral perspective: The author's actions were driven by fear and her disability. She might have genuinely believed the officer was a threat, especially given the rough handling. However, causing serious injury beyond what was necessary to stop the threat could be seen as morally wrong. The fact that she had the chance to stop but kept hitting him suggests that her actions went beyond self-defense.\n\nAlso, the outcome: the officer retired early with memory issues. Even if the officer was at fault for rough handling, the author's excessive use of force led to significant harm. The apology from the officer might indicate he acknowledged his part, but it doesn't absolve her of responsibility for her actions.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if someone is lawfully detaining you and you use force against them, it's not considered self-defense. The officer was acting within his duty to stop her, even if his method was rough. Her response was not proportionate. The key issue is whether her fear was reasonable. Given her hearing difficulties and the poor lighting, her perception of the threat might be considered, but once the officer was down, continuing the assault isn't justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, legally and morally, the author might be in the wrong because she escalated the situation beyond what was necessary for self-defense. The initial punch could be seen as a reaction to fear, but the continued attacks were excessive. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
