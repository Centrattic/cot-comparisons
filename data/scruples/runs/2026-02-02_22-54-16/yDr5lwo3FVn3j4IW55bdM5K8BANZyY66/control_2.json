I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a woman with hearing impairment and APD who ended up punching a cop multiple times. I need to evaluate the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the woman has a legitimate disability that affects her ability to process sounds, which is important. She didn't hear the officer calling her, which led to a misunderstanding. The officer approached her, grabbed her arm, and pinned her against her truck. She felt threatened, especially considering the context of being in a dark parking lot and the possibility of being shot. Her reaction was to punch him, which is a form of self-defense. But she continued hitting him even after realizing he was a cop and had already been injured.\n\nThe key points here are her state of fear and the officer's use of force. The officer's actions\u2014grabbing her and pinning her\u2014could be seen as aggressive. However, he was a police officer responding to someone he thought was fleeing, which might be part of his job. The woman's APD is a mitigating factor because it impaired her ability to understand the situation. But even so, once she realized it was a cop and he was injured, continuing to hit him multiple times might be excessive.\n\nThe outcome was settled out of court, partly because the footage showed the officer handling her roughly. That suggests that the officer might have overstepped in his approach. However, the woman's use of force after the initial punch is questionable. She admitted to hitting him more times out of fear of being shot, but once he was already incapacitated, continuing to attack could be considered unnecessary and excessive.\n\nIn terms of legal self-defense, the principle is that the force used must be proportional to the threat. If the officer had a gun and was threatening her, her actions might be justified. However, the description says he was slumped against the tailgate after the first punch. If he was no longer a threat (not pointing a gun, not actively attacking), continuing to hit him might not be justified. However, given her trauma and fear, her actions might be seen as a panic response.\n\nMorally, the user is conflicted because she caused significant harm. She called an ambulance and helped until it arrived, which shows responsibility. But the question is about whether she was in the wrong. Legally, it's complicated with the video evidence and her disability. Ethically, some might argue she acted in self-defense, but others might say that once the officer was down, she should have stopped. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer isn't straightforward. However, since she continued to hit him even after he was injured and she realized he was a cop, which led to more serious injuries, it's possible she overstepped in her self-defense. But given the officer's initial rough handling and her disability, it's a nuanced situation. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I'm leaning towards A because the excessive force after the initial threat might be the wrong choice, even if the initial action was self-defense.\n"
