I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (24f) was in the wrong when she punched a cop more than necessary. \n\nFirst, the context: She's hearing impaired with APD. She didn't hear the cop approaching. She turned around because she was checking if she locked her car, not because she saw a cop. The cop followed her, grabbed her arm, pinned her against the truck, and then she hit back in self-defense.\n\nThe key points here are self-defense laws. In many jurisdictions, self-defense applies when someone reasonably believes they're in danger. She mentions she was terrified, thought he might shoot her after punching him. She hit him five more times even after seeing he was a cop. But she also called an ambulance and stayed to help.\n\nThe cop used excessive force by grabbing and pinning her, which probably contributed to her fear. The parking lot footage showed he handled her roughly, which might explain why the case was settled out of court. \n\nBut the question is about whether she was in the wrong. The fact that she kept hitting him after he was down could be an issue. However, considering her disability and the fear of being shot, some might argue it's understandable. But legally, self-defense might require proportionality. Hitting someone after they're incapacitated could be seen as excessive.\n\nHowever, the user's stance is that she's not in the wrong. The cop's initial action was aggressive, and her response might be justified as self-defense. Also, the settlement out of court and his later apology might indicate that the situation was not entirely her fault. The fact that she had a valid reason (disability) and the cop's actions contributed to the conflict might support her side.\n\nBut the part where she kept hitting him even after seeing he was a cop is tricky. Some might say she should have stopped once she realized he was a cop, but given the circumstances (fear of being shot), it's a gray area. \n\nIn conclusion, considering her disability, the cop's rough handling, and the fear of being shot, it's possible she wasn't in the wrong. But legally, the repeated hits could be debated. However, the answer might lean towards B (not the wrong) because the cop's actions were at fault and her response was a reaction to perceived immediate danger.\n"
