I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after punching a cop. The situation involves a hearing-impaired person who had an APD, leading to communication issues.\n\nFirst, the cop approached the woman in a poorly lit parking lot. She didn't notice him initially because of her hearing issues. When he tried to stop her, she didn't hear him. Then, he grabbed her arm and pinned her against her truck. She reacted violently, fearing for her life, which led to multiple punches, causing serious injury.\n\nThe key points here are self-defense and the author's disability. The woman had a legitimate fear of being shot, especially after the cop grabbed her. Her reaction might be justified under self-defense laws, which typically allow for the use of force to prevent imminent harm. However, the question is whether continuing to hit the officer after he was slumped over was necessary.\n\nThe author mentions she hit him five more times after the initial punch. Even though she feared the officer might pull his gun, if he was already incapacitated (slumped against the tailgate), continuing to hit him could be seen as excessive. Self-defense usually requires that the force used is proportional to the threat. If the officer was no longer an immediate threat, the additional punches might be considered unnecessary.\n\nAlso, the outcome was settled out of court due to the officer's rough handling of her, and he later apologized. The fact that the officer was at fault in his approach could mitigate the author's responsibility. However, the woman's actions beyond the first punch might cross into excessive force, especially considering the officer's injuries were severe.\n\nBut considering her disability and the fact that she was in a high-stress, fear-driven situation, some might argue that her actions were a reasonable response given her impaired perception of the situation. The law often takes into account the individual's state of mind and disabilities when assessing self-defense claims.\n\nIn the end, the moral conflict lies in whether her continued actions were necessary. Legally, it's a gray area, but from an ethical standpoint, the author might feel she was wrong to inflict more harm than necessary. However, given the circumstances, especially her disability and the officer's initial aggression, it's debatable.\n"
