I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is hearing impaired with APD, which affects their ability to process sounds. They were in a Walmart parking lot, walking away from their car, then turned back to check if they locked it. The cop saw this and thought they were running away. The cop called out, but the person couldn't hear due to the noise and their condition. The cop grabbed them, they panicked, and punched the cop multiple times, causing serious injuries.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the legal aspects. In self-defense, there's usually a requirement that the person reasonably believed they were in danger. Since the author mentioned they were terrified and in fight mode, maybe that's part of their defense. However, they knew the cop was a cop after the first punch but kept hitting. That's a bit tricky. If they had reason to believe the cop would use lethal force, maybe their actions are justified, but hitting five more times after the cop is slumped against the tailgate might be excessive. \n\nThe person's disability is a key factor here. APD would make it hard to process the cop's warning. The cop used force, which in some jurisdictions might be considered excessive, especially if the person didn't know the cop was present. The cop grabbing and pinning someone in a parking lot might not be justified if the person wasn't threatening. The parking lot footage showing the cop handling them roughly could indicate that the initial use of force was unwarranted, which might support the person's self-defense claim.\n\nBut then, even if the cop was being rough, the response of hitting multiple times leading to serious injuries might cross into unnecessary violence. The author mentions they hit him five more times after the initial punch, which could be seen as over-the-top if the threat level had decreased once the cop was down. However, the fear of being shot might have been a real concern, leading to a prolonged defensive response.\n\nAlso, the outcome was settled out of court, possibly considering the cop's rough handling. The author called an ambulance, which shows responsibility. The cop's private apology might indicate that the police department had some wrongdoing here. \n\nBut the author's own remorse and the fact that they stopped after the cop was down (and then called for help) might mitigate the blame. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. Legally, self-defense can be a defense, but the excessiveness of hitting five times after the initial punch is questionable. Morally, they might feel they were protecting themselves, but causing memory issues and early retirement is a heavy consequence. \n\nIn some legal systems, self-defense requires proportionality. If the threat is neutralized, continuing to attack could be seen as assault. The person's disability might affect how the situation is judged, but the actions after the cop was down might still be considered excessive. So, depending on jurisdiction, the author could be seen as in the wrong for the excessive force, even if the initial act was self-defense. However, given the fear and panic, there's a gray area. The answer might hinge on the specifics of self-defense laws in their area, but since the user is asking for a general opinion, I have to weigh the fear and disability against the excessiveness of the response.\n"
