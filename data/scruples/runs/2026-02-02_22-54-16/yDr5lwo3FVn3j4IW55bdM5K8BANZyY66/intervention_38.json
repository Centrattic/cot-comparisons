I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for punching a cop more than necessary. The situation involves a hearing-impaired individual who had a misunderstanding with a police officer.\n\nFirst, the author has a disability (APD) that affects their hearing. They were in a poorly lit parking lot, which might have contributed to the officer misinterpreting their actions. The officer approached and grabbed the author, which led to a physical altercation. The key points here are self-defense and the proportionality of the force used.\n\nThe author mentions they hit the officer multiple times after the initial punch. The officer was a cop, and there's footage showing he handled her roughly. The legal settlement was out of court, which might indicate that the situation was resolved without criminal charges, possibly due to the officer's conduct being in question.\n\nMorally, the author feels conflicted about causing significant injury. They called an ambulance and stayed to help, which shows responsibility. However, hitting someone multiple times to the head, even in self-defense, could be seen as excessive. The law often considers whether the force used is reasonable given the threat. If the officer was already subdued or not an immediate threat, continued attacks might be deemed unnecessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate fear of being shot, which might justify their reaction. The officer's initial rough handling could have escalated the situation. The disability also plays a role, as the author's impairment might have affected their perception and reaction.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral judgment, the situation is complex. The officer's actions might have contributed to the escalation. However, using force beyond what's needed to defend oneself can be problematic. The answer depends on whether the author's actions were proportionate and necessary to prevent harm. Given the details, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a gray area regarding excessive force.\n"
