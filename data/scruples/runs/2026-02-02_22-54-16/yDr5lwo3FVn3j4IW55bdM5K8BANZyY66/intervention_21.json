I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a hearing-impaired person who had a confrontation with a police officer.\n\nFirst, the author has Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which makes it hard for them to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. They didn't hear the officer calling them when he approached. This is a key point because their disability could have affected their perception of the situation.\n\nThe officer saw the woman turning away and jogging back towards her truck. From his perspective, it might look like she was fleeing or acting suspiciously. But the woman didn't realize there was an officer nearby. When he caught up and grabbed her, she felt threatened. She mentions being in \"fight mode\" because she was scared he might shoot her if she hit him.\n\nSelf-defense is a big factor here. She punched him once when he grabbed her, which could be justified as self-defense. However, she continued hitting him five more times after he was already slumped against the tailgate. She was aware he was a cop and had already injured him, but she kept attacking out of fear he might pull his gun. The question is whether that continued attack was necessary.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, self-defense allows for proportionate force to stop an immediate threat. Once the officer was incapacitated, continuing to hit him might not be justified if the threat had stopped. The officer had a duty to protect the public, so using excessive force against him could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's disability and the chaotic environment might mitigate her responsibility. Her APD made it impossible to hear the officer, leading to a misunderstanding. The fact that the officer was handling her roughly and there was footage showing this could explain why she felt threatened.\n\nHowever, the aftermath shows that the officer did retire with injuries. The author's continued attacks beyond the initial self-defense response might be seen as excessive. Even if she was scared, once the officer was down, the threat might have been neutralized. Hitting him multiple times after he was already incapacitated could be considered excessive force, regardless of her fear.\n\nAlso, the fact that she later called an ambulance and took responsibility might show remorse, but it doesn't negate the legal aspect. The key issue is whether her actions were proportionate. The initial punch could be self-defense, but the five additional hits might be over the line.\n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author's disability is a mitigating factor, but the continued attacks after the threat was potentially neutralized could be seen as excessive. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the excessive force. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to her disability and the officer's rough handling. But legally, the use of force has to be proportionate, so A might be the more accurate answer.\n"
