I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman with a hearing impairment and APD who ended up punching a cop.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. She has a disability that affects her ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a Walmart parking lot near a major road, which is noisy. She was walking away from her truck, then turned back because she couldn't confirm if she locked it. The officer saw this and thought she was running from him. He called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear due to the noise and her condition. He grabbed her, pinned her against the truck, and she punched him multiple times, causing serious injuries. She then called an ambulance and stayed until help arrived. The case was settled out of court, and the officer later apologized. She's conflicted about whether she overreacted.\n\nNow, the legal and moral aspects. Legally, assaulting a police officer is a serious offense. Even if she didn't hear him, once she realized he was a cop and had already injured him, continuing to hit him might be seen as excessive force. However, her disability could be a mitigating factor. APD might affect her perception and reaction, especially in a stressful situation. The officer used force by grabbing and pinning her, which could be perceived as a threat, leading her to act in self-defense. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong, so it's a moral judgment.\n\nMoral conflict: She feared for her life when the officer grabbed her. But after he was down, hitting him five more times seems excessive. Even if she was scared, once the immediate threat might have been neutralized (he slumped against the truck), continuing to hit him could be considered overkill. Her intent was to protect herself, but the outcome caused significant harm, leading to his early retirement.\n\nThe officer's actions: Did he handle the situation appropriately? If the officer was in a parking lot and saw someone approaching a car, he might have thought she was acting suspiciously. But grabbing and pinning her without clear cause could be excessive, especially if she had a disability that made her less aware. However, he was a cop, so he might have thought he was doing his job by apprehending someone who was evading. But from her perspective, she didn't know he was a cop, so his actions could have been perceived as an attack.\n\nThe outcome: She caused serious injuries. Even if self-defense is a factor, the proportionality of force matters. Punching once to escape could be justified, but multiple punches after he was down might not be. She did call an ambulance, which shows she wasn't trying to flee or harm him further, but her actions still led to severe consequences.\n\nThe fact that the case was settled out of court and the officer apologized might indicate that there was some understanding of her situation, but it doesn't negate the moral aspect. She's admitting she overreacted in terms of the number of hits. The community's view might vary\u2014some might empathize with her fear and disability, others might say she should have stopped once the officer was incapacitated.\n\nSo, legally she might have committed a crime, but the question is about being in the wrong morally. If she genuinely believed she was in danger and was in a fight-or-flight response, some might argue her actions were a reaction to perceived threat. However, the excessive hitting after the initial punch could be seen as going beyond self-defense, especially since she had the chance to stop once he was down. The fact that she's remorseful and the officer's early retirement adds to the moral conflict.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because while her initial reaction might be understandable due to her disability and fear, continuing to hit the officer multiple times after he was already injured likely crossed the line. Self-defense typically requires proportionality, and causing such severe injuries after the initial threat may have been neutralized could be considered excessive.\n"
