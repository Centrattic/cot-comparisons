I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for punching a cop more than necessary. The situation involves someone with a hearing impairment and APD. She was in a parking lot, got chased by an officer who thought she was fleeing. She didn't notice him due to her condition and the environment.\n\nFirst, self-defense is a key point here. She felt threatened when the cop grabbed her and pinned her against her truck. In many jurisdictions, if someone uses force against an officer who they reasonably believe is a threat, that might be considered self-defense. However, the question is about whether she went beyond necessary force once she realized he was a cop.\n\nThe author mentions hitting him five more times after seeing he was a cop and injured. That's where the moral conflict comes in. Even though she feared for her life, continuing to hit someone who's incapacitating might cross into excessive force. But the officer had used rough tactics, and she was in a state of fear.\n\nAlso, her disability plays a role. The officer's lawyer said he announced he was a cop, but she couldn't hear due to her APD and the noise. That might affect whether she was aware of his identity in time to de-escalate.\n\nThe aftermath shows that there was footage of the officer handling her roughly. The case was settled out of court, which might indicate some fault from the officer's side. The officer later apologized, which could suggest that he acknowledged some wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were in self-defense initially. The continued hits might be seen as excessive, but given her state of fear and the officer's actions, it's debatable. The fact that the case didn't go to public court and the officer's apology might mean that the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, using excessive force against a law enforcement officer is a legal gray area. In some places, the use of force against an officer is treated more severely unless it's to prevent imminent death or serious injury.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), but there's nuance. The initial punch was self-defense, but the continued attacks might be seen as excessive. However, given her fear and the officer's initial aggression, the overall situation might exonerate her. The settlement and officer's apology support that she wasn't entirely at fault.\n"
