I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and APD got into an altercation with a cop. She was walking in a parking lot, didn't notice the officer, turned to check her truck, and the officer thought she was running away. He approached her, grabbed her arm, she punched him multiple times, causing injury. She later called an ambulance and supported his neck. The case was settled out of court, and the officer apologized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Self-defense laws vary by jurisdiction, but generally, someone can use reasonable force to protect themselves if they believe they're in danger. The woman feared being shot, so she might have felt justified in using force. However, after the initial punch, she hit him five more times. Even if she felt threatened, hitting an officer who is trying to subdue her beyond what's necessary could be considered excessive force. \n\nThe officer did grab her arm and pinned her against the truck, which might be considered rough handling. The video footage showed that the police department handled her roughly, which could indicate that his actions were not entirely justified. Her disability also plays a role here; if she couldn't process the officer's commands due to her APD, that complicates understanding the threat level.\n\nBut here's the conflict: even if she had a valid reason to punch him once, continuing to hit him after he was already injured and slumped against the truck might be overkill. She mentions she hit him five more times after the initial punch, which caused significant injury. Legally, once the threat is neutralized, using more force could be seen as assault. Morally, it's about whether her fear justified the continued violence. She felt she was in danger, but the officer wasn't armed at that point. It's possible that she overreacted out of fear, especially since she later realized he was a cop and stopped. \n\nAlso, the fact that she called an ambulance and stayed to help is a mitigating factor. However, the outcome was severe for the officer, leading to memory issues and early retirement. The author feels bad about it, which shows remorse, but the question is whether she was in the wrong. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, using force against a police officer, even in self-defense, is treated more seriously. If the officer was acting within his duty, the woman's response might be considered excessive. The officer did try to detain her, and while his method was rough, punching someone in the head multiple times is generally not considered reasonable. \n\nBut the key point is the proportionality of the force. The initial punch might be self-defense, but the five additional hits might not be. So, the author might be in the wrong for continuing to hit him after the initial threat was addressed, even if her fear was real. Her disability might be a factor in how the law views her actions, but the excessive force could still make her responsible.\n"
