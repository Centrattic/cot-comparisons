I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for punching a cop more than necessary. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a hearing impairment and APD, which makes processing sounds hard. This is a key factor because it explains why she didn't hear the officer. The officer saw her turning towards her truck and might have thought she was fleeing, leading him to approach.\n\nShe was in a poorly lit parking lot, near a busy road with lots of noise. She was returning to check if she locked her truck. The officer approached, grabbed her arm, pinned her against the truck. She felt terrified and hit him, then kept hitting out of fear he might pull a gun. The aftermath shows she called an ambulance and stayed to help.\n\nLegally, using force against someone who uses excessive force might be justified. She was in a situation where she felt her life was in danger. Her disability adds context\u2014she couldn't process the officer's commands due to her condition. The fact that there's footage showing the officer handled her roughly supports her side.\n\nThe officer later apologized, and the case was settled out of court. The author feels morally conflicted because she caused serious injury. But she acted out of fear, not malice. Considering self-defense laws, which protect against imminent threat, her actions might be justified. The key here is whether her fear was reasonable. Given the situation\u2014being pinned by a cop at night in a parking lot\u2014her fear of being shot seems plausible.\n\nShe did stop to help after the fact, which shows she didn't have malicious intent. The outcome for the officer was severe, but she wasn't trying to harm him beyond what she thought necessary. So, morally, she might not be in the wrong because her actions were a response to perceived immediate danger. Also, her disabilities contributed to the misunderstanding. The answer would be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
