I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for punching a cop more than necessary. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author has a hearing impairment and APD, which makes understanding speech difficult, especially in noisy environments. That's a key point because it might affect how she perceived the situation. She was walking in a parking lot, trying to check if her truck was locked. The cop saw her and called out, but she didn't hear him due to the traffic noise. When the cop approached and grabbed her, she panicked and hit him, not realizing he was a cop initially. Then, even after realizing he was a cop, she hit him multiple more times out of fear of being shot.\n\nNow, the legal and moral aspects come into play. Legally, even if she was in fear, hitting a police officer is a serious offense. The fact that she was hearing impaired might be a mitigating factor, but it's not an excuse for excessive force. However, the situation seems to involve a misunderstanding. She didn't know he was a cop at first, which might be a defense. But once she realized he was a cop and still attacked him, that complicates things. She continued hitting him after he was already subdued, which could be seen as assault beyond self-defense.\n\nMorally, she felt conflicted about causing so much harm. The cop ended up with serious injuries and had to retire. She called an ambulance, which shows some accountability. The situation was settled out of court, possibly because the footage showed the cop's rough handling and her disability. The cop later apologized, which might suggest that his actions contributed to the escalation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were in self-defense initially due to the cop's aggressive behavior and her fear. However, continuing to hit him after he was subdued might be considered excessive. But given her disability and the fear of being shot, it's a nuanced case. Legally, she might be in the wrong for the additional hits, but morally, there's context. The answer depends on whether the continued attacks were justified. Since she was in a heightened state of fear and panic, maybe it's not entirely her fault. But the key is that once the threat was neutralized, further hits could be seen as unprovoked. So, it's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for the excessive force after the initial punch.\n"
