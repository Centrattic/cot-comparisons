I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) in the situation where she punched a cop multiple times. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is hearing impaired with APD, which affects how she processes sounds. That's a key point. She was walking in a parking lot, trying to check if she locked her truck. The officer saw her and thought she was running away, so he called out and grabbed her. She didn't hear him, didn't realize he was a cop, and when he grabbed her, she panicked and hit him. She then hit him multiple times even after seeing he was a cop and injured him.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Her hearing impairment and APD affecting her perception, 2) The officer's use of force (grabbing and pinning her), 3) Her response with excessive force despite the situation de-escalating after the first punch.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong for continuing to hit him even after he was already injured. Legal aspects aside, the moral aspect is about her actions when she realized he was a cop. She knew she could have been shot, so she hit more times. But she also called an ambulance and supported his neck afterward. The outcome was settled out of court, and the cop later apologized.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, she acted out of fear due to her disability and the situation. But after the initial attack, continuing to hit someone who was already subdued (after the first punch made him slump) might be seen as excessive. However, her disability and the officer's initial rough handling could be mitigating factors. The fact that she followed up with care (calling ambulance) shows she didn't want to harm him beyond self-defense. The cop's apology also suggests he acknowledged his part in the incident.\n\nSo, considering all points, while her initial reaction might be understandable given her fear and disability, hitting him multiple times after he was already down might cross into being in the wrong. But there's also context of her disability and the officer's actions. It's a bit of a gray area, but the main issue is her continued attacks after the threat level decreased. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but not entirely clear. However, the user's own feelings of guilt and the outcome suggest it's not a straightforward case. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just legal. Morally, continuing to hit even if in fear after the officer was down could be seen as excessive, so A might be the answer.\n"
