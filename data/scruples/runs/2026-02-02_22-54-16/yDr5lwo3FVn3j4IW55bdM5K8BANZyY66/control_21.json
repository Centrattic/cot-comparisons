I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for punching a cop. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the author has a hearing impairment and APD, which affects how they process sounds. That's a key point here. When she was in the parking lot, she didn't hear the officer. She turned around because she was checking her truck, not fleeing. The officer probably saw her turning away and thought she was running from him, leading him to approach her.\n\nThe officer grabbed her arm and pinned her against the truck. She yanked free and punched him. She felt threatened because he could have shot her after she hit him. Then, even after realizing he was a cop, she hit him five more times. The result was serious injuries to the officer, including a concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: self-defense. In many jurisdictions, self-defense allows the use of force to protect oneself from imminent harm. However, the force must be reasonable. The initial punch when she felt restrained might be justified if she believed she was in danger. But hitting him five more times after he was slumped against the tailgate might be excessive, especially once she realized he was a cop and not an attacker.\n\nAlso, the fact that there was footage showing the officer handled her roughly could support her side. Her disability might also be a factor in how the situation was perceived. However, her continued attacks after the officer was down could be seen as unnecessary, even if she was in fear.\n\nMorally, she feels conflicted because she caused more harm than necessary. The officer later apologized, which might indicate he recognized his own misconduct. But legally, the question is whether her response was proportionate. If the officer's force was unjustified, her initial reaction might be okay, but the follow-up hits might not be.\n\nIn some places, the use of force in self-defense can be a defense, but if the threat is no longer present, further violence might be considered assault. Since the officer was already subdued, her continued attacks could be seen as excessive.\n\nSo, considering all factors: her disability, the officer's initial rough handling, her fear, but the excessive force she used after the threat was neutralized. The answer might lean towards A (she's in the wrong) because the repeated punches after he was down were likely unnecessary. But there's also context about her fear and disability. However, legally, once the officer was down, continuing to hit him could be excessive. So, the answer might be A.\n"
