I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author has a hearing impairment and an Auditory Processing Disorder. This affects their ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. That's a crucial point because it explains why she might not have heard the officer when he called out to her.\n\nThe scenario is a parking lot where she's walking towards her truck, then turns back to double-check she locked it. The officer, seeing her turn away and jog back, probably assumed she was fleeing. He called out, but she didn't hear due to her APD. He then approached, grabbed her arm, and pinned her against the truck. She felt threatened, broke free, and hit him. After the initial punch, she hit him five more times, causing significant injuries.\n\nNow, the key legal and moral questions here. Legally, using force against a police officer can be tricky. Even if you feel threatened, the law typically expects you to disengage once you realize the officer's identity. However, the woman's disability might have impaired her ability to perceive the threat correctly. She didn't hear the officer until after he grabbed her. At that point, she might have believed he was a threat, leading her to act in self-defense.\n\nBut then she continued hitting him after realizing he was a cop. That's where the moral conflict comes in. If she had already caused him to slump, maybe she perceived an ongoing threat. But if the officer was subdued and not posing a threat, continuing to attack could be excessive. However, in the moment, her fear of being shot might have driven her actions. The officer later apologized, and there was footage showing he handled her roughly. The settlement out of court suggests some legal leniency due to the circumstances.\n\nMoral standpoint: She was in fear for her life, which can justify self-defense. But causing severe injury after the initial threat might be excessive. However, her disability complicates things because it's a mitigating factor in her ability to process the situation correctly. Her remorse and calling an ambulance also show she didn't intend harm beyond self-defense.\n\nSo, considering her disability, the officer's rough handling, her fear, and the fact that the situation was settled without public court, there's a balance between self-defense and excessive force. The answer depends on whether the continued attacks after the initial punch were necessary. Given that she feared for her life and the officer was acting aggressively, her actions might be seen as justified in the moment, though morally, she feels conflicted. However, legally, hitting a cop even in self-defense can lead to charges. Since the question is about being in the wrong morally, her disability and the circumstances might mean she's not the asshole. But if the continued attacks were unnecessary after she realized he was a cop, she might be in the wrong. The fact that she kept hitting after he was down is a point against her, but her fear of being shot is a mitigating factor.\n"
