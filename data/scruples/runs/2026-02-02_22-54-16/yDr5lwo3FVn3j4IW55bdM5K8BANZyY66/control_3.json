I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a woman with hearing impairment and APD got into a confrontation with a cop. She was walking in a parking lot, trying to check her truck, and the cop thought she was running away. The officer tried to grab her, she punched him multiple times, causing serious injury, and she's now feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In self-defense, there's usually a requirement to reasonably believe that you're in danger. The woman claims she didn't hear the officer, assumed the worst, and reacted. Since she has a disability affecting her hearing, that might influence what she could reasonably perceive. If the officer grabbed her and pinned her against the truck, maybe she felt restrained, which could trigger a self-defense response. However, the officer was a law enforcement officer, which complicates things. Law enforcement officers have authority, but if they use excessive force, that could affect self-defense claims.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The woman hit the officer multiple times after the first punch. Even if the first punch was a reaction to being grabbed, continuing to hit him after he slumped over might be seen as excessive. She acknowledges that she hit him more than necessary and feels bad about the injuries he sustained. The fact that she eventually called an ambulance and helped him suggests there was no intent to harm beyond self-defense, but the number of hits could be seen as overkill.\n\nAlso, the outcome was settled out of court, possibly due to the officer's rough handling being on camera. The officer later apologized, which might indicate he used too much force, supporting her claim of self-defense. But the key point is whether her response was proportional. If she felt threatened with a gun, hitting back might be justified, but continuing after the officer was down might not be.\n\nAnother angle is the societal context. She mentions being a \"tiny white lady\" which might have influenced how the police reacted. Police are less likely to use lethal force against women, but the situation was in a parking lot at night, which could lead to different assumptions. Her disability also plays a role in her perception of events, which might mean her fear was genuine even if the officer's actions were misinterpreted.\n\nIn summary, legally and morally, it's a gray area. She had a legitimate reason to fear for her safety due to the officer's actions and her own hearing issues. However, the continued attacks after the initial strike could be seen as excessive. The settlement and apology suggest some fault on the officer's part, but the woman's actions also went beyond what might be necessary self-defense. So, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's a part where she could have stopped once the threat was neutralized.\n"
