I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after punching a cop multiple times. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a hearing impairment and APD, which makes it hard to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. That's a key factor here. When the officer approached, the parking lot was poorly lit and near a busy road with lots of noise. The author didn't hear the officer because of the environment and her condition. She turned to check her truck, which the officer misinterpreted as running away. \n\nThe officer then grabbed her and pinned her against her truck. The author felt threatened, leading her to punch him. The question is whether she was justified in continuing to hit him after he was already injured. \n\nNow, self-defense laws vary, but generally, you can only use as much force as necessary to protect yourself. If the officer had her pinned, was he still a threat? If he wasn't using a weapon and just had a hold of her, maybe she overreacted by continuing to hit him after he was incapacitated. The fact that she hit him five more times after he slumped over suggests that the threat might have been neutralized, so continuing to hit him could be excessive.\n\nAlso, the officer was on duty. Even if he used rough tactics, she might have had other options, like trying to explain her disability or calling for help. However, given her fear of being shot, her reaction might be understandable if she felt there was no other way to defend herself. But once the officer was down, continuing the attack could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nThe settlement out of court and the officer's later apology might affect public perception, but legally, the key is whether her actions were proportionate. She caused serious injury, which might be beyond what's necessary for self-defense. \n\nSo, considering all that, she might be in the wrong because she continued to hit him when he was already down and not actively threatening her anymore. But there's also the context of her disability and fear. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The answer might lean towards A (Yes) because the excessive force after the initial threat could be considered unjustified.\n"
