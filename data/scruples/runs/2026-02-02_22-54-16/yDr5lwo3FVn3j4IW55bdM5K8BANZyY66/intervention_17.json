I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong after punching a cop multiple times. The situation is a bit complex. The author has a hearing impairment and an auditory processing disorder, which makes understanding speech hard, especially in noisy environments. \n\nFirst, the context: The person was walking in a parking lot, didn't notice a cop, turned around for a reason unrelated to avoiding the cop, and then jogged back. The cop saw this and called out, but the author didn't hear because of the noise and their condition. The cop then grabbed her, pinned her, and she fought back, hitting him several times. The result was significant injuries to the cop.\n\nThe author feels morally conflicted because they hit the cop even after realizing he was a cop and had already been injured. They also mention they called an ambulance and supported his neck, which shows some level of concern. The case was settled out of court, with footage showing the cop handled her roughly. Her disability was a factor, and the cop later apologized. \n\nNow, legal and moral aspects. Legally, the situation might depend on jurisdiction, but since it's settled, the legal system didn't find her guilty. Morally, the question is whether she acted in self-defense. She was in fear of being shot due to the cop's actions. The excessive force is a point of contention here. Did she need to hit him five times after he was already incapacitated? But considering her fear and the circumstances\u2014being in a dark parking lot, someone approaching with a gun\u2014maybe she felt cornered. Also, her disability played a role in her not hearing the cop initially, which complicates her intent.\n\nThe cop was handling her roughly, which could be seen as excessive force. Her reaction might be a legitimate self-defense, even if she overreacted. However, continuing to hit him after he was slumped might be seen as unnecessary. But in the heat of the moment, especially under stress and with a disability affecting perception, her judgment might have been impaired. The fact that the cop later apologized could imply that his actions were inappropriate, supporting her need to defend herself.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions might be justified as self-defense, despite the excess, given the circumstances and her disability. The key here is whether her response was proportionate to the threat she perceived. If she genuinely feared for her life and couldn't de-escalate, then it's not her fault. But the repeated hits after he was down could be seen as overkill. However, given the fear of being shot, maybe she felt she had to ensure her safety. The settlement and the cop's apology suggest that his actions were at fault, which might mitigate her responsibility. So, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
