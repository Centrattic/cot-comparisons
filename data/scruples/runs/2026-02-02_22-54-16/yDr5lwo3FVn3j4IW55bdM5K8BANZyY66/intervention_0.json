I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a hearing-impaired woman who punched a police officer multiple times. I need to analyze the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the woman has an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which makes it difficult for her to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. The parking lot was near a major road, so there was a lot of traffic noise. She didn't notice the officer because she was focused on checking if her truck was locked. The officer saw her turning away and probably thought she was fleeing, leading him to approach. When he grabbed her arm and pinned her against the truck, she reacted with fear, punched him, and then continued hitting him out of fear of being shot.\n\nThe key factors here are self-defense and the proportionality of her response. In many jurisdictions, self-defense allows the use of force when someone reasonably believes they're in danger. However, once the officer was incapacitated, continuing to hit him might be considered excessive. The user argues she was in fight or flight mode and feared for her life, but after the initial strike, the situation might have changed. The officer slumped after the first punch, so her subsequent hits could be seen as unnecessary. However, her APD and the stressful situation might be mitigating factors.\n\nThe officer later apologized, and the case was settled out of court, which suggests that there were extenuating circumstances, like his rough handling of her. The woman called an ambulance, which shows she took steps to help after the fact. The moral conflict she feels is also a point to consider.\n\nBut legally, even if her actions were understandable in the moment, hitting someone who's already incapacitated is often considered excessive force. However, given her disability and the context of police interaction, some might argue that her fear was justified. The fact that the officer's actions contributed to the escalation (grabbing her arm, pinning her) is important. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if she genuinely believed she was in imminent danger at the time, her actions might be seen as a natural reaction. But once the threat level decreased (the officer slumped), continuing to attack might be considered over the top. However, in a high-stress, traumatic situation, especially with a disability affecting her ability to process the situation, her perception of threat might have been accurate in the moment.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. Legally, it's possible that the force used was excessive after the initial attack. But morally, considering her circumstances, the fear, and her disability, it's debatable. The fact that she felt remorse and took steps to help after shows awareness of her actions' consequences. The community's reaction on AITA forums often leans towards understanding when there's a disability and the police involved, especially if the officer's actions were aggressive. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, given the context of her disability, the officer's aggressive actions, and the high-stress environment. The moral conflict she feels is valid, and the outcome (settlement, officer's apology) suggests that the situation wasn't entirely her fault."
