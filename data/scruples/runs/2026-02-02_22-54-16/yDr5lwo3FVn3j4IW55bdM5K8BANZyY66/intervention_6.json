I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after punching a police officer multiple times. The situation involves a hearing-impaired person named Alex who had a misunderstanding with an officer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Alex has an auditory processing disorder, which makes it hard to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a parking lot, didn't hear the officer approaching, turned around to check her car, and the officer must have thought she was fleeing. When he approached and grabbed her, she panicked and hit him. She continued hitting him even after realizing he was a cop, out of fear of being shot.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, self-defense is a key point. In many jurisdictions, the use of force must be proportional and necessary to prevent imminent harm. If Alex believed she was in immediate danger, her actions might be justified. However, continuing to hit the officer after he was incapacitated could be seen as excessive. The officer had a duty to protect and serve, so using deadly force against him might have different implications.\n\nMoral considerations are also important. The author feels remorse because the officer was injured and now has memory issues. She acknowledges her actions went beyond what might be strictly necessary. While her intent was self-defense, the outcome was severe. There's a balance between self-preservation and causing unnecessary harm.\n\nThe fact that the case was settled out of court and the officer apologized might indicate that the legal system saw some mitigating factors. However, the question of whether she's \"in the wrong\" isn't just legal but also moral. Some might argue that even in fear, once the officer was down, continuing to hit him was wrong. Others might say her disability and the circumstances (like not hearing the officer) justified her actions.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The key points are her disability, the officer's use of force, her fear of being shot, and the proportionality of her response. It's a complex situation where both parties have some fault. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since she acted out of fear and her disability contributed to the misunderstanding, some may see her as not in the wrong. However, the excessive force after the officer was subdued could be a point against her.\n"
