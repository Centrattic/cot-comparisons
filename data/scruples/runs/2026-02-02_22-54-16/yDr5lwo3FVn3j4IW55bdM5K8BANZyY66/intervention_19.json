I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman with hearing impairment and APD who ended up punching a cop multiple times. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman didn't hear the officer, which led to a misunderstanding. She was trying to go back to her truck because she was worried she didn't lock it. The officer probably thought she was fleeing. When he approached and grabbed her, she panicked and hit him. Then, even after seeing he was a cop, she hit him five more times out of fear of being shot.\n\nThe key points here are self-defense and the reasonableness of her actions. Self-defense laws vary by jurisdiction, but generally, you can defend yourself if you believe you're in imminent danger. However, the question is whether her response was proportional. \n\nThe officer was just doing his job, trying to detain her. She hit him multiple times after he had already been subdued. Even if she was scared, continuing to hit him once he was on the ground might be seen as excessive. The fact that she was hearing impaired and had APD could be a mitigating factor, but the law usually looks at the facts as they were, not just the person's perception.\n\nAlso, she was a tiny white lady, which might have influenced how the situation was perceived. The officer might have used more force if he thought she was resisting. However, she did call an ambulance and stayed to help, which shows she wasn't trying to flee after the incident.\n\nThe author feels bad about the damage caused, which is a sign of moral conflict. But legally, even if it's a grey area, the act of hitting a police officer multiple times beyond what's necessary could be considered assault. The fact that the officer retired early and has memory issues complicates things, as it shows significant harm.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, using force against law enforcement can have stricter penalties. Even if the officer was rough, the woman's response might have been excessive. The video footage showing the officer handling her roughly might explain why the case settled out of court, but it doesn't necessarily clear her of wrongdoing.\n\nSo, while her hearing impairment is a factor, the act of continuing to hit the officer after he was down might be considered in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because the force used was excessive beyond the initial self-defense.\n"
