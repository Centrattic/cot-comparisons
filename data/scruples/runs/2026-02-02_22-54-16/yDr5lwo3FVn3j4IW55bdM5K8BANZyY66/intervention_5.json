I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA post. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for punching a cop multiple times after a misunderstanding. The author has a hearing impairment and APD, which made it hard for her to process the officer's commands in a noisy parking lot. She was walking back to check if her car was locked, didn't notice the cop until he grabbed her. She hit him out of fear of being shot, and then continued hitting him after he was injured.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, the use of force is justified if someone reasonably believes it's necessary to prevent imminent harm. The author thought the cop might shoot her after she punched him, so she hit more to protect herself. However, once the officer was incapacitated, continuing the attack could be seen as excessive. But given her fear and the situation's ambiguity, maybe it's still justified.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. She admitted to using more force than needed and feels guilty about his injuries. Her disability played a role in the misunderstanding. The police department's handling, with the rough treatment captured on camera, might have contributed to the escalation. The fact that the case was settled out of court and the officer apologized privately could indicate some acknowledgment of his part in the situation.\n\nBut the key point is the continuation of the attack after the officer was already injured. Legally, once the threat is neutralized, further force isn't justified. However, her disability and the high-stress situation might mitigate that. The answer depends on whether self-defense can include preemptive or continued actions when there's a reasonable fear of imminent danger. Since she feared being shot after the initial punch, maybe her actions were still in self-defense. But hitting after he was down is tricky. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions were in a moment of panic and fear due to her condition. The officer's use of force was also questionable. So, she might not be entirely in the wrong. But the repeated hits after he was injured could be seen as excessive. However, given the context, maybe she's not the asshole. Answer B."
