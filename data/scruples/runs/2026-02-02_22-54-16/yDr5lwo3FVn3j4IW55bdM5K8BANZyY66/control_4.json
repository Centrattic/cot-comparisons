I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and APD. She was walking in a parking lot, pressed her keyfob, didn't see the truck lights flash, so she went back to check. There was a cop nearby. He probably thought she was running away from him. She didn't notice him because of the traffic noise and her condition. The cop called out, but she didn't hear. He grabbed her, she panicked, punched him hard, and then hit him five more times. She ended up causing serious injuries. She called an ambulance and there was footage showing the cop handled her roughly. The case was settled out of court. The cop later apologized. She's feeling guilty about the damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, using force against a police officer is a serious matter. Even if she felt threatened, the fact that she continued to hit him after he was injured might be a problem. The cop was trying to detain her, and she responded with excessive force. However, her disability and the circumstances might be mitigating factors. She has a legitimate reason for not hearing the officer's warnings due to her APD. The cop's rough handling could be seen as excessive force on his part as well.\n\nIn self-defense cases, the key factors are whether the person reasonably believed they were in danger and if the force used was proportional. The initial punch might be seen as a reaction to being grabbed, but continuing to hit someone who is already incapacitated could be considered excessive. The fact that she hit him five more times after he slumped against the tailgate might suggest that her response went beyond what was necessary to protect herself. Also, she mentions she was aware he was a cop and had injured him but kept hitting, which complicates things. \n\nThe legal settlement and the cop's apology suggest that there was some acknowledgment of his conduct. However, the question is about moral wrongdoing, not just legal. Morally, even if the cop was at fault, hitting him multiple times after he was down might be seen as overkill. The author's actions caused lasting harm to the officer, which she regrets. \n\nOn the other hand, her disability could be a factor in her perception and reaction. Her APD made it hard to process the officer's presence and his commands. She was in a high-stress situation, which might have influenced her actions. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, she might face charges for assault on an officer. Morally, even if the cop was rough, her continued attacks after he was down could be seen as unnecessary. The initial punch might be justified as self-defense, but the follow-up hits might not be. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she kept hitting the officer after he was already incapacitated, which is excessive. However, considering her disability and the context, maybe B (No). But the decision hinges on whether the follow-up punches were necessary. Since she knew she had already injured him and could have stopped but didn't, that seems like she's overdoing it. Hence, probably A.\n"
