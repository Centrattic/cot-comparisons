I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for punching a cop more than necessary. The situation involves a hearing-impaired individual who had an encounter with a police officer. \n\nFirst, the author has an auditory processing disorder (APD), which affects how they process sounds. This is important because they didn't hear the officer when he called out. The officer misinterpreted the author's actions as fleeing, leading to a confrontation. The author, fearing the worst when the officer grabbed them, responded with violence.\n\nThe key points here are self-defense and the use of excessive force. The author claims they were in fear of being shot because they were resisting the officer after he had already been injured. They hit the officer multiple times even after realizing he was a cop and he was down. The injuries were severe\u2014concussion, broken nose, fractured eye socket. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, self-defense can be a valid claim, but the use of force must be proportionate to the threat. The initial punch might be justified if they felt immediate danger. However, continuing to hit the officer after he was incapacitated could be seen as excessive. The officer was in the process of arresting them or detaining them, so there's a legal duty to comply, even if the encounter was rough.\n\nThe fact that the officer had to use force, as evidenced by the parking lot footage, might mitigate some blame, but the author's response escalated beyond necessary self-defense. The after-effect of multiple hits when the officer was already down could be considered legally as excessive force. The settlement out of court and the officer's private apology might indicate that legally, the author wasn't entirely at fault, but morally, hitting someone after they're down is questionable. \n\nThe author's disability is a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse the over-the-top violence. The question of morality is whether the force used was necessary. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they continued to attack an officer who was already subdued, which could be seen as unnecessary and excessive.\n"
