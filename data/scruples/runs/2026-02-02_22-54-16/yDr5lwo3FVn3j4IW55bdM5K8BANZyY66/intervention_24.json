I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is hearing impaired with APD. That affects how they process sounds, especially in noisy environments. The story mentions traffic noise, which could have made it hard for her to hear the officer announcing he was a cop. So maybe she didn't realize he was a police officer when he approached.\n\nShe was walking in a parking lot, pressing her keyfob to lock her truck but didn't see the lights. She turned back to check, which the officer might have misinterpreted as running away. The officer called after her, but she didn't hear him. Then he grabbed her arm and pinned her against the truck. \n\nAt that point, she felt threatened and hit him. She felt like she was in danger, maybe thinking he would shoot her if she didn't defend herself. She hit him five more times even after realizing he was a cop. She caused serious injuries, leading to memory issues and an early retirement for the officer.\n\nNow, considering self-defense laws. In most places, you can use force if you believe you're in immediate danger. But if the officer was just grabbing her arm, was that a threat sufficient for deadly force? The officer had the right to detain her if she was suspected of a crime, but his actions might have been excessive. The parking lot video showed him handling her roughly, which might indicate he used unnecessary force.\n\nHer hearing impairment plays a role here. If she couldn't hear the officer identifying himself, she might not have known he was a law enforcement officer. That could affect the legal aspect\u2014whether she could reasonably know he was a cop. If she didn't know, maybe her actions weren't against the law, but if she should have known, that's a different story.\n\nThe aftermath: she called an ambulance and stayed until help arrived. The case was settled out of court, which might suggest that the police department had some liability. The officer later apologized, which might indicate he overstepped.\n\nBut the key issue is whether the author's response was reasonable. She hit him multiple times even after realizing he was a cop. That's the part she's conflicted about. The initial punch might be justified if she felt immediate danger, but continuing to hit him after he was injured could be excessive. However, her fear of being shot might have influenced her actions, thinking he might pull his gun if she stopped.\n\nIn terms of morality, there's a conflict between self-defense and causing unnecessary harm. The fact that she ended up harming a person, even a police officer, who retired early is something she feels guilty about. But her intent was to defend herself.\n\nLegally, maybe there's a defense based on her disability and the circumstances. Morally, it's a tough call. She acted out of fear and a need to protect herself, but also caused significant harm. However, the officer's initial rough handling contributed to the situation. The fact that the video showed his rough handling supports her side.\n\nSo, considering all factors: her disability, the officer's potentially excessive force, her justified fear, and the legal settlement, it's possible the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B\u2014No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
