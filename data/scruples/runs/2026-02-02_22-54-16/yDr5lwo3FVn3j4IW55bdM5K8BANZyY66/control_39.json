I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a 24-year-old woman with an auditory processing disorder punched a cop. The key points are her hearing impairment, the miscommunication, and the resulting injuries.\n\nFirst, she has APD, which makes it hard to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. That's a valid disability. She was walking in a poorly lit parking lot near a major road, so there's a lot of traffic noise. When she pressed her keyfob, the truck's lights didn't flash because she was too far away. She decided to go back to check, which the cop might have misinterpreted as her running away. The cop called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear due to her condition and the environment.\n\nWhen the cop grabbed her, she felt pinned against her truck. Her reaction was to pull away and hit him, thinking he might shoot her. She continued hitting him multiple times even after he slumped, out of fear. The result was serious injuries: concussion, broken nose, fractured eye socket. She did call an ambulance and stayed until help arrived. The case was settled out of court, and the cop later apologized.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong for continuing to hit him after the initial punch. Legally, self-defense usually allows using reasonable force to prevent harm. But she kept hitting even after he was down, which might be excessive. Morally, she was scared, but causing serious injury beyond what's necessary to defend herself could be seen as crossing a line. However, her disability and the cop's use of rough force might mitigate her responsibility. The cop's apology suggests he acknowledged some fault, like using excessive force. But the woman admitted to using more force than needed. So, the answer is a bit tricky. It depends on the balance between her fear and the excessive retaliation. Since she kept hitting even when he was down and not an immediate threat, that might make her the asshole. But her disability and the cop's initial rough handling could be factors. However, the question is about the amount of damage she caused. So maybe A is the answer because she used more force than necessary once the threat was neutralized.\n"
