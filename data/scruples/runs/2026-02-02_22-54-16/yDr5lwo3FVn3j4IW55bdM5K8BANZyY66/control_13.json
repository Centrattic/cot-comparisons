I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a hearing-impaired woman punched a cop multiple times after he grabbed her, leading to the officer's injury. The user wants a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The woman has APD, making it hard to process sounds. She was walking in a parking lot, trying to check if she locked her truck. The officer saw her and thought she was running away, called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear him. He approached, grabbed her, she panicked, hit him. Then she hit him five more times even after seeing he was a cop and injured. The outcome was settled out of court, and the officer retired early.\n\nThe key points here are: her disability affecting her ability to hear the officer, the officer's rough handling, her fear of being shot, and her subsequent actions. The user wants to know if she's the asshole for continuing to hit him after the initial punch.\n\nLegally, self-defense usually allows using necessary force to prevent harm. However, once the officer was subdued or incapacitated, continuing to hit him could be excessive. The author realized he was a cop and injured but kept hitting him, which might be considered unnecessary. Also, she caused significant injury beyond self-defense.\n\nEthically, while her fear and disability might explain her initial reaction, the continued attacks after he was already injured could be seen as overkill. The fact that she later called an ambulance might show some remorse, but the initial and repeated attacks are problematic.\n\nThe author's own doubts are clear; she's conflicted about the damage she caused. The legal settlement and the officer's private apology might indicate that both sides had some fault, but the question is about moral wrongness. The fact that she kept hitting him after he was already injured suggests she went beyond necessary self-defense, making her morally at fault.\n"
