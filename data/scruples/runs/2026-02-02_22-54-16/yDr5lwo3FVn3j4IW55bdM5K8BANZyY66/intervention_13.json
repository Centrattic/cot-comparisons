I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a hearing-impaired woman who ended up punching a cop. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, she has APD, which affects how she processes sounds. This makes it hard for her to understand speech, especially in noisy environments. She was in a Walmart parking lot near a busy road, so there's a lot of traffic noise. She was walking back to her truck because she was worried she didn't lock it. The cop saw her, probably thought she was running away, called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear him due to the noise and her condition. He grabbed her, she felt threatened, yanked free, and hit him. Then she hit him five more times because she was afraid he might shoot her.\n\nNow, the key points here are her disability and the circumstances leading to the altercation. She didn't hear the officer's warning, which is a crucial factor. Her reaction was based on fear of being shot, which might be a justifiable self-defense reason. However, continuing to hit him after he was already injured is where the moral conflict comes in. She caused significant harm, but the police department had footage showing the officer handled her roughly, which might have led to the settlement out of court. Also, the officer later apologized, which could imply some fault on his part for using excessive force.\n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, self-defense laws vary, but generally, you can use reasonable force to protect yourself. If she believed her life was in danger, hitting him might be justified. However, hitting him multiple times after he was incapacitated might be seen as excessive. But considering her disability and the environment, her inability to process the officer's commands could mitigate her responsibility.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. She acted out of fear, but the outcome was severe for the officer. She feels remorse and took responsibility by calling an ambulance. The fact that the case was settled privately and the officer's apology suggest that the situation wasn't entirely her fault. However, hitting someone multiple times, even in self-defense, can be seen as overkill. But given her circumstances, maybe it's understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the answer is B (she's not in the wrong) because her actions were influenced by her disability and the officer's rough handling. The context of her hearing impairment and the fear of being shot plays a big role here. The officer's actions might have contributed to the escalation. Therefore, she's not entirely at fault.\n"
