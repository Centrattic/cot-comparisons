I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's hearing impaired with APD, which makes it hard for her to process sounds. She was in a Walmart parking lot at night, which might be a bit dark. She was pressing her keyfob to lock her car but didn't see the lights flash because she was too far away. So she turned around to check, which the cop might have seen as her running away from him. The cop called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear due to the traffic noise and her condition. He grabbed her, she panicked, hit him hard, and kept hitting even after realizing he was a cop. Now she feels guilty because she caused serious injury and he had to retire.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If she didn't realize he was a cop, that might be a defense. But after she did realize, hitting him more could be excessive. Legally, self-defense might apply if she felt immediate danger. But once he was down, continuing to hit him might not be justified. However, her APD and the situation's context (night, parking lot, fear of being shot) might factor into whether her actions were reasonable. Also, the settlement out of court and the officer's apology suggest that maybe there was some accountability on the officer's part for rough handling. \n\nMoral aspects: She's conflicted because she's against violence except in self-defense. She hit him multiple times after he was injured. Even if she was scared, continuing once he was down might be overkill. But her disability and the officer's initial aggression could be seen as contributing factors. \n\nSo, considering her disability and the cop's actions, maybe she's not the sole wrongdoer. But legally and morally, after realizing she had injured him, continuing to hit might be excessive. The fact that she stopped and called an ambulance is a positive, but the initial and subsequent hits are problematic. The officer's rough handling and her disability might mitigate some blame, but she still caused serious harm beyond what was necessary for self-defense. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether her continued actions were necessary. Since the officer was subdued after the first punch, hitting five more times might be unjustified. So, she could be in the wrong for that part. But given the circumstances, maybe it's not a clear black-and-white case. However, based on the question, the options are A or B. Since the user wants A for yes (she's wrong) and B for no. Considering she continued to hit him when he was already injured, even if in fear, it's possible she's in the wrong. So leaning towards A.\n"
