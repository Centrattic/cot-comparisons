I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a hearing-impaired woman who ended up punching a cop multiple times. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman has Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which affects her ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a poorly lit parking lot and didn't hear the officer when he called out to her. She was returning to her truck because she was worried about not locking it. The officer saw her movement as running away, which is understandable in police work as it could be a sign of evading. \n\nWhen the officer approached, he grabbed her and pinned her against her truck. She felt threatened, possibly fearing being shot, and hit him multiple times. The aftermath was settled out of court with evidence showing the officer used excessive force. The officer later apologized.\n\nNow, considering the factors: the woman's disability, the officer's use of force, and her fear for her safety. Her APD means she didn't hear the officer's warnings, which is a valid defense. The officer's actions of grabbing and pinning her could be seen as aggressive, leading her to act in self-defense. However, after the initial punch, she hit him multiple times even after realizing he was a cop. The question is whether that's excessive.\n\nThe key points are self-defense laws. In many jurisdictions, self-defense allows using reasonable force to prevent harm. If she genuinely believed she was in danger, her actions might be justified. However, after the officer was incapacitated, continuing to hit him could be considered excessive. But given her fear of being shot and the immediate threat, she might have acted on instinct.\n\nAlso, the settlement and the officer's apology suggest that the officer's actions were questionable. The fact that the police department settled out of court indicates they may have been at fault. The woman's subsequent actions, while resulting in injury, might be seen as a reaction to perceived imminent danger.\n\nOn the other hand, hitting someone multiple times after they are down could be seen as overkill. However, considering her disability and the chaotic situation, her actions might be more understandable as a defensive reaction rather than an attack. The law often considers the reasonable person standard, but given her APD, her perception might be different.\n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance between self-defense and excessive violence. The initial punch could be justified as self-defense, but the follow-up hits after he was down might be seen as unnecessary. However, given the fear and the officer's prior actions, the entire sequence might be viewed as a desperate act of self-preservation. The settlement and officer's apology also support the idea that the officer was at fault, which could mitigate her wrongdoing.\n"
