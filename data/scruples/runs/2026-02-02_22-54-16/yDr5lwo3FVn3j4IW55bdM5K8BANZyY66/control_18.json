I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the woman (the author) is in the wrong for punching the cop more than necessary. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the woman has a hearing impairment and APD, which makes understanding speech difficult, especially in noisy environments. She was walking in a poorly lit parking lot, trying to check if she locked her truck. She didn't notice the cop because of the traffic noise and her condition. The cop saw her turn around and jog back, which probably looked like she was fleeing. He called out that he was a cop, but she couldn't hear him.\n\nWhen the cop approached and grabbed her, she panicked. She yanked her arm free and hit him. Then, even after seeing he was a cop and he was injured, she hit him five more times. She was afraid of being shot, which is a valid fear in such situations. The outcome was that the cop retired early with memory issues, and she feels guilty.\n\nNow, the key points here: self-defense vs. excessive force. In many jurisdictions, self-defense is justified when there's an immediate threat. But once she realized he was injured and maybe the threat wasn't immediate, continuing to hit him might cross into excessive force. Also, she was aware that he was a police officer, which might change the legal perspective because of the duty to comply with police.\n\nHowever, her disability plays a role here. Since she couldn't hear the cop's announcement, her lack of awareness might mitigate some of the fault. The cop's rough handling of her could be a contributing factor. The fact that there's footage showing his rough behavior might have influenced the settlement out of court.\n\nLegally, the line between self-defense and assault can be blurry. If she genuinely believed she was in imminent danger of being shot, hitting back could be seen as necessary. But continuing to hit after he was down and injured might be considered beyond what's needed. Morally, she feels conflicted because she knows she went overboard, even if she had a reason to act in fear.\n\nThe cop later apologized, which might indicate that his actions were at least partially at fault. But the question is whether the woman is in the wrong. Given that she had a disability affecting her hearing, the cop's roughness, and her fear of being shot, there are mitigating factors. However, the excessive force in continuing to hit him after he was down might make her at least partially at fault.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might depend on legal standards, but morally and legally, she might be seen as not entirely in the wrong because of her circumstances. But there's a part where she could have stopped once the threat subsided, so there's a case for her being partially wrong. But given the context, the answer might be B (No), because the situation is complex with mitigating factors.\n"
