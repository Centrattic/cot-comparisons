I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person is hearing impaired and had an APD, which affects their ability to process sounds. They were in a parking lot, and a cop thought they were running away. The cop grabbed them, they punched the cop, and kept hitting them even after the initial punch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. In many places, using force against law enforcement can have legal consequences. Even if the person felt threatened, the fact that the officer was trying to restrain them might mean that the person's subsequent actions are considered excessive. The author hit the cop multiple times after the initial punch, causing serious injuries. Legally, self-defense usually stops when the threat is neutralized. So if the cop was subdued after the first punch, hitting more might not be justified.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author mentions they dislike violence except in self-defense. They were afraid of being shot, which is understandable, but hitting someone multiple times after they were already injured might cross a line. The officer apologized later, which could indicate some level of understanding, but the author is still troubled by the harm caused. The officer's early retirement and memory issues are significant, so the author's guilt is understandable.\n\nHowever, the author has a disability that affected their ability to perceive the cop's presence. There's footage showing the cop handled them roughly, which might mitigate some blame. But the key issue is whether the force used was necessary after the initial threat. The author could have stopped once the officer was down or sought help instead of continuing to hit. The fact that they called an ambulance shows they cared, but the initial and continued violence is questionable.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can't use deadly force against a non-lethal threat. Even if the cop was being aggressive, the author's use of force leading to serious injury might be seen as excessive. Also, the officer was doing their job, so there's a balance between self-defense and overreaction. The author's fear of being shot adds to the complexity, but once the officer was down, the threat might have been neutralized.\n\nSo, putting it all together, legally and morally, the author might be considered in the wrong for using more force than necessary after the initial punch. However, their disability and the cop's rough handling could be mitigating factors. But since the question is whether they are the asshole, the answer might lean towards yes because they caused unnecessary harm beyond self-defense.\n"
