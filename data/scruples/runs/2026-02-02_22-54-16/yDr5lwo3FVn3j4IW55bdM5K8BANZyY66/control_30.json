I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for punching a cop. The situation involves her being hearing impaired with APD, which makes understanding sounds difficult. She was in a parking lot, turned back to check if she locked her truck, didn't realize there was a cop. The cop chased her, grabbed her, and she hit him multiple times. She ended up giving him serious injuries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Her disability is a key factor here. Since she has trouble processing auditory information, she might not have heard the cop calling out. That could explain why she didn't realize he was a police officer. When he grabbed her, she was in fear, maybe thinking he was a threat. Her reaction might be a self-defense mechanism due to the fear of being shot. \n\nBut then, after the initial punch, she kept hitting him even after seeing he was a cop. The question is whether that's justified. She claims she did it because she was afraid he might pull his gun. But once she realized he was a cop and had already hit him, continuing to attack might be excessive. \n\nLegally, self-defense usually requires that the force used is reasonable and proportionate to the threat. If she was afraid of being shot, maybe her initial reaction was justified, but hitting him multiple times after the threat might have been neutralized could be excessive. Also, the fact that the cop had footage showing he handled her roughly might mitigate some of the blame, but she still caused serious injury.\n\nMorally, she feels conflicted because she caused harm, even if unintended. The police officer now has memory issues and had to retire, which adds to her guilt. The public court was avoided, so maybe the legal repercussions were less, but ethically, she's questioning her actions. \n\nOn the other hand, her disability is a significant factor. The system might be biased against her because she's a \"tiny white lady,\" but in reality, her hearing impairment played a role in the misunderstanding. The officer's own rough handling could be part of the problem. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the continued attacks were necessary. If she was in fear and believed he was about to shoot her, maybe she wasn't in the wrong. But once she realized he was a cop and he wasn't shooting, continuing to hit him could be considered wrong. However, the fear and adrenaline in the moment might have clouded her judgment. \n\nConsidering all factors, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong because of her disability and the fear-induced reaction, but the excessive force after the initial threat might make her partially responsible. However, the key point is whether she was in immediate danger when she continued to hit him. If the cop hadn't drawn his weapon, her continued attacks might be excessive. But if she genuinely believed he was going to shoot, even then, it's a tough call. \n\nIn the end, the author is conflicted, and the situation is complex. But since she kept hitting after the initial punch, it's possible that she went beyond what was necessary, making her partially at fault. But given her disability and the circumstances, maybe not entirely. The answer might be a mix, but the user wants a clear A or B. Given that she used more force than necessary after the threat was possibly neutralized, the answer might lean towards A (wrong). However, her justification based on fear and disability complicates it. Maybe B (not wrong) because of the disability and the fear of being shot. Hmm. This is tricky.\n"
