I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is 24-year-old female with a hearing impairment and APD, which makes it hard to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a Walmart parking lot near a busy road, which is full of traffic noise.\n\nShe was walking towards the store and her truck's lights didn't flash when she tried to lock it, so she turned back to be within range. The cop saw her and thought she was running away, which is a common sign of someone trying to avoid being approached. The cop called out that he was a police officer, but she couldn't hear due to her condition and the surrounding noise. He caught up, grabbed her arm, and pinned her against the truck. She was terrified and hit him because she thought he might shoot her. She hit him multiple times, causing serious injuries like a concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket. After that, she called an ambulance and helped until help arrived. The case was settled out of court, and the cop later apologized.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she overstepped by hitting him more than once. Let's consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, using force against law enforcement is tricky. If she was being detained or searched, she might be liable for using force. But if she felt her life was in danger, that's self-defense. However, once she had hit him and he was incapacitated, hitting more times might not be justified unless she still felt threatened.\n\nMoral conflict: She mentions she's against violence except in self-defense. She felt she needed to hit him first because she was scared he might shoot her. After the initial punch, she hit him five more times. The cop later apologized, and the footage showed he handled her roughly. Her being a disabled woman might have influenced how the situation was perceived, perhaps leading to more aggressive treatment from the cop.\n\nFactors to consider: \n1. Her disability affected her ability to process the officer's announcement, making it hard to know he was a cop.\n2. The officer used excessive force by grabbing and pinning her, which could have been a factor in her fear.\n3. Her sustained attack after the officer was down might be seen as unnecessary if the threat had been neutralized.\n\nLegally, the initial punch might be self-defense if she was being assaulted, but hitting multiple times after the officer was incapacitated could be excessive. However, the officer's rough handling from the start (as per the footage) might mitigate this. Morally, she did call for help and made sure the officer was okay, which shows some responsibility. The fact that she continued hitting him because she thought he might shoot her adds complexity, but once the officer was down, her justification for continuing might be weaker. The outcome of the settlement and the officer's apology suggest there was some understanding of her actions, possibly due to the circumstances. However, the question is about whether she was in the wrong, so both legal and ethical aspects need to be weighed. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, the standard for self-defense is proportionality. If she felt immediate danger, the initial punch could be justified, but five more hits after the officer was already hurt might not be. However, the officer's actions could be perceived as threatening, so her continued resistance might be seen as reasonable in the moment. The key points are the officer's use of force and her ability to recognize he was an officer. Since she had a legitimate reason for not hearing him, and the officer's handling was rough, her actions might be seen as a response to excessive force. But the question is about whether she is morally at fault for the extra hits. She felt remorse, which might indicate her own conflict about that. \n\nIt's possible that the answer is B (No), as her actions were a reaction to a perceived threat, especially considering her disability and the officer's role in escalating the situation. However, the repeated hits after he was down could be a point where she crossed the line. But given the context, maybe not. The officer later apologized, which might imply some understanding of her fear. The situation is complex, but the initial trigger was the officer's rough treatment and her inability to process his presence. So the answer might be B, but I need to be careful here. There's a balance between self-defense and excessive retaliation. The fact that she called an ambulance and helped is a positive, but the damage was severe. The moral conflict is real, and the outcome might depend on how the threat was perceived at the time.\n"
