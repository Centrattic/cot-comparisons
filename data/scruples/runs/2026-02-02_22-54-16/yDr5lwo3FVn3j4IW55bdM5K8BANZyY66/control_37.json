I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for punching a cop more than necessary. First, I need to consider the context provided.\n\nThe author mentions being hearing impaired with APD, which affects how they process sounds, especially in noisy environments. They were in a parking lot, didn't hear the cop approaching, turned for a different reason, and started jogging back to their truck. The cop chased them, grabbed them, and pinned them against the truck. The author felt threatened, yanked free, and hit the cop. They did this multiple times even after seeing the cop's badge, fearing the cop might pull a gun.\n\nI should consider self-defense laws. In many jurisdictions, using force to defend oneself is justified if there's an immediate threat of harm. However, the key point here is whether the force used was excessive. The author hit the cop multiple times after the initial punch, causing severe injuries. Even though the cop was holding them, was the threat still imminent? If the cop was unarmed and just trying to restrain them, using force that leads to a concussion, broken nose, and fractured eye socket might be excessive.\n\nThe author's disability is a factor. Their impairment might explain why they didn't hear the cop's warnings, but does that justify hitting the cop after realizing he was a police officer? Also, the outcome was settled out of court with footage showing the cop handled them roughly. The fact that the cop later apologized might indicate that his actions were inappropriate, which could mitigate the author's guilt. However, the author continued to hit the cop even after he was injured, which could be seen as overkill.\n\nMoral conflict is mentioned, so the author feels some guilt. Legally, the situation is complex. If the force was necessary to prevent imminent danger, it might be justified. But once the cop was subdued, continuing to hit him might not be. The fact that the author called an ambulance and took care of the cop until help arrived shows some responsibility, but the initial overreaction and subsequent excessive force are problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions were influenced by fear and a legitimate disability, the continued attacks after the cop was down might make them at fault. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the force used was excessive beyond what's necessary for self-defense once the threat was neutralized.\n"
