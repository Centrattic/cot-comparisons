I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a hearing-impaired woman got into an altercation with a police officer. She has APD, which affects her ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was walking in a parking lot, trying to check if her truck was locked. The officer saw her, thought she was running away, called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear him. He grabbed her arm, she pulled away, and punched him multiple times, causing serious injuries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In self-defense, the key factors are whether the person reasonably believed they were in danger and acted proportionally. The author was hearing impaired and in a noisy environment. The officer approached her after she didn't hear him, grabbed her arm, and pinned her against the truck. That might be considered an unlawful use of force. She was terrified, thinking he might shoot her, which is a valid fear given the situation. When she punched him, she was reacting to an immediate threat. However, after the initial punch that knocked him down, she hit him five more times. That part is tricky. Even if she was scared, continuing to hit someone who's already incapacitated could be excessive, especially if the threat was over. The officer later apologized, which might indicate he used unnecessary force.\n\nMoral aspects: She felt it was self-defense but regrets the excessive damage. She has a disability that contributed to the misunderstanding. The police department had footage showing the officer's rough handling, which might have influenced the outcome. She called an ambulance and stayed to help, which shows she didn't want to leave him in a bad state. Her APD is a significant factor in her not realizing he was a cop until after the initial attack. The fact that she's a small woman might have played a role in the officer's response and the public perception.\n\nLegal vs. Moral: Legally, she might have a strong case due to the officer's use of force and her disability. Morally, she might be conflicted because she caused serious injury, even if it was self-defense. However, her actions were in response to a perceived threat. The question is whether hitting him multiple times after the initial threat was neutralized (he was slumped against the tailgate) was necessary. If she was still in fear that he might pull his gun, maybe she felt it was needed, but once he was down, continuing could be excessive. But given her fear and the high-stress situation, it's understandable she didn't stop.\n\nConsidering all that, there's a mix of justifiable self-defense and possible overreaction. However, given her disability and the officer's initial aggressive actions, it's more about self-defense. The key point is whether her actions were proportionate. The first punch could be justified, but the five more might be where the line is crossed. Still, in the heat of the moment, especially under stress and with a hearing impairment, it's possible she acted in real-time fear. The resolution being out of court and the officer's apology suggest that the legal system saw her as not entirely at fault. So, maybe she's not in the wrong entirely.\n"
