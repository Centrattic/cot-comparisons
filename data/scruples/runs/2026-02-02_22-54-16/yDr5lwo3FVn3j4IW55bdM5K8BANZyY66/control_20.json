I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a hearing-impaired woman who ended up punching a police officer multiple times after being grabbed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She has a hearing disorder, which makes understanding speech difficult, especially in noisy environments. She didn't hear the officer approaching or his warnings. She turned back because she thought she hadn't locked her car, not to flee. The officer saw her movement as suspicious and grabbed her. She panicked, fearing for her life, and hit him. Then, even after realizing he was a cop, she continued hitting him out of fear of being shot.\n\nNow, the key points here are self-defense laws. In many places, a person can use reasonable force to protect themselves from imminent danger. But when does force become unreasonable? She hit him multiple times after he was already subdued (he slumped against the tailgate). Even though she was scared, continuing to attack after he was incapacitated might cross the line into excessive force.\n\nAlso, the fact that she had hearing impairments could be a mitigating factor. Her inability to process the officer's verbal warnings due to her disability might justify her confusion. However, once she saw he was a cop and he wasn't advancing or holding a weapon, continuing to hit him might not be justified.\n\nThe officer's actions were rough, as noted by the surveillance footage and his later apology. His handling of the situation was inappropriate, which could mitigate some blame on the officer's side. But the author's response involved causing significant injury. Even if she felt threatened initially, the continued attacks after the officer was down might not be necessary self-defense.\n\nIn legal terms, self-defense typically requires that the force used is proportional to the threat. If the officer wasn't actively threatening her with a weapon after being hit and slumped, the continued assault might not be legally justified. Morally, it's a gray area because she had a disability that affected her perception, but intentionally causing severe injury beyond what's needed for immediate defense could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors: her disability, the officer's initial rough handling, her fear, but also the excessive force after the threat subsided. The answer might hinge on whether her continued attacks were necessary. Since she hit him five more times after he was already injured, that seems excessive even in self-defense. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
