I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a woman with hearing impairment and auditory processing disorder who ended up punching a cop multiple times. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman has a disability that makes it hard for her to process sounds, especially in a noisy environment like a parking lot near a major road. She didn't realize the officer was a cop and turned around for a different reason. The officer, thinking she was fleeing, approached her, grabbed her arm, and pinned her against her truck. She then punched him, fearing for her life because she was worried he might shoot her. She hit him five more times even after seeing he was a cop and injured him.\n\nNow, the key points here are self-defense and the proportionality of her response. In self-defense cases, the individual's actions must be reasonable given the perceived threat. The officer's rough handling could be a factor. However, once she realized he was a cop and had already injured him, hitting five more times might be excessive. But given her fear and the fact that she was dealing with a police officer using force, there's a possible justification in the moment.\n\nThe author's disability is a critical factor here. The officer might have been aware that she had a hearing impairment, which could affect his duty to use appropriate force. If the officer grabbed her in a way that was overly aggressive, especially without clear cause, that could mitigate the woman's liability. Also, the outcome was settled out of court, which suggests that there were extenuating circumstances in her favor.\n\nThe author expressed remorse and called for an ambulance, which shows she wasn't acting with malice. However, the question is whether her actions went beyond what was necessary. Even if she feared for her life initially, continuing to hit him after he was slumped against the truck might be seen as excessive. But given her panic and the high-stress situation, it's debatable.\n\nIn terms of legal standards, self-defense often allows for actions that are reasonable under the circumstances. If the officer's use of force was unlawful or excessive, her response could be considered justified. However, if the officer's actions were within protocol, then her response might be seen as overkill. The fact that the officer later apologized and that the incident was settled out of court might indicate that the department acknowledges some fault.\n\nSo, considering all factors: her disability, the officer's handling, her fear, and the outcome, it's a close call. But since she continued hitting after the initial injury, which caused significant harm (concussion, broken nose, fractured eye socket), maybe there's some fault. However, the situation is complex enough that a definitive answer isn't straightforward. But given the options, I think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong because the officer's actions might have triggered her self-defense response, and the disability played a role in her perception and reaction.\n"
