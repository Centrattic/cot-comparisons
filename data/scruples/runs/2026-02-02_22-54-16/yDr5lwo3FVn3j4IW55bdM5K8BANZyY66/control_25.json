I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and auditory processing disorder. That's important because it affects her ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She explains that she didn't hear the officer when he called out to her. The context is a poorly lit parking lot near a major road, which adds to the noise and confusion.\n\nShe was walking toward the Walmart, pressed her keyfob to lock the truck, but didn't see the lights because she was too far away. She decided to double back, which the officer might have misinterpreted as her running away from him. The officer approached, identified himself as a cop, but she didn't hear him due to the traffic noise and her APD. When he grabbed her arm and pinned her against the truck, she felt threatened and reacted violently, even after realizing he was a cop.\n\nThe key points here are self-defense versus excessive force. The author hit the officer multiple times even after he was injured and slumped against the truck. She mentions hitting him five more times because she was afraid he might pull out a gun. However, once he was already subdued, continuing to hit him could be considered unnecessary. \n\nLegally, self-defense usually requires that the force used is proportional to the threat. If the officer had already been incapacitated and was not an immediate threat, then the additional hits might be seen as excessive. However, her perception of threat due to her disability and the situation might be taken into account.\n\nThe fact that the officer later apologized and the case was settled out of court suggests there was some acknowledgment of his rough handling. But the author's actions in continuing to attack after the officer was down could still be problematic. Even if her fear was justified initially, once the threat was neutralized (he was injured and not advancing), the continued violence might be seen as overkill.\n\nAlso, she caused significant injury to the officer: concussion, broken nose, fractured eye socket. Those are serious injuries. While she did call an ambulance and help until it arrived, the initial and subsequent punches might be seen as beyond what's necessary for self-defense, especially once the officer was already incapacitated.\n\nMoral conflict is part of the question. The author feels bad about the damage but also had a legitimate fear of being shot. The situation is a tough spot. However, in many legal systems, the use of force must be proportionate and stop once the threat is neutralized. If she continued to hit him after he was down and not a threat, that could be considered excessive.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because she used more force than necessary after the officer was already injured. However, her disabilities and the officer's initial aggressive behavior complicate the issue. But legally and morally, continuing to attack after the threat is neutralized is usually seen as wrong.\n"
