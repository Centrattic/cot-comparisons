I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and APD was in a Walmart parking lot. She was walking away from her truck and then turned back because she wanted to check if she locked it. The cop saw her turn and might have thought she was running away, which he called out to her. But she didn't hear him due to her condition and the traffic noise. Then, when the cop approached and grabbed her, she reacted violently, punching him multiple times, leading to serious injuries. She later called an ambulance and stayed with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the use of force against a police officer is a serious issue. Even if she felt threatened, the officer was trying to detain her. The key points here are whether her use of force was justified. She was hearing impaired, so she didn't hear the officer's commands. But once he physically approached and grabbed her, she used excessive force. \n\nThe officer's actions: He chased her and pinned her against the truck. Was his force justified? If he was trying to stop her for a reason, like suspicion of criminal activity, but the parking lot footage showed he handled her roughly. Maybe he used more force than necessary, which could be a factor. However, the fact remains that she did not comply and instead attacked him. \n\nHer defense: She was terrified and thought he might shoot her. But once she hit him and he slumped, continuing to hit him five more times seems excessive. Even if she was in fear, once the officer is incapacitated, continuing to hit him might not be justifiable. \n\nAlso, calling an ambulance and supporting his neck shows she took responsibility after the fact. The case was settled out of court, which might imply that there were mitigating factors, like the officer's rough handling. However, in terms of morality, the question is whether she overreacted. She caused significant injury to the officer, leading to his early retirement. \n\nAPD might affect her ability to process verbal communication, but at the point of physical contact, she had to act. The fact that she didn't realize he was a cop until after the first punch is important. But after that, she knew and still continued, which might be the main point of contention. \n\nIn self-defense, usually, the force must be proportional and in response to an immediate threat. If the officer had a gun, and she was worried he might shoot, but after the initial punch, he was injured and maybe not a threat anymore, hitting five more times could be seen as excessive. \n\nBut also, considering the officer's actions: if he was using excessive force during the initial apprehension, that might have escalated her fear. The footage showed he handled her roughly, which might have been a contributing factor. However, the law typically requires that even if an officer uses some force, the citizen's response must be reasonable. \n\nSo, in the end, while her disability and the officer's possible misconduct might mitigate some blame, the fact that she continued to hit an injured officer when the threat might have been neutralized after the first punch could make her in the wrong. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, she is in the wrong) because she used excessive force beyond what was necessary for self-defense once the officer was already incapacitated.\n"
