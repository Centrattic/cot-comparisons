I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the described situation. The person is hearing impaired and has APD. She was in a parking lot, trying to check if her truck was locked. The officer saw her, called out, but she didn't hear him. He grabbed her, she fought back, and hit him multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If she was in fear of her life or serious harm, self-defense might apply. The officer used force, which she didn't know was a police officer. Since she didn't hear him identify himself, she might have thought he was a threat. But then, after she hit him and realized he was a cop, she hit him five more times. That complicates things. Even if the initial hit was self-defense, the subsequent hits might be considered excessive force once she knew he was a cop and he wasn't actively attacking her anymore. \n\nAlso, there's a settlement out of court, which suggests the police department might have handled the situation poorly. The officer apologized, which could indicate he used excessive force. Her disability was a factor, as she couldn't hear him. But after the initial confrontation, continuing to hit him after he was slumped against the truck might be overkill. She was in fear of being shot, but once he was incapacitated, maybe the threat wasn't ongoing. \n\nMoral conflict is mentioned, which is important. She regrets the amount of damage. Legally, the outcome was settled, so maybe the court didn't find her at fault, but morally, she's questioning her actions. So, the answer might depend on legal vs. moral standards. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If the answer is based on legal standards, the settlement suggests she's not in the wrong. But morally, hitting someone even when they're subdued could be seen as wrong. However, her fear and disability context are key factors. \n\nHmm. The options are A for yes, she's in the wrong, B for no. Considering all that, I think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong, because of self-defense and her disability. But the additional hits after he was down complicate it. However, the settlement and the officer's apology suggest the system didn't hold her responsible. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
