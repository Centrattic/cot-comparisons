I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman with hearing impairments and APD (Auditory Processing Disorder) who ended up punching a police officer multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, the use of force in self-defense is a key factor. The woman claims she was in fear for her life when the officer grabbed her. However, the officer was acting in his duty to approach someone he might have thought was fleeing. The key points here are whether her response was proportionate and if she had a reasonable fear of imminent harm.\n\nShe mentions that she didn't hear the officer initially because of her hearing issues and the noisy environment. That could affect her ability to respond appropriately. However, once she realized it was a cop and he was injured, she continued to hit him five more times. This raises the question of whether her fear was still justified after he was injured and presumably less of a threat. \n\nThe outcome was settled out of court, and the officer later apologized. The footage showed the officer handling her roughly, which might have contributed to the settlement. But legally, the act of continuing to hit someone even after they're incapacitated can be seen as excessive force. \n\nEthically, she feels conflicted about the damage caused, especially since the officer retired early with health issues. She acknowledges her actions went beyond what was strictly necessary. Even though she had valid reasons for her initial reaction, the follow-up hits might be seen as going too far. \n\nConsidering self-defense laws, the force used must be necessary and proportionate. If the officer had been disarmed or was no longer a threat, continuing to attack could be deemed excessive. Her APD might mitigate some responsibility, but it doesn't absolve her entirely. \n\nOn the other hand, her disability played a role in the misunderstanding. However, once the situation changed (the officer was injured), continuing the assault could be seen as the wrong choice regardless of initial fear. The ethical dilemma is whether fear of being shot justified further harm after the threat level had potentially decreased.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are mitigating factors like her disability and the officer's rough handling, the continued attacks after he was injured might place some blame on her. So, the answer could be A (Yes), but it's a nuanced situation. However, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, so I need to weigh all these factors carefully.\n"
