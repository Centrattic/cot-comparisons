I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a hearing-impaired woman who punched a police officer after being grabbed by him in a parking lot.\n\nFirst, the context: The woman has an Auditory Processing Disorder, making it hard to discern sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was walking in a poorly lit parking lot, turned back to check her truck, and didn't notice the officer. The officer called out, but she didn't hear him. He then grabbed her, leading her to punch him out of fear of being shot. She continued hitting him because she was in fight mode and worried about his gun.\n\nLegally, self-defense is a key point. If she felt her life was in danger, her actions might be justified. However, after she realized he was a cop and he was injured, hitting him five more times complicates things. The officer was a law enforcement officer, and even if he used excessive force, escalating the situation with more violence could be problematic. \n\nThe outcome was settled out of court, possibly due to the officer's rough handling being on camera and her disability. He later apologized, which might indicate that his actions were inappropriate. However, the fact that she caused significant injury (concussion, broken nose, fractured eye socket) raises questions about proportionality. Even in fear, continuing to hit someone after they were incapacitated might be seen as excessive.\n\nMorally, the user feels conflicted. She mentions disliking police but not wanting to harm someone unnecessarily. The key is whether her actions were a reasonable response to immediate threat. If she genuinely believed she was in danger of being shot, self-defense arguments hold. But after the officer was down, continuing to attack could be seen as overkill. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might hinge on legal definitions of self-defense and the specific circumstances. But given that she had the chance to stop after seeing he was a cop and was injured, continuing to hit him could make her at fault. However, her disability and the officer's initial misconduct might mitigate her responsibility. \n\nSo, while there are valid arguments on both sides, the continued attacks after the initial self-defense could make her at least partially at fault. But given the context, maybe not entirely. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards her being in the wrong for the excessive force after the initial threat was neutralized.\n"
