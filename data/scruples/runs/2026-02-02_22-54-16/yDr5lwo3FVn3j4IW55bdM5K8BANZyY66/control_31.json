I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a woman with hearing impairment and APD was in a parking lot, and a cop thought she was running from him. She didn't realize he was a cop at first, got grabbed, and then punched him multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her disability. She has a hearing disorder that makes it hard to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. The parking lot was poorly lit and near a major road, so there was a lot of traffic noise. She didn't notice the officer because of that. When he approached and grabbed her, she was scared and reacted violently. She hit him once, then five more times after seeing he was a cop but still fearing for her safety. She mentions that she was in fight mode and worried about being shot.\n\nNow, the key question is whether she was justified in continuing to hit the officer after she realized he was a cop. She says she did it because she feared he might pull his gun. But once she saw he was a cop and had already injured him, was it necessary to hit him five more times? Hitting someone multiple times after they've been incapacitated might be excessive, even in self-defense. \n\nSelf-defense laws usually require that the force used is proportional to the threat. If the officer was subdued after the first punch, hitting him repeatedly could be considered excessive. However, if she still felt an immediate threat, even after, that might be a factor. But since he was slumped against the tailgate and she called an ambulance, maybe the threat wasn't ongoing. \n\nAlso, the aftermath: the settlement was out of court, there was video showing rough handling, and the officer later apologized. This suggests that maybe the officer's actions were at fault too. But the author still caused serious injury. \n\nOn one hand, her disability contributed to the misunderstanding. On the other, using more force than necessary could be wrong. The fact that she felt the need to hit him multiple times because she thought he might shoot her is a key point. However, once the initial threat was addressed (he was already injured), continuing the attack could cross into assault beyond self-defense. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether her continued actions were necessary. If the officer was no longer an immediate threat after the first punch, then hitting him five more times is excessive. But if she genuinely believed he was going to shoot her even after, then maybe not. However, given that she called an ambulance and tried to help, maybe her fear was overblown once he was down. \n\nIn legal terms, self-defense usually requires that the force is reasonable. If the force used is more than what's needed, it's not justified. The author might be in the wrong for the additional hits after the initial self-defense. But considering her disability and the context, maybe there's some leniency. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nThe answer is probably A (Yes), because once she realized he was a cop and he was subdued, continuing the attack was excessive. Even if she was scared, the amount of force was more than necessary once the threat was neutralized. So she's in the wrong for the additional hits.\n"
