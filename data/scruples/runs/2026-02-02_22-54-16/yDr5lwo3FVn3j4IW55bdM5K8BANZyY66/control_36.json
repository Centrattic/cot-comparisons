I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for punching a cop more than necessary. The situation involves a hearing-impaired individual who had a misunderstanding with a police officer. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The person has APD, which affects their ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. They were in a dimly lit parking lot, heard traffic noise, and didn't realize the officer was talking to them. When the officer approached and grabbed them, they felt threatened and responded with violence. \n\nThe key points here are self-defense and excessive force. The person claims they were in fear of being shot, so their initial punch was self-defense. However, continuing to hit the officer after realizing he was a cop and already injured raises questions. Even if they felt threatened, using more force than necessary could be considered excessive.\n\nBut there's also the context of the officer's actions. The video showed the officer handling them roughly. If the officer used excessive force initially, that might justify the person's fear. However, the person's continued attacks caused significant injury. \n\nLegally, self-defense typically requires that the force used is proportional to the threat. If the officer wasn't using lethal force and the person continued to hit him, that might cross the line. Also, the aftermath shows the officer retired early due to injuries, which the person feels guilty about.\n\nMoral responsibility: While the person's actions were in self-defense initially, hitting multiple times after the threat might have been neutralized could be seen as wrong. The person's intention to cause harm beyond necessary defense is a factor. Even with their disability, there's a responsibility to de-escalate once the immediate threat is addressed.\n\nIn conclusion, the person might not be the asshole because their initial reaction was due to fear and disability, but continuing to hit the officer after the threat was neutralized could make them partially at fault. However, given the officer's rough handling and the person's state of fear, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but with nuances.\n"
