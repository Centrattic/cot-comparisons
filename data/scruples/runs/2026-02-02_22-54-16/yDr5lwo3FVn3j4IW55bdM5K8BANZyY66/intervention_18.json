I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a hearing-impaired woman who had an altercation with a police officer. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author has Auditory Processing Disorder, which affects her ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a dark parking lot near a busy road. She turned back to check if she locked her truck, which the officer might have misinterpreted as her running away. The officer called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear him due to the noise and her condition. He grabbed her, leading her to punch him out of fear of being shot. She hit him multiple times even after realizing he was a cop, but then called an ambulance.\n\nNow, considering the legal and moral aspects. Legally, using force in self-defense can be justified if someone reasonably believes they are in danger. Since she couldn't hear the officer and felt threatened, her reaction might be seen as self-defense. However, the excessive force (multiple punches after he was already injured) might be questionable. Morally, the question is whether her response was proportionate. She had a disability that impaired her ability to perceive the situation correctly. The officer's rough handling likely contributed to the escalation. The fact that the incident was settled out of court and the officer apologized might indicate that the system found her actions understandable given the circumstances. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once she realized he was a cop, continuing to hit him could be excessive. But given her fear of being shot and the traumatic situation, her actions might be seen as a panic response. The outcome was settled without a public trial, suggesting that her defense had merit. The author's remorse and the officer's apology also support the idea that the situation was complex and not entirely her fault. Considering all these factors, it seems the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
