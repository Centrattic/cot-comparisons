I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 24-year-old woman with hearing impairment and Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). She explains that she has trouble processing sounds, especially in noisy environments. She was in a Walmart parking lot, which is near a major road with a lot of traffic noise. She pressed her keyfob to lock her truck but didn't see the lights flash because she was too far away. Worried about whether she locked it, she decided to walk back to check. There was an officer in the parking lot, and from his perspective, she might have looked like she was running away from him. However, the author didn't notice the officer and was just moving to be closer to her truck. The officer called out that he was a cop, but she didn't hear due to the traffic noise and her APD. He then grabbed her arm and pinned her against the truck. The author yanked free and punched him in the temple. She then hit him five more times in the head, fearing he might pull his gun. She ended up causing significant injuries, and later called an ambulance, supporting his neck until help arrived. The case was settled out of court, with footage showing the officer handled her roughly. The officer eventually privately apologized, and the author feels conflicted because she believes she might have overreacted despite her fear.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. She had a disability that affects her auditory processing, which might have contributed to her not hearing the officer's announcement. The officer approached her, grabbed her arm, and pinned her against the truck. The author perceived this as a threat, leading her to strike him in self-defense. However, she continued hitting him after he was already injured, which raises an ethical question.\n\nIn law, self-defense typically allows for the use of reasonable force to protect oneself from immediate harm. However, the key here is whether the force used was excessive once the threat had been neutralized. The officer's actions might have been perceived as aggressive or threatening, especially given the context of being in a dark parking lot and the author's fear. However, the officer was performing his duty, and the author's continued attacks after the officer had been subdued (he slumped against the tailgate) could be considered excessive. The officer was not pointing a gun at her, and once he was incapacitated, there was no ongoing threat. Hitting him five more times in the head after the initial punch might be seen as overkill, even if she was in fear of being shot later.\n\nMoral considerations are also important. While the officer's rough handling was inappropriate and possibly contributed to the situation, the author's decision to hit him multiple times after he was already injured could be viewed as unnecessary. She mentions that she's opposed to violence outside of self-defense or sport, which adds to her internal conflict. The fact that she called an ambulance and tried to help after the fact shows remorse, but the initial escalation raises questions about proportionality.\n\nThe settlement out of court and the officer's apology might indicate that there was some fault on both sides. The officer used rough tactics, and the author's reaction, while understandable given her fear and disability, led to serious harm. The author's continued attacks, even after the officer was down, could be morally questionable because it went beyond what's necessary to stop an immediate threat.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, the author might be in the wrong for using excessive force after the threat was neutralized. However, her disability and the officer's conduct complicate the situation. The answer might depend on the specific laws and context, but generally, once the officer was incapacitated and not posing an immediate threat, hitting him multiple times could be seen as over the top. Therefore, she might be considered to have overreacted, making her the asshole.\n"
