I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman with hearing impairment who punched a police officer multiple times after being grabbed. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman has APD, which makes processing sounds difficult, especially in noisy environments. She was in a parking lot, didn't notice the officer, turned back to check her truck. The officer saw her and thought she was running away, approached her, grabbed her arm, pinned her. She panicked, punched him, and then continued hitting him even after realizing he was a cop.\n\nThe legal and moral aspects here are important. The user is asking if she's wrong. In terms of the law, using force against a police officer is generally not justified unless there's imminent threat of harm. Even self-defense can be tricky when it comes to law enforcement. The fact that she hit him multiple times after he was already injured might be an issue. She acknowledges that she hit him more than necessary, leading to serious injuries.\n\nThe officer's actions\u2014grabbing and pinning her\u2014could be seen as excessive force, especially if the evidence shows that. The parking lot footage might support her side. However, she did use significant force in response. Even if she felt threatened, continuing to hit him after he was incapacitated might be considered excessive self-defense. The part where she kept hitting him even when she realized he was a cop is a moral conflict she mentions. \n\nAlso, the settlement out of public court and the officer's private apology suggest that there were mitigating factors. But legally, the question is whether her response was proportional. In many places, using deadly force against a non-lethal threat isn't justified. Since she caused serious injury, even if it was in self-defense, the amount of force might be questioned. \n\nHer own admission that she hit him more than needed and the aftermath of his early retirement due to her actions points to her responsibility. While she had a valid reason to fear being shot, the continued attacks after he was down might tip the scales in the opinion of many. So, morally and legally, she might be considered in the wrong for using excessive force beyond what was necessary for self-defense. \n\nAnswer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
