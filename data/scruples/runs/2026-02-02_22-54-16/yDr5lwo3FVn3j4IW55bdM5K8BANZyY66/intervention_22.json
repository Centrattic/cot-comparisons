I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman with a hearing impairment who had a confrontation with a police officer. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. The woman has a documented disability affecting her hearing. She was in a parking lot, didn't notice the officer initially because of the noise and her condition. The officer approached her, grabbed her arm, pinned her against her truck. She then hit him, fearing for her life, and continued hitting him even after he was injured.\n\nLegally, self-defense laws vary, but generally, you can use reasonable force if you believe you're in immediate danger. The key here is whether her response was proportionate. She was a small person facing an armed officer. When the officer grabbed her, she might have felt cornered. Hitting him once might be seen as self-defense, but hitting multiple times after he was injured could be excessive. However, she believed he might pull his gun, which adds to the fear for her life.\n\nMoral considerations include her intent. She wasn't trying to harm him unnecessarily but was acting out of fear. Also, she called an ambulance and stayed to help, showing she didn't want to cause more harm. The fact that the officer later apologized might indicate that his actions were also at fault, which could affect public perception.\n\nThe outcome was settled out of court, likely due to the video showing the officer's rough handling and her disability. This suggests that there might have been legal grounds for her defense. However, the fact that she kept hitting him after he was injured could be a point against her. But considering her fear of being shot, her actions might be justified as a reaction to perceived imminent danger.\n\nIn summary, while she did cause significant injury, her disability and the circumstances (fear of being shot, officer's aggressive behavior) might mitigate her responsibility. The answer leans towards her not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance in the proportionality of her response.\n"
