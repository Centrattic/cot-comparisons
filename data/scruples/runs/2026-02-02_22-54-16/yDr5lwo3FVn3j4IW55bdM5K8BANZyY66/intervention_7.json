I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for punching a cop multiple times. The situation involves the author being hearing impaired and having APD, which affects their ability to process sounds, especially in noisy environments.\n\nFirst, the officer approached the author in a parking lot. The author was walking back to their truck because they were worried about locking it. The officer thought the author was fleeing, so he grabbed them. The author didn't realize the officer was a cop until the confrontation, which is where their APD might have played a role in not hearing the officer's announcement.\n\nNow, the key points here are self-defense and the use of excessive force. When the officer grabbed the author, they felt threatened and responded with a punch, which could be justified as self-defense. However, after the initial punch, the author continued to hit the officer even after realizing he was a cop. That raises questions about whether the force was still necessary once the threat level changed.\n\nThe author sustained injuries to the officer, including a broken nose and fractured eye socket. The officer later apologized, and the case was settled out of court. The author's disability was a factor in the situation, as the officer's rough handling and the author's difficulty in processing auditory cues led to a misunderstanding.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral considerations, self-defense typically allows for proportional force to stop an immediate threat. However, if the threat is neutralized, continuing to attack could be considered excessive. The author was in a state of fear, possibly in fight-or-flight mode, which might explain the overreaction. However, once the officer was subdued after the first punch, continuing to hit him might not have been necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the officer's actions\u2014grabbing and pinning the author\u2014could be seen as excessive force, especially in a case where the author's disability contributed to the misunderstanding. The author's actions might be viewed as a response to an unjustified threat, even if the force used was more than necessary. The fact that the case was settled out of court and the officer's subsequent apology supports the idea that the officer's actions were questionable.\n\nConsidering all factors, while the author did use more force than necessary after the initial punch, the overall context\u2014disability, fear of being shot, and the officer's initial aggression\u2014might mitigate the blame. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, continuing to hit the officer after the threat was neutralized could be considered excessive. But morally, given the circumstances and the officer's actions, it's a complex situation. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and based on the analysis, I might lean towards that as well, but there's a nuance here. The answer might depend on jurisdiction and specific self-defense laws, but the situation's context supports the author's perspective.\n"
