Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is a Valentine's Day fight where the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to them missing part of their plans and a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special day, adjusting work to have time together. The girlfriend went to a bar before the date, brought more drinks, and became too intoxicated. The author tried to reason with her but she ignored the warnings. They ended up spending a lot of money on a fancy dinner and a show they couldn't attend because she was too drunk. The argument happened when she accused him of ruining the date, and he expressed frustration over the wasted time and money. She then kicked him out and wants him to move out.\n\nNow, considering the details. The key points are the girlfriend's actions. She went to the bar, drank more despite his concerns, and became so drunk that she couldn't enjoy their plans. The author tried to be understanding, even drove far for the restaurant and show. But she was the one who didn't follow through. He's angry about the money and time, but it's her choices that led to the situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? He made plans to celebrate, communicated his concerns, and tried to accommodate her. She, on the other hand, disregarded his efforts and her own actions caused the problem. While he did get angry, which is a valid reaction, the responsibility for the wasted plans lies with her. Therefore, the author isn't the one at fault here. Answer B.\n"
