Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk. The author planned a special day, changed his work schedule to be with her, and they had a fight afterward.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was already tipsy when she came home, which the author noticed. He was annoyed because he had a nice date planned. Then, she continued drinking beer in the car on the way to the expensive restaurant. Even though the author asked if it was a good idea, she said it was fine. At the restaurant, she got very drunk, slurred her words, and ended up struggling to stand. They went to a show next, but she passed out in the car, and the author left without her. The fight happened when she claimed he left against her wishes, and he got angry about the wasted money and time. Now she's telling him to move out.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Let's break it down. The author made a special effort to be there for her, planning a costly date. The girlfriend's actions led to the date not going as planned. She continued drinking despite the author's concerns, which could have been risky. However, the author also left the show without her, even though she was asleep. Maybe he should have waited longer or handled the situation differently. But he also had paid for VIP tickets, and she didn't show up. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. He spent money and time, and she was clearly not in a condition to enjoy the events. He tried to handle it patiently but eventually snapped. However, when she blamed him, maybe he could have communicated better instead of yelling. But the question is whether he's the asshole. The girlfriend's behavior was definitely a problem, getting drunk and causing the date to be ruined. The author's anger might be justified, but he did leave her alone when she was drunk. Still, the main issue seems to be her actions leading to the problems. The author might have overreacted, but the primary fault is hers. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
