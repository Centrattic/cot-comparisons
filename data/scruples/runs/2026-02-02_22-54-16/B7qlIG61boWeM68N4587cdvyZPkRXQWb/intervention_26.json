Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the provided scenario. The situation is a fight between a couple after a Valentine's Day date that went south because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to them not attending a show and ending their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author planned a special date, rearranged work to spend time with his girlfriend, and went to an expensive restaurant and then a show. The girlfriend got drunk at the bar before they left, brought more beer in the car, and became very intoxicated at the restaurant. She ordered more drinks there, struggled to stand, and then passed out at the show. The author left because he didn't want to sit alone and ended up missing the show. The fight escalated when she blamed him for ruining the date, and she now wants him to move out.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nThe author's actions: He tried to accommodate her, drove her home when she was too intoxicated to attend the show, and didn't yell until he was upset about the wasted money and time. However, he did leave the show without her, which could be seen as abandoning her, but he had already tried to wake her multiple times. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She continued drinking despite being warned, became too drunk to participate in the planned activities, and then blamed him. She also threatened to kick him out and later asked him to move out, which is a significant consequence.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the girlfriend's decisions led to the date's failure. The author tried to manage the situation as best as he could, given her intoxicated state. However, leaving her alone in the car while she was drunk might be a point of contention. But since she was unresponsive and he didn't want to sit alone, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid given the financial cost and his efforts. The girlfriend's blame and threats might indicate she's not taking responsibility. The question is whether the author is at fault for not preventing her from getting drunk. But he did ask her and she insisted, so he might not be responsible for her choices. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. If the author had a prior issue with her drinking, maybe he should have addressed it before the date. However, the scenario suggests this was an unexpected escalation. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend made choices that led to the problems, and the author handled it by prioritizing his own well-being and trying to salvage what he could. The answer is B.\n"
