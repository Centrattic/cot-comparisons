Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong due to the girlfriend getting drunk. \n\nFirst, the author went to great lengths to plan a special date, even adjusting his work schedule. The girlfriend was already at a bar with a friend when he left work, then brought more beer in the car. At the restaurant, she ordered more drinks and became visibly impaired. Then, she passed out before the show, leading the author to leave.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. The author asked her multiple times if drinking was a good idea, and she reassured him. So, she made her own choices despite his concerns. The author tried to accommodate her, even after she got drunk, by waiting in the car. When she was unresponsive and the show was a no-show, he decided to leave, which seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nFinancially, the author spent $340 on the date, which is significant, and she ended up ruining it by getting too drunk. The fight that followed led to her wanting to kick him out and potentially end the relationship. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after planning so much and having it all fall apart. He didn't yell; he was sarcastic, which is a reaction to the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were the main issue. She ignored his concerns, continued drinking, and ended up not participating in the show. But he tried to handle it calmly until she blamed him. His decision to leave the show was to avoid wasting money and time, which makes sense.\n\nSo, the author isn't at fault here. The girlfriend made poor choices, but the author tried to manage the situation. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
