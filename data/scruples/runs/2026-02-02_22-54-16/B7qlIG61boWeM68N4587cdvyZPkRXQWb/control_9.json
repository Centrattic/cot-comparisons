Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to the author cutting the plans short and a subsequent fight. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author went to a lot of effort to make the day special. They rearranged their work schedule to have the day off, planned an expensive dinner and a show. The girlfriend, however, was drinking before the date started. She got tipsy at home, brought more beer in the car, and then more cocktails at the restaurant. By the time they got to the show, she was too drunk and passed out, leading the author to leave early. The fight happened because she accused him of ruining the date, even though he tried to accommodate her by letting her nap.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author did warn her about drinking and she insisted it was okay. He tried to be understanding, letting her have time to nap. When she was still too drunk, he made the choice to leave, which seems reasonable since they had a show to attend. However, the argument that followed was heated, with the author expressing frustration about the money and time wasted. The girlfriend then wants him to move out.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? The main issue is whether he overreacted. He tried to handle the situation calmly, but when his plans were ruined due to her actions, he expressed his anger. However, yelling and sarcastic remarks could be seen as harsh. On the other hand, he had a right to be upset about the financial loss and the effort he put in. The girlfriend's behavior was a significant factor, but the author's response to the situation might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nBut the question is if the author is the asshole. The girlfriend's excessive drinking and then blaming him might make her the main issue. The author tried to accommodate her, but when that failed, he left. His anger seems justified given the circumstances. However, the way he handled the argument (sarcastic thanks, blowing up) might be seen as harsh. But considering the context, the main fault lies with her for getting too drunk and ruining the plans. The author did what he could, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
