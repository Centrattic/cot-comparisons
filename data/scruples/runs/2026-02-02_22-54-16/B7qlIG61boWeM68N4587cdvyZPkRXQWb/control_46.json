Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the setup: The couple had a Valentine's Day plan. The author worked around their schedule to have a day off. The girlfriend went to a bar with a friend while he was at work, came home tipsy, drank more during the drive to the restaurant, and then even more at the restaurant. By the time they went to the show, she was too drunk and passed out. The author left the show alone, and there was a fight later. She's now telling him to move out.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author tried to plan a special date, but the girlfriend's drinking choices ruined it. She ignored his concerns about her drinking, even after he asked her multiple times. The author had to make a decision when she was passed out in the car, and he left the show alone. He was clearly frustrated and felt wronged because of the money and time spent. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he did ask her if drinking was a good idea, and she reassured him. So he tried to communicate. When she became too drunk and then passed out, he tried to wake her up but she was unresponsive. He gave her time to nap, but she was still not okay. The show was expensive, and he didn't want to sit alone. His decision to leave seems reasonable. The fight that followed was because of the situation, not necessarily his initial decision. \n\nOn her side, she went against the plans by drinking excessively despite knowing it would affect the date. She blamed him for the issues, which could be seen as her not taking responsibility. The argument about the fake conversation where she claimed he said he'd wait for her\u2014if that didn't happen, then she's lying or misremembering, which adds to the problem. \n\nThe author's frustration is justified because he put effort into planning a special day, and her actions derailed it. He's not the one who started the fight, but the fight happened because of the stress of the situation. However, his reaction of yelling and sarcastically thanking her might be a bit harsh, but it's a result of the buildup of the day's events. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it's a mix of both. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he tried to prevent her from over-drinking and she didn't listen, he's not entirely responsible. Her actions were the main cause of the problem. The author's decisions to leave the show and end the day were practical given the circumstances. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
