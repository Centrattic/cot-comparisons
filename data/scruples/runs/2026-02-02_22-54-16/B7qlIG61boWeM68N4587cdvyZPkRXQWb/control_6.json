Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario is a fight between a couple after a Valentine's Day date that went poorly. The author is the one posting the story, seeking to know if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author planned a special date, rearranged his work schedule to be off, and they went to an expensive restaurant and a show. The girlfriend drank alcohol before and during the date, leading to her being too drunk to attend the show. The author left the show alone and later got into a fight, expressing frustration about the wasted money and time. The girlfriend then blames him and wants him to move out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's alcohol consumption, the author's reaction, and the aftermath. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author tried to make a special occasion. He was annoyed when she was already tipsy before the date and she continued drinking in the car. He asked her a couple of times if it was a good idea, but she insisted. Then she got increasingly drunk, leading to her being unable to attend the show. The author left alone, which the girlfriend later claims he didn't inform her about, but he says she told him she'd follow after resting. She didn't, and then blamed him for ruining the date.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. The girlfriend chose to drink before and during the date despite the author's concerns. The author tried to reason with her but followed her decisions. When she became too drunk, the show was a lost cause. The author's frustration seems justified given the effort and money spent. The girlfriend's reaction of blaming him and wanting to end the relationship might be her issue, but the author's anger stems from her actions, not the other way around.\n\nPossible angles where the author might be wrong: Did he push her to stop drinking? Did he take enough steps to prevent her from getting too drunk? But according to the story, he asked her a couple of times if it was okay, and she insisted. So he tried to make her aware but let her decide. That seems reasonable. Also, leaving the show alone because she was too drunk might not be entirely his fault. It's understandable that he didn't want to sit alone in VIP, but maybe he could have found a solution, but it's also a valid choice to leave.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions led to the date being ruined. She drank despite the author's concerns. The author's anger is in response to her behavior, not the other way around. So the author isn't necessarily wrong here. The girlfriend's reaction seems more extreme, but the question is whether the author is the asshole. Since the main issue was her actions and his reaction to them, he's not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
