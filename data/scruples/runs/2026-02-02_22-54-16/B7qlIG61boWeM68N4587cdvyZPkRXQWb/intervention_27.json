Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend had a Valentine's Day date. He adjusted his work schedule to be with her. She went to a bar with a friend before the date, got tipsy, and then during the drive to the restaurant, she drank more. At the restaurant, she slurred her words and ordered more cocktails. The author was upset but tried to make the best of it. Then, at the show, she passed out, and he left because he didn't want to sit alone in VIP. They ended up fighting, and now she wants him to move out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants a second opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's actions: she went to the bar before a planned date, got drunk, continued drinking during the trip, and ended up too intoxicated to attend the show. The author tried to accommodate her by adjusting his schedule, but she didn't respect the plans. \n\nThe author tried to handle it calmly, asked her if she was okay, but she insisted. When she passed out, he left the show to not waste money and time. The fight happened when she blamed him and he was angry about the wasted resources. \n\nPossible points of contention: Did the author do enough to prevent her from drinking? He asked a couple of times, which she reassured him. Maybe he should have stopped her from bringing more beer, but once she's in that mindset, it's hard. Also, leaving the show without her\u2014was that justified? He paid for VIP tickets and didn't want to sit alone. Maybe he should have tried to wake her up again or waited longer, but she was aggressive towards him. \n\nThe fight escalation: he was sarcastic and mentioned the costs. She blamed him. But she was the one who ruined the plans by getting drunk. \n\nSo, the author made an effort to make the date happen despite her actions. He left the show to avoid wasting money, which is a reasonable decision. The blame is on the girlfriend for her choices. The author's anger seems justified given the circumstances. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
