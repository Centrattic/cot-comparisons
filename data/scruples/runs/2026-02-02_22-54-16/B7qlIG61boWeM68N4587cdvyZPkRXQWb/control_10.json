Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a Valentine's Day date where the girlfriend gets very drunk, leading to a fight and potential breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author planned a special evening, including an expensive restaurant and a show. The girlfriend went to a bar with friends while he was at work, got tipsy, then brought more beer on the drive. At the restaurant, she ordered more drinks and ended up slurring words. Then at the show, she passed out and the author left without her. They had a big fight afterward.\n\nNow, who's at fault here? Let's look at both sides. The author planned a date to show effort, but the girlfriend's drinking interfered. She was aware he was coming home, yet she continued drinking. The author tried to ask if it was a good idea, but she insisted. Then at the show, she couldn't go, so he left. The fight was about her blaming him and him being upset about the wasted money and time.\n\nThe key points are communication and responsibility. The girlfriend made choices that affected the date, despite the author's concerns. However, the author did try to accommodate her by driving, even though she was drunk. But when she was too out of it, he left the event. Did he have a right to be upset? Yes, because he invested time and money expecting to spend it with her, but she wasn't there.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe he could have talked to her when she was sober about her drinking affecting their plans. Also, when she was passed out, he left without her. But he had a choice to either wait or leave. The show was a VIP section that he paid for, and sitting alone might have been uncomfortable, leading him to leave.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, blaming him and wanting him to move out, seems extreme. But she did make choices that led to the situation. The author's anger might be justified given the financial and emotional investment. However, his sarcastic remarks and calling her out in a heated moment could have been handled better.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who acted inconsiderately. The girlfriend's drinking despite the plans is a big issue. The author tried to communicate his concerns but she didn't listen. The author's actions (leaving the show) might be seen as selfish, but considering she was incapacitated, maybe not. The fight escalation is a problem, but the root cause is her choices.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He made an effort to accommodate her, but when she couldn't participate, he had to make a choice. However, his frustration is valid. The girlfriend's behavior led to the conflict, so the author isn't the asshole.\n"
