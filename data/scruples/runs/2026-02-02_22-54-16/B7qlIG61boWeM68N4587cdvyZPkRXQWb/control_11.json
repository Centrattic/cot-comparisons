Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went poorly because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to the author leaving a show early and a subsequent fight.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author made efforts to plan a special day, adjusting his work schedule to spend time with his girlfriend. He was trying to make it a memorable occasion. However, the girlfriend went to a bar before the date, brought alcohol to the restaurant, and kept drinking, leading to her being too intoxicated to attend the show. \n\nThe author tried to accommodate her, even though she was already drunk. He asked her if drinking was a good idea, and she insisted it was fine. When she became too drunk, he left the show alone, which he admits wasn't fun without her. The fight happened because she blamed him for leaving, even though he had paid for the tickets and didn't want to sit alone. \n\nNow, considering responsibility: the girlfriend made choices to drink excessively despite the author's concerns. However, the author could have intervened more firmly. For example, maybe he should have stopped her from bringing alcohol or insisted she stop drinking once she was already impaired. But the girlfriend's actions were the direct cause of the problems. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He planned the date, spent money, and tried to make it work even when things weren't going well. The fight escalated when she blamed him, which he found unfair. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He did his part to plan and adjust. The main issue was her alcohol consumption. However, maybe he could have been more proactive in preventing her from getting too drunk. But given the description, he did ask her, and she ignored his concerns. \n\nTherefore, the main fault lies with the girlfriend. The author's actions were reactive to her choices. He left the show when he couldn't enjoy it, which is reasonable. The fight and her blaming him are her issues. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
