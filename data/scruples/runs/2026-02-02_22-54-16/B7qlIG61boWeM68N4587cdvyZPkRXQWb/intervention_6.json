Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. So the situation is about a couple's Valentine's Day date that went bad because the girlfriend got really drunk. The author is the boyfriend who's wondering if he's the asshole. The choices are A for yes he is, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The boyfriend rearranged his work schedule to have time off for their date. The girlfriend was already tipsy when he got home, then brought more beer in the car. He asked her a couple times if it was a good idea, and she said it was fine. At the restaurant, she got slurred speech and ordered more cocktails. Then at the show, she passed out and he left. They fought on the way home, and she kicked him out and wants him to move out.\n\nSo the main points here are about responsibility and communication. The boyfriend tried to be considerate by adjusting his work, and he asked her if drinking more was okay. She insisted it was fine. However, she continued to drink to the point of being unable to attend the event. The boyfriend left because he didn't want to sit alone in VIP seats. He was upset about the wasted money and time, but was it his fault?\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend made choices to drink despite knowing the plans. She was aware of the expensive restaurant and the show, yet drank excessively. The boyfriend did warn her and tried to get her to stop. On the other hand, maybe he could have been more proactive in stopping her, but he did ask. Also, leaving the show might have been a selfish move, but he didn't want to sit alone. The fight escalated, and he was upset, but he didn't yell until she blamed him.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? The girlfriend's actions led to the problem, but maybe the boyfriend should have handled it differently. However, he did try to accommodate her, and she disregarded his concerns. The author's anger might be justified because she was the one who got drunk and ruined the plans. The answer might be B (not the asshole) because he tried to do the right thing and she was the one who made poor choices despite his efforts.\n"
