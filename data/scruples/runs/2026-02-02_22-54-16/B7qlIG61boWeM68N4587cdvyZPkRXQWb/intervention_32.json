Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Valentine's Day date that went poorly because the girlfriend got too drunk. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author went to great lengths to make this a special date. He adjusted his work schedule to be off, planned a fancy dinner, and a burlesque show. The girlfriend, however, started drinking before they even left for the restaurant. Even though the author warned her about the driving distance and the expensive restaurant, she continued to drink more beer and then cocktails. At the restaurant, she was already slurring her words. Then, at the show, she passed out and ended up in a car nap, leading the author to leave early. The fight happened because the author felt the date was ruined by her actions, and she blamed him for it.\n\nNow, considering responsibility here. The girlfriend's excessive drinking was a choice, and the author had expressed concerns. But did he do anything to prevent it? He asked her a couple of times if she was sure about drinking more, and she reassured him. So he might have thought she was in control. But once she was drunk, he had to deal with the consequences, like leaving the show early. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since he invested money and time. However, he could have considered calling it a night earlier or not going to the show if she was too drunk. But he also tried to make the best of it.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior led to the date being cut short. She wasn't responsible with her drinking, and she blamed him for the outcome. The author's anger might be valid given the circumstances. But he did leave the show without her, which she might see as abandoning her. However, given the tickets were expensive and he didn't want to be alone, maybe that's understandable. \n\nSo is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's not the main cause, but he might have let her drink too much knowing her tendencies. However, he did try to communicate and gave her chances to sober up. The girlfriend's actions directly led to the problems. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
