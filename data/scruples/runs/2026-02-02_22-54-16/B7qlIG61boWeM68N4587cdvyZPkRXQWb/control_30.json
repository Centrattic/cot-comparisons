Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a Valentine's Day date that went south because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to a fight and the threat to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special date, adjusted his work schedule, and spent a significant amount of money on a fancy restaurant and a show. The girlfriend was already tipsy when they started, continued drinking during the drive, and then at the restaurant. She ended up too drunk to attend the show, which cost a lot, and later accused him of ruining the date. The fight happened because of her drinking and the resulting frustration from both sides.\n\nNow, considering accountability. The author did try to manage the situation: he was concerned about her drinking, asked if she was okay, and tried to accommodate her by letting her nap. When she became unresponsive, he made a decision to leave to avoid wasting money and time. His frustration is understandable given the effort and expense invested.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend's actions contributed to the problem. She continued drinking despite being warned, passed out, and blamed him. However, the author could have handled it differently, maybe by setting clearer boundaries earlier or not bringing more beer. But he did try to make the most of the date despite her behavior.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? He was trying to respect her while also protecting the date's value. His anger was a reaction to her actions, but maybe he could have communicated better. However, the main issue seems to stem from her excessive drinking and not respecting the plans. So, the blame isn't entirely on him. The answer is likely B, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
