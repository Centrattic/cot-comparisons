Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went bad because the girlfriend got too drunk. The author planned a special day, moved their work schedule, and they had a fancy dinner and a show. The girlfriend, however, drank a lot before and during the dinner, leading to them not being able to attend the show. The author left the show alone and they ended up fighting, then she wants them to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author tried to plan a nice date, adjusted their work schedule, and spent money on an expensive restaurant and a show. They tried to be understanding when the girlfriend was already tipsy and brought more beer. They even went to the restaurant despite her drinking, and then tried to get her to go to the show but she was too drunk. The author felt frustrated and angry because their plans were ruined due to her drinking. They ended up leaving the show and the fight that followed led to her wanting them to move out.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have a right to drink if she wanted, but maybe she overdid it. The author did mention that once she starts drinking, it's hard to stop her. The girlfriend might not have considered how her actions affected the plans and the money spent. However, the author also could have set boundaries earlier. For example, maybe they should have insisted she stops drinking once she was already tipsy, or not let her bring beer into the car. Also, the author mentioned they asked her a couple of times if it was a good idea to drink, but she reassured them. So maybe the responsibility is shared here. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's frustration is understandable, as they planned something special and had their plans ruined. However, the girlfriend's actions directly led to the situation. The author left the show because they didn't want to sit alone, which might be a bit selfish, but given the context, maybe they had a right to feel it wasn't worth staying. The fight that followed was probably a result of accumulated frustrations. The author's response of being furious and sarcastic could be seen as harsh, but it's a reaction to the situation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend's choice to drink excessively ruined the plans. The author tried to be patient and accommodate her, but there's a point where they have to take responsibility for their own actions. However, the author might have handled it better by communicating their concerns earlier instead of letting it escalate. But overall, the main issue is the girlfriend's actions leading to the ruined date. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might have made some mistakes in how they handled it, but the primary fault is on the girlfriend's side. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
