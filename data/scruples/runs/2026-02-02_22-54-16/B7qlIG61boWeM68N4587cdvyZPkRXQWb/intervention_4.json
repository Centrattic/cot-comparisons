Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no). The main issue here is a fight between a couple after a Valentine's Day date that didn't go as planned because the girlfriend got very drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author planned a special date, moved their work schedule, and arranged for a fancy restaurant and a show. The girlfriend was drinking before the date started, even though the author was concerned. She continued to drink during the drive and at the restaurant, leading to her being too drunk to attend the show. The author left the show alone, then on the way home, they argued. The author was angry about the wasted money and time, and the girlfriend blamed them and asked them to move out.\n\nNow, considering who's in the wrong. The girlfriend consumed alcohol excessively despite the author's concerns, which led to the date being ruined. The author tried to handle it calmly but was clearly frustrated. The girlfriend's reaction was blaming the author, which might not be fair since she made the choice to drink. The author's decision to leave the show and the subsequent argument could be seen as a reasonable response to her actions. However, the author did mention they didn't yell and just left, which is probably not the main issue. The girlfriend's insistence on getting wasted might be the root cause here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation better. Maybe trying to get her to stop drinking earlier or making a different choice when she was too drunk. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions seem to be the main problem, so the author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset and making decisions based on that. The fact that she passed out and was uncooperative might justify the author's frustration. \n\nThe key points are mutual responsibility. The girlfriend's choices led to the problem, but the author could have tried to address it sooner. However, the author isn't the one who kept drinking. The argument later, where the author sarcastically thanked her, might be harsh, but given the context, it's a reaction to her actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
