Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong in their situation. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to them having to cut the plans short and a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author planned a special date, moved his work schedule to be off, and they went to an expensive restaurant and a show. The girlfriend started drinking before the date, continued in the car, and then at the restaurant. She ended up too drunk to attend the show, and the author left, which led to a fight. The girlfriend is now asking him to move out.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's actions. She drank alcohol before and during the date, even when the author was concerned. She didn't follow through with the plans, leading to the date being ruined. The author tried to be accommodating, but she ended up blaming him and got angry about leaving. \n\nNow, considering responsibility. The author made an effort to plan a special date, communicated his concerns about her drinking, and tried to handle the situation (like letting her nap). The girlfriend's actions were the main cause of the date's failure. She didn't consider the effort he put in and took it out on him. \n\nBut wait, the author did leave the show without her. Was that his choice? He mentions that he didn't want to sit alone with VIP tickets, so he left. However, he tried to wake her up multiple times and gave her time to nap. The decision to leave might be a point of contention. But the main issue is her getting drunk and not respecting the plans. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is now blaming him and asking him to move out. That seems like an overreaction. The author didn't force her to drink; he tried to warn her. The fight happened after he expressed frustration about the wasted money and time. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend's actions contributed more to the problem. The author tried to handle it calmly but eventually snapped, which is understandable given the circumstances. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the main issue was her behavior and her not taking responsibility, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
