Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is the asshole (AITA) in their fight with their girlfriend. The scenario is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got too drunk, leading to the date being cut short and a big argument.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author planned a special Valentine's Day. He rearranged his work schedule to spend time with her. They had a fancy restaurant dinner and then a burlesque/circus show. The girlfriend was already tipsy when they met, drank more beer on the drive, and then ordered more cocktails at the restaurant. By the time they got to the show, she was too drunk, passed out, and the author left the show. Then they fought, she blamed him, and she wants him to move out.\n\nThe author is wondering if he was wrong for getting angry and leaving the show. The key points here are the girlfriend's actions versus the author's responses. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she went to the bar with a friend before meeting up, was tipsy when they met, continued drinking in the car despite the author's concerns, and then at the restaurant ordered more alcohol. She ended up too drunk to attend the show. The author tried to manage the situation, but her drinking led to the plans falling apart.\n\nThe author's actions: he tried to accommodate her, asked if she was okay drinking, then left the show when she was incapacitated. He got angry when she accused him of ruining the date, which he points out was a waste of money and time. The fight ended with her wanting him to move out.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. The girlfriend's excessive drinking is a problem here. She was warned by the author but continued to drink. The author had planned a special evening, and her actions disrupted it. However, the author's response was to leave the show and then blow up at her. Was he justified in his anger?\n\nThe author mentions he's not the type to yell, so the blow-up seems to be a reaction to her blaming him and the wasted resources. But was it necessary to yell? Also, leaving the show might have been a mistake because he left her alone when she was drunk. However, he tried to wake her up multiple times and waited for 15 minutes. Maybe he should have handled it differently, like calling a taxi or waiting until she sobered up.\n\nOn the other hand, she was clearly not in a state to attend the show, and he didn't want to waste the VIP ticket alone. His frustration is understandable. The key question is whether he had a duty to stay with her despite her condition, or if her behavior was the main issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of wanting him to move out seems extreme. She blamed him for the situation she caused herself. The author's anger might be justified because she was responsible for the date's failure, not him. However, his response could have been more measured. \n\nIn terms of the AITA aspect, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to be upset and leave the show. Since her actions led to the problem, he's not the one at fault. He tried to handle it by waiting for her to nap, but when she was unresponsive, leaving might have been the only option. The explosion in anger could be seen as a reaction, but the root cause is her actions. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
