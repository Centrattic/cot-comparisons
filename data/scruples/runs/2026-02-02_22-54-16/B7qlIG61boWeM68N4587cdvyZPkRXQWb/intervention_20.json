Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author planned a special Valentine's Day date with his girlfriend. He adjusted his work schedule to be off, and had a nice restaurant and a burlesque/circus show planned. The girlfriend went to the bar with friends, got tipsy, bought more beer in the car, and ended up drunk at the restaurant. Then she got more cocktails there, got so drunk she could barely stand. At the show, she passed out and he decided to leave because he didn't want to be alone. Then there was an argument, and she kicked him out, wants him to move out.\n\nThe author is feeling wronged because he planned this special date, she ruined it by getting drunk, leading to them not attending the show. He argues that he's not the one at fault here. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the actions of both parties. The author made a big effort to plan a special evening. The girlfriend, on her own, went to the bar before the date, got drunk, and continued drinking during the date. She didn't listen to his concerns about her drinking. Then she blamed him for ruining the date when he left the show because she wouldn't attend. \n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The girlfriend made choices that affected the evening's plans. She ignored his warnings about drinking and then acted out when he left the event. The author tried to accommodate her, even after she was clearly intoxicated, but in the end, he had to leave because she wasn't participating. \n\nNow, the author's actions: Did he do anything wrong? He planned the date, tried to handle her drinking with patience, and left the show when it was clear she wasn't going to join. He didn't push her to drink; she made her own choices. He expressed frustration later, but he didn't yell unless provoked. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were the main issue here. She made decisions that led to the date being ruined, and then blamed him. However, maybe the author could have handled the situation differently. For example, could he have tried to get her to sober up before the events, or set clearer boundaries about not drinking during the date? Maybe, but given the circumstances, his decision to leave the show after she was unresponsive seems reasonable. \n\nAlso, the cost of the tickets is a factor. The author mentions that the total was $340, which they can't afford easily. She wasted that money and his time, which is a big deal. He's justified in being upset. \n\nThe fight that followed might be where things escalated. He might have blown up in anger, but the post says he's not the type to yell. So maybe the outburst was a result of her blaming him unfairly. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The main responsibility lies with the girlfriend for her actions. The author tried to manage the situation, but she made choices that ruined the date. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
