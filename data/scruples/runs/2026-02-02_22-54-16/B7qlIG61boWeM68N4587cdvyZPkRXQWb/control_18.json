Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a fight with his girlfriend over her getting too drunk on a special Valentine's Day date.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special day, rearranged his work schedule to be with her, and they had a nice restaurant and a show planned. The girlfriend was already drinking before they even left, bringing more beer in the car, and then more cocktails at the restaurant. By the time they got to the show, she was too drunk and passed out, leading the author to leave early. They ended up fighting, and she now wants him to move out.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from the description, the girlfriend made choices that affected their plans. She drank despite the author's concerns, which led to the date being ruined. The author tried to accommodate her by adjusting his work schedule, but she didn't consider his efforts. When she was too drunk to enjoy the show, he left to avoid wasting money and time. He didn't force her to drink; she chose to get drunk. The fight escalated when she blamed him even though he was trying to salvage the date as long as possible.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled things differently. For example, he could have been more direct about his concerns earlier or set clearer boundaries about drinking before the event. However, the main issue here seems to be the girlfriend's actions leading to the situation. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial and time investment, and he was trying to follow through with her reassurances that she was okay to drink. Since she kept drinking despite his warnings, the blame might lie more with her.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He made reasonable efforts to plan a nice day and followed her assurances. The main responsibility for the ruined date lies with the girlfriend's choices.\n"
