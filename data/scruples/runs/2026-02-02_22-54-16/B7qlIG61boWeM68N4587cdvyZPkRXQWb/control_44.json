Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had plans for a special Valentine's Day. The author adjusted his work schedule to be off, which shows he put effort into making it a good day. The girlfriend went to a bar with her friend before meeting up. She got tipsy and then consumed more alcohol during the drive to the expensive restaurant. The author tried to talk her out of drinking more but she insisted. At the restaurant, she got even more drunk, leading to the show being skipped. The argument happens when the author leaves the show early because she's too drunk to attend, and later she accuses him of ruining the date.\n\nNow, analyzing the key points. The author planned a special date, made sacrifices to be there, and tried to accommodate her despite her drinking. He asked her not to drink more, which she refused. When she became too intoxicated, he couldn't go to the show alone, so he left. The fight happened later, with her blaming him and wanting to end the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Factors to consider: Did he have a responsibility to prevent her from drinking? He did warn her, and she chose to ignore his concerns. The cost of the date being wasted is a factor, but the main issue is her decision to get drunk despite knowing the plans. The author's frustration is understandable, as the plans were ruined not because of his actions but her choices. However, leaving the show alone might be seen as a reasonable decision given the circumstances. \n\nThe girlfriend's reactions\u2014blaming him, wanting to move out, and acting out when she's drunk\u2014are significant. The author's anger is a reaction to the wasted effort and her refusal to take responsibility. In such scenarios, responsibility often lies with the person making the choices that directly caused the problem. Here, it's the girlfriend's decision to drink despite warnings. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
