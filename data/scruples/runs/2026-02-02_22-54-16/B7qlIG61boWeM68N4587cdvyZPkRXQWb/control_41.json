Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe main points are that the couple had a Valentine's date. The author planned things and adjusted their work schedule to spend time with their girlfriend. She went to a bar with a friend, got tipsy, then brought more beer. At the restaurant, she slurred her words and ordered more drinks, leading to her being very drunk. Then at the show, she passed out, and the author left. They had a fight, and she wants them to move out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author tried to plan a special date, adjusted work, and was accommodating even when she was drinking. They warned her about the drinks, and she insisted. The author left the show early because she wasn't attending, which cost money. The fight happened because she blamed the author for ruining the date. \n\nSo, the author's actions: they tried to be considerate, but the girlfriend's choices led to the problems. The author left the show because it wasn't worth attending alone, which seems reasonable. They expressed frustration about the wasted money and time, which is understandable. However, their sarcastic remark might have escalated things. But considering she was drunk and not engaging, maybe their reaction is justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: she chose to drink despite the author's concerns, leading to the date being ruined. She blamed the author instead of taking responsibility. Her reaction of wanting to kick him out and asking him to move out seems extreme compared to her actions.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the author did something wrong. Here, the author didn't force her to drink, tried to plan, and made the best decision given the circumstances. The girlfriend's choices led to the conflict, and the author isn't at fault. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's anything else. Maybe the author could have handled things differently, like being more supportive when she was drunk, but the main issue is her actions. The answer is B.\n"
