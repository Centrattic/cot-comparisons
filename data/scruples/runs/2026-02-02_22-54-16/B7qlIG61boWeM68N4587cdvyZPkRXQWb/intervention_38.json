Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went really wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk. The author tried to plan a special evening, but things fell apart.\n\nFirst, the author moved their work schedule around to have the day off, which shows they were putting effort into making the day special. The girlfriend was at a bar with a friend when he was leaving work. He was annoyed because once she gets a bit drunk, it's hard to stop her, and he had a nice date planned. \n\nShe brought more beer in the car, even though he asked her if it was a good idea. She kept drinking at the expensive restaurant, leading to slurred speech and trouble standing. The author tried to keep going, even though it was clear she was not in the right state. Then, at the show, she passed out and refused to wake up. The author left, not wanting to sit alone in VIP. \n\nThe fight happened when she accused him of not letting her sleep enough to go to the show, which he says didn't happen. He was furious, sarcastically thanked her for the wasted money and time, and now she wants him to move out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author made plans and tried to accommodate her, but she ignored his concerns about her drinking. She kept drinking despite his warnings. The author tried to be patient, even drove her to an expensive restaurant. When she became a liability (slurred speech, struggling to stand), he still tried to make the best of it. When she passed out, he gave her time to rest but she was uncooperative. He left the show because it wouldn't be fun alone, and then they fought when she blamed him. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? He planned a special date, spent money, and she ruined it by over-drinking. He didn't force her to drink; she chose to bring more beer and order cocktails. He tried to manage the situation but had to make a decision to leave. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he should have handled her drinking earlier. Did he do enough to stop her? He asked a couple times if it was a good idea, but she insisted. Maybe he should have been stricter, but if she kept insisting, he might not be responsible for her choices. \n\nAlso, when she passed out, he gave her time, then left. He might have handled that part better, but the show was VIP and he didn't want to sit alone. His frustration is understandable. \n\nThe fight was about blame. She blamed him, but he was the one who left because she was unresponsive. His sarcastic remark was probably a reaction to her blaming him. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he was concerned about her drinking, maybe he should have addressed it more firmly earlier. But she was an adult making her own choices. The author's anger over the wasted money and time is valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue was her over-drinking despite his warnings. He tried to be accommodating, but she made choices that ruined the plans. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
