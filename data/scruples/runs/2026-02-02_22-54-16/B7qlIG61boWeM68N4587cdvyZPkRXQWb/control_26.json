Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author wrote an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario where they and their girlfriend had a fight after a Valentine's Day date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author adjusted their work schedule to spend the day with their girlfriend. They planned a special, expensive date. The girlfriend went to a bar with her friend before the date and got tipsy. She continued drinking during the car ride, leading to slurred speech at the restaurant. Then, she ordered more drinks there, got very drunk, and ended up passing out during the show. The author left the show alone and later got into an argument where the girlfriend blamed him for ruining the date.\n\nNow, considering the details. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The girlfriend chose to drink excessively despite the author's concerns. The author tried to reason with her, but she continued drinking. The date was expensive and planned for a special occasion, which the girlfriend's behavior disrupted. The author's frustration seems justified given the effort and cost involved.\n\nBut wait, was the author wrong in any way? Did they encourage her to drink? The author mentions they asked a couple times if it was a good idea for her to drink more, but she said it was fine. So the author tried to intervene, but she insisted. The author also tried to accommodate her, like letting her nap before the show. When she didn't follow through, they left. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions led to the date being ruined. She drank despite knowing the plans, which required her to be sober enough to enjoy the activities. The author's anger stems from the wasted effort and money, which is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction, kicking the author out and blaming him, seems unfair since the fault lies with her actions. \n\nHowever, relationships involve mutual respect and communication. Maybe the author could have handled the situation differently, like setting clearer boundaries or being more assertive earlier on. But in this case, the author made efforts to accommodate her, and the girlfriend didn't take responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's excessive drinking and not respecting the plans. The author's frustration is valid given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
