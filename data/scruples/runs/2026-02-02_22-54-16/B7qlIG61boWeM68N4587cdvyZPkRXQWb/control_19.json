Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight between a couple after a Valentine's Day date. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the girlfriend got drunk during the date. The author tried to plan a special day, moving their work schedule to be together. The girlfriend was already tipsy when he arrived, then drank more beer in the car and at the restaurant. The author asked her a couple times if it was a good idea, and she said it was fine. Then at the restaurant, she got slurred speech and ordered more drinks, leading to her struggling to stand. The burlesque show part is next where she passes out, the author leaves, and they end up fighting.\n\nThe author is frustrated because the date didn't go as planned due to her drinking. He ends up angry, sarcastic, and they have a big fight. The girlfriend kicks him out, and he's considering moving out. He's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, from what I read, the author tried to make things work. He adjusted his schedule, planned a special date. He asked her if drinking was a good idea, and she said yes. She's the one who kept drinking despite his concerns, leading to her being too drunk to attend the show. The author left because he didn't want to sit alone with the expensive tickets. Then he got angry and sarcastic, but the main issue seems to be the girlfriend's actions leading to the date's failure.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The girlfriend's choices to drink excessively and then act out are her responsibility. The author tried to accommodate her, but she didn't respect his efforts. However, maybe he could have handled it differently, like setting boundaries or not allowing her to drink more. But he did ask her, and she insisted. Also, in the end, he blew up and was sarcastic, which isn't great, but the main cause is her actions. So, probably the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
