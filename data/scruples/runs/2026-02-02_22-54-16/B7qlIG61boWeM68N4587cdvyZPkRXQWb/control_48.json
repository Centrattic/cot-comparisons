Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this story is the asshole in the situation described. So, the author wrote about a fight with his girlfriend after a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because she got too drunk. The key points here are their actions and communication.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special date, adjusted his work schedule to be with her, and they spent a lot of money on a fancy restaurant and a show. The girlfriend was already tipsy when they started, then drank more beer in the car. The author asked if it was a good idea, and she said it was fine. At the restaurant, she got slurred speech and ordered more drinks. Then she passed out at the show, and the author left without her, leading to an argument and her asking him to move out.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions led to them not being able to enjoy the planned date. She didn't respect the plans and her behavior caused the fight. But maybe the author could have set better boundaries earlier. Did he do anything wrong? He did try to talk to her about her drinking before, and she dismissed his concerns. When she got too drunk, he left the show because he didn't want to sit alone. He was annoyed and frustrated, but he didn't force her to drink. The blow-up happened when she blamed him and he was angry. However, he did act in the moment, maybe not handling it calmly. But considering she was the one who got drunk and ruined the plans, he might not be the asshole. So, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
