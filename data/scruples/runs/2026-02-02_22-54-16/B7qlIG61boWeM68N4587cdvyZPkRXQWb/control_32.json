Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo the situation is about a Valentine's Day date gone wrong. The author planned a special day, adjusting his work schedule to spend time with his girlfriend. They went to an expensive restaurant and then a burlesque show. The girlfriend got very drunk, leading to them missing the show and a fight ending with her wanting him to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author tried to plan a nice date, which shows he's considerate. He was concerned about her drinking because it might ruin the plans. The girlfriend was at a bar with friends, then brought beer to the car, drank more at the restaurant, and ended up too drunk to attend the show. She blamed him for ruining the date, and he got angry about the wasted money and time.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. For him to be in the wrong, he would have done something that contributed to the problem. The author did ask her if drinking was a good idea, and she insisted it was. He tried to let her nap before the show but she refused. When she was too drunk, he left the show alone because it wasn't worth it. His frustration is understandable given the cost and time invested. \n\nBut maybe he could have handled things differently. For example, maybe he should have been more proactive in stopping her drinking earlier, but he did ask her a couple of times. However, once she's that drunk, he had to make a decision. Leaving might have been a reasonable choice given the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were the main issue. She chose to drink excessively despite knowing the plans. She blamed him and acted out. Her reaction of wanting him to move out seems extreme. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who went out of control with drinking. He tried to manage the situation. The main problem was her actions. So the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
