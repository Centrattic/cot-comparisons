Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) in this situation.\n\nSo, the main event is the couple's Valentine's Day plans. The author worked to adjust his schedule for a romantic day. He went out of his way to make it special. The girlfriend, however, was already drinking with her friend before they met up. When he got home, she was tipsy. The author was worried because she kept drinking more on the drive to the expensive restaurant. At the restaurant, she ordered more cocktails and ended up very drunk. Then, they were supposed to go to a show, but she passed out and he left because he didn't want to sit alone. She later blamed him for everything and kicked him out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author planned a special day, adjusted his work schedule, and tried to accommodate her despite her drinking. He asked her multiple times if it was okay for her to keep drinking and she said it was fine. When she became too intoxicated and missed the show, he was upset. The girlfriend, on the other hand, drank heavily despite the plans, ended up too drunk to attend the second part of the date, then blamed him and kicked him out.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. The author asked her if it was okay for her to drink, and she agreed each time. Even though he was concerned, he respected her decisions. The girlfriend's actions led to the plans falling apart, and she reacted angrily, blaming him. The author's frustration is understandable given the effort he put into the date and the wasted money and time. He didn't force her to drink; she made her own choices. When she passed out, he tried to wake her and gave her time to nap. His decision to leave the show was pragmatic because attending alone wasn't feasible. Her blaming him and demanding he move out seems excessive, especially since the problem stemmed from her actions.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled the situation better. For instance, if she was clearly too drunk to attend the show, maybe he should have taken her home instead of going to the show. But given that he asked and she insisted it was okay, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior and reaction are more problematic. She didn't take responsibility and instead lashed out. The author's anger is a reaction to her actions, not the cause of them.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
