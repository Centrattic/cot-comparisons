Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. So, first, I need to understand the key points of the story.\n\nThe couple had a planned Valentine's Day date. The author adjusted their work schedule to spend time with their girlfriend. She was already drinking when he got home, and during the drive to the restaurant, she brought more beer. At the restaurant, she got very drunk, leading to issues at the show. The author tried to handle it by waiting in the car, but she blamed him when they fought, and now she wants him to move out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but I need to assess both sides. \n\nThe author planned a special, expensive date. They tried to accommodate her by driving her, even after she was drinking. They asked her if drinking was a good idea, and she said it was fine. When she became too drunk to attend the show, the author made a decision to leave instead of sitting alone. The fight happened later when she accused him of ruining the date.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions involved excessive drinking that ruined the plans, and she blamed the author. The author's frustration is understandable given the effort and cost. He didn't force her to drink; she chose to, despite his concerns. His response was to leave the show, which was his choice to avoid an awkward situation. The blow-up happened when she accused him, and his sarcastic remark was in response to her blaming him. \n\nConsidering all that, the author seems to have done what he could to make the date work. The main issue was her drinking, which was her choice. The author isn't at fault here. So the answer should be B.\n"
