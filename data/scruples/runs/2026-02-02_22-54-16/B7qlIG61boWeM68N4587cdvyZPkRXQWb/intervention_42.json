Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is a big fight with his girlfriend after a Valentine's Day date that went south because she got very drunk. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author planned a special date for Valentine's, rearranged work to have time off. The girlfriend was at the bar with friends when he was leaving work. He arrives home, she's tipsy, and he's annoyed because she tends to get wasted once she starts. They head to an expensive restaurant, she brings more beer, drinks more, slurs words. Then she orders two more cocktails at the restaurant. They go to a show, but she's too drunk, passes out, and he leaves. They fight on the way home, she blames him, and ends up kicking him out.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author tried to plan a nice date, but the girlfriend's drinking interfered. He asked her a couple times if drinking was a good idea, and she said it was fine. Even though he was annoyed, he didn't stop her from drinking. When she got too drunk and they had to cut the date short, he left the show alone. The fight happened later, and she blames him.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he tried to accommodate her, but she didn't listen to his concerns. He had to deal with her drinking despite his warnings. His frustration is understandable, especially after spending money and time. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions might be seen as self-centered. She ignored his concerns, overindulged, and then blamed him for the ruined date. That's a red flag in a relationship. The author's actions\u2014leaving the show when she was too drunk to attend, not forcing her to go, and trying to handle the situation as best as he could\u2014might be justified. \n\nBut maybe there's a point where he could have intervened more. Did he do enough to prevent her from drinking? He asked a couple times, but maybe he should have been firmer. However, if she insisted, he might not have had the right to stop her. Also, leaving the show without checking in more with her could be seen as abandoning her, but he didn't want to sit alone at an expensive event. \n\nThe aftermath: he was angry and sarcastic, which he admits he's not the type to be. She blames him and kicks him out. The user wonders if he's the asshole. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend's actions directly caused the date to fail. She didn't respect his plans and her drinking led to their inability to enjoy the show. The author tried to manage the situation but was within his rights to be upset. His sarcastic comment about wasting money and time is a reaction to her behavior, which might be harsh but not entirely unfounded. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
