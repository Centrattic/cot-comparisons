Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got too drunk.\n\nFirst, the author planned the day off work to spend time with her. She was already drinking before they left, and then more in the car. The author tried to handle it, but she ended up slurring her words at the restaurant. Then she ordered more drinks there and got really drunk. \n\nAt the show, she passed out, and the author left because he didn't want to sit alone. She later accused him of not waiting, but he said she never told him that. They fought, he was angry about the wasted money and time, and she kicked him out. Now she's saying he should move out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. The author planned a special day and tried to accommodate her drinking, even though he was concerned. He gave her chances to sober up, asked if it was a good idea, and tried to be understanding. When she got too drunk, he had to leave an expensive show alone because she couldn't attend. He expressed his frustration, which led to an argument. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend made choices that ruined the plans. She drank despite warnings, got too intoxicated, and then blamed him. She also kicked him out and wants him to move out, which seems extreme. \n\nThe key points are whether the author was responsible for her drinking. He asked if it was okay, and she insisted. He isn't the one making her drink; she made her own choices. However, he did try to manage the situation as best as he could. His frustration about the money and time is valid because they spent a lot on plans that she messed up. \n\nBut was he wrong to leave the show? Maybe he could have tried to stay longer, but the show was expensive, and sitting alone might not be worth it. Also, when he got home and blew up, maybe he could have handled it more calmly, but he was clearly upset. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014kicking him out and wanting him to move out\u2014seems harsh, especially after she was the one who caused the problem. The author tried to be patient and even went to the show alone initially, showing he tried to make things work. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He made reasonable attempts to handle her behavior, and her actions were the main issue. His frustration is understandable given the effort he put into the date and the wasted resources. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
