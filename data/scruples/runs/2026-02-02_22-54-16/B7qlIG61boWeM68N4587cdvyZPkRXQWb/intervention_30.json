Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The author planned a special Valentine's Day date after adjusting his work schedule. His girlfriend was already tipsy when he got home, drank more on the way to the restaurant, and ended up slurring her words. Despite that, he tried to keep the date going, even after she was clearly impaired. At the show, she passed out and he left, which she blamed him for later. \n\nFirst, the author tried to accommodate her by adjusting his work schedule. He asked her if it was okay for her to drink more, and she said it was fine. However, she continued to drink, leading to her being unable to enjoy the show. The author then made a decision to leave because he didn't want to sit alone in a VIP section. \n\nHe was frustrated and upset about the wasted money and time, which led to an argument. She blamed him, called him out for ruining the date, and he expressed his frustration sarcastically. She later kicked him out and wants him to move out. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a reasonable expectation that she would attend the show? He tried to wake her up, gave her time to nap, but she refused. Leaving the show was a choice to avoid sitting alone, which is understandable. His frustration about the wasted money ($340) is valid, but his sarcastic comment might have escalated things. However, he wasn't the one who got drunk and caused the situation. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions led to the date being cut short. The author's reaction, while emotional, was in response to her behavior. He didn't force her to drink, and he tried to be accommodating. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
