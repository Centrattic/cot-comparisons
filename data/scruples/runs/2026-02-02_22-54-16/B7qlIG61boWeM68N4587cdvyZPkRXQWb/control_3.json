Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special day, moved his work schedule around, and had a nice restaurant and show planned. The girlfriend went to a bar with friends beforehand, then continued drinking during the trip to the restaurant and at the restaurant itself. The author tried to warn her about the alcohol, but she insisted it was fine. Then she got too drunk to attend the show, and the author left. They had a big fight, and she's now asking him to move out.\n\nSo, who's to blame here? The author did make efforts to plan a nice date. He tried to communicate his concerns about her drinking. She didn't listen and kept drinking despite his warnings. The author felt it was unfair to waste money and time on a plan that couldn't proceed because of her actions. When she was too drunk to go to the show, he left, which he thought was necessary because he didn't want to sit alone. She, on the other hand, blamed him for ruining the date, even though she was the one who got drunk. The author's frustration is understandable, especially with the financial and time investment.\n\nBut wait, did the author do anything wrong? Maybe he should have been more strict about her not drinking. But he did ask her a couple of times, and she reassured him. He also made the decision to leave when the situation was out of his control. He didn't force her to drink; she chose to continue. The fight seems to stem from her actions and her blaming him. So the author might not be in the wrong here. The key points are her responsibility in her own actions and his attempts to handle the situation as best as he could. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
