Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Valentine's Day date gone wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk. The author planned a special day, moved his work schedule, and spent a lot of money. The girlfriend drank beer and cocktails, ended up slurring her words, and couldn't attend the show. The author left the show because he didn't want to be alone, which led to a fight.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's actions: she drank alcohol despite the author's concerns, even after he asked her multiple times if it was a good idea. She continued drinking in the car and at the restaurant. Her behavior led to them not being able to enjoy the show. She also blamed the author for ruining the date and even suggested he move out. \n\nOn the other side, the author seems to have handled it by trying to accommodate her, even though he was annoyed. He went along with the plan, didn't confront her until she was already drunk, and then left the show to avoid being alone. But when he got home, he was angry and sarcastic, which probably escalated the situation. \n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The girlfriend was aware of the plans and continued drinking despite knowing the consequences. However, the author could have set clearer boundaries earlier. For example, maybe he should have refused to let her bring more drinks or insisted she stops drinking before leaving. Instead, he let her continue, which might have led to the situation. \n\nBut when she got there, he did try to handle it by letting her nap, but when she refused, he left. That decision might be seen as reasonable since he didn't want to sit alone with the expensive ticket. However, his reaction of yelling and sarcastically blaming her might have been harsh, especially after she was already drunk. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. He planned a nice date, tried to make it work, but when things went south, he expressed his frustration. But his girlfriend's actions were the main cause. However, his response could have been more constructive. Maybe he shouldn't have left the show without her, but he had paid for it and didn't want to sit alone. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend's choices led to the issues. The author might feel wronged because he handled things patiently, but his reaction could have been better. However, he's not entirely at fault. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the main fault lies with the girlfriend's drinking despite warnings. The author tried to accommodate her and only acted when she was already drunk and uncooperative. His anger stems from her actions, not his.\n"
