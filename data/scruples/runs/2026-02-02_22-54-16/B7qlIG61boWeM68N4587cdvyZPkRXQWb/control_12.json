Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fight between a couple after a Valentine's Day date gone wrong.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special day, rearranged his work schedule to spend time with his girlfriend. She was at the bar with friends before they met up. He noticed she was tipsy and worried because they had a nice dinner and a show planned. She continued drinking during the drive and at the restaurant, leading to her being very drunk. The show part was a problem because she passed out and he left without her. They had a big fight, she blames him, and now she wants him to move out.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and responsibility. Did the author set clear boundaries beforehand about drinking? He mentioned she was already drinking when he got home and brought more beer in the car. He asked her a couple times if it was a good idea. But maybe he didn't enforce his concerns. When she started slurring and got more drunk, he still tried to go through with the plans, even though it was causing issues. \n\nAt the show, he left because he didn't want to sit alone. That's understandable, but maybe he should have handled it differently. Did he try to talk to her about her drinking before it escalated? The fight that followed had him being sarcastic and angry, which might have contributed to the breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, she was responsible for her own actions. If she knew she wouldn't handle drinks well, maybe she shouldn't have overindulged. But the author also didn't stop her when he saw signs she was getting too drunk. There's a balance here between personal responsibility and mutual communication.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. He might not be entirely at fault, but he could have done things differently. Maybe he should have been more direct about his concerns about her drinking, or set boundaries earlier. However, she did make the choice to drink despite knowing the plans. The fact that he left the show alone was a reaction to her not showing up, but the fight over a conversation that didn't happen adds to the tension. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong entirely because he had a reasonable expectation for a functioning date after planning the event. But he might have failed to communicate his concerns clearly and manage the situation before it escalated. However, the main issue seems to stem from her actions and his reaction. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he was trying to accommodate her while she was getting too drunk, leading to the breakdown of the date. But there's room for both sides. Given the details, the author tried to manage the situation but couldn't control her behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
