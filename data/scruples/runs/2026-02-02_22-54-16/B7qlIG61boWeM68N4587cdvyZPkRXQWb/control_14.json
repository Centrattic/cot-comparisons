Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk. The author planned a special day, including a fancy restaurant and a show. The girlfriend was already tipsy when she left the bar, then drank more on the way and at the restaurant. During the show, she passed out, and the author left because he didn't want to sit alone. They ended up fighting, and she wants him to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author seems to have put effort into planning the date, adjusting his work schedule. He was concerned about her drinking and warned her, but she kept drinking. He tried to accommodate her by letting her sleep in the car, but when she was still unresponsive, he decided to leave the event. He got angry because she blamed him for ruining the date and wasted money. The girlfriend, on the other hand, got drunk despite his concerns, didn't attend the show, and then kicked him out after the fight.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author asked her multiple times if drinking was a good idea, and she said it was fine. So from a legal standpoint, she made her own choices. However, in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual respect and consideration. The author might feel wronged because he tried to be accommodating, but she disregarded his efforts. However, he also left the show without waiting for her, which could be seen as abandoning her when she was in a vulnerable state. But in the scenario, he mentions that she was passed out and wouldn't respond, so maybe he didn't have a choice.\n\nThe fight ended with her kicking him out and suggesting moving out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. His frustration is understandable given the effort and money spent, but he did leave the event, which might not have been the best decision. However, the girlfriend's excessive drinking and blaming him for the outcome seems like a bigger issue here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author could have set firmer boundaries earlier, and she could have respected his efforts by not overindulging. But the main question is if he's the asshole. His actions were a reaction to her behavior, and he tried to handle it by leaving the event instead of making the situation worse. The key here is whether his response was reasonable. Since he tried to reason with her and she was unresponsive, leaving might have been necessary. However, the argument and his sarcasm could be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a reaction to her actions.\n\nOverall, the girlfriend's responsibility for her own actions and blaming him seems more significant. The author tried to accommodate her, and while he left the show, it's in a situation where she was unresponsive. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
