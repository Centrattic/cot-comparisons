Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the couple planned a special Valentine's Day date. The author adjusted his work schedule to spend the day with his girlfriend. She went to the bar with friends while he was at work. When he arrived home, she was tipsy. He was annoyed because she tends to get wasted when she starts drinking, and they had a nice dinner planned. \n\nShe continued drinking beer in the car on the way to the restaurant. At the restaurant, she ordered more cocktails and got very drunk. The author tried to act normal despite her condition. Then they went to a show, but she was too drunk and eventually passed out. He left the show alone because he didn't want to sit there without her. She accused him of leaving without her, leading to a fight. She blamed him for ruining the date, and he felt angry and sarcastic. She then kicked him out and wants him to move out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nThe author tried to accommodate her by changing his work schedule. She went to the bar before they left, got more drinks in the car, and continued drinking at the restaurant. He asked her if it was a good idea, and she insisted it was. At the show, she was too drunk to participate, and he left. He felt it wasn't worth going alone. The fight happened when she blamed him for leaving, even though he didn't promise to wait. \n\nIs the author to blame for her getting drunk? Well, he asked her if it was a good idea, and she said it was. So he might not be directly responsible for her choices. However, maybe he could have intervened more. But she was an adult making her own decisions. \n\nWhen she passed out, he gave her time to nap but left when she didn't show up. He paid for expensive tickets and didn't want to sit alone. Is leaving reasonable? That's debatable. Maybe he should have tried to stay or find another solution, but he felt it was a waste of money and time. \n\nThe fight escalated when he was sarcastic about the costs. Maybe that was harsh, but he was upset. She blamed him, and he kicked out of bed. She then wants him to move out. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The girlfriend's actions led to the wasted plans, but the author's reaction might have been too harsh. However, he tried to handle it calmly but was furious in the end. The key points are whether he's responsible for her drinking and his actions. Since he asked her and she insisted, he might not be in the wrong. His decision to leave the show was his own choice, but given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), because he tried to accommodate her, she made her own choices, and his actions were in response to her behavior. However, there's some gray area, but the main responsibility lies with her actions.\n"
