Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Valentine's Day date gone wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to an argument and potential breakup.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special date, adjusting his work schedule to make it a nice experience. The girlfriend went to the bar before the date and drank more during the drive and at the restaurant. She became too intoxicated that they had to skip the show. The author left the show alone because he didn't want to sit by himself, and later they fought. The user is asking if the author is the asshole.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author did plan a special day, which shows effort. He tried to manage the situation when she was drinking, even asking her if it was a good idea. However, he left the show without her and didn't wait, which might be seen as abandoning her. Also, he sarcastically thanked her, which is harsh. On the other hand, she chose to drink excessively despite knowing the plans, which could be her fault.\n\nBut the key points are: Did the author have a responsibility to stop her drinking? He asked her a couple of times, so he tried. Then, when she was too drunk to attend the show, he left. Was that his fault? Maybe he should have waited or tried to find another solution. However, after she passed out and was unresponsive, leaving might have been reasonable. Also, he's the one who blew up, which could be his fault. The sarcastic comment about the money and time is definitely inconsiderate.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions led to the problems, but the author's reaction might be equally problematic. He didn't handle the situation calmly. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but the situation is complicated. However, some might argue he should have handled it better. But based on the details, the main issue is her drinking, so the author isn't the asshole.\n"
