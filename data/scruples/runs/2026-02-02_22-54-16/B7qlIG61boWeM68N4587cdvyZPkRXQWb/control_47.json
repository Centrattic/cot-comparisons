Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a Valentine's Day date that went bad because the girlfriend drank too much. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author rearranged his work schedule to have time off for the date. The girlfriend was already at a bar with friends when he was leaving work. He arrives home and finds her tipsy. He's annoyed because she tends to get wasted, and they had a special dinner planned. She brings more beer in the car, leading to slurred speech at the restaurant. The restaurant was expensive, and then she orders more cocktails. By the time they get to the show, she's passed out, and he ends up leaving the show alone. He's upset about the wasted money and time. They argue, she blames him, and she wants him to move out.\n\nSo, the key points: the girlfriend's alcohol consumption affected the date. The author tried to handle it by driving home and leaving the show. He got angry about the financial loss and the ruined plans. She was drunk and unresponsive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author planned the date, tried to accommodate her, but she ignored his concerns about drinking. He tried to wait for her to sober up but eventually left the show. He was angry about the wasted money and time. However, getting drunk and causing the date to be ruined could be her fault. But the author's response\u2014leaving the show and then blowing up at her\u2014might be seen as harsh. Did he handle it appropriately?\n\nOn one hand, she was the one who drank excessively despite his warnings. On the other hand, leaving her in the car and not going to the show could be seen as abandoning her. Also, his reaction of yelling and sarcastic remarks might have escalated the situation. She was already drunk, so maybe he should have been more patient. However, he did say he was furious about the money and time. Financial irresponsibility could be a valid concern.\n\nIs he in the wrong? It's possible he's not entirely wrong because she was the one who got drunk and ruined the plans. But maybe he could have handled it differently. However, the main responsibility for her actions lies with her. The author followed through with the plans as best as he could. So, perhaps the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any point where he misstepped. Leaving the show alone might be understandable if she couldn't join. His anger, while understandable, might make him seem harsh, but it's not necessarily wrong if she's responsible for her actions.\n"
