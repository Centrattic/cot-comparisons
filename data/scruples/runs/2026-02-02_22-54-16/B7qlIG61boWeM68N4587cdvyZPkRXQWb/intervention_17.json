Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is a fight between a couple after a Valentine's Day date gone wrong. The author (the guy) planned a special day, but his girlfriend got very drunk, leading to them not being able to enjoy the show and a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy rearranged his work schedule to spend time with her. She was already tipsy before they left, then drank more on the way to the restaurant. He tried to stop her, but she insisted it was fine. At the restaurant, she got slurred speech and ordered more drinks. The guy paid $340 for a fancy dinner and a show. She passed out, he left the show and drove home. She later accused him of ruining the date, and now wants him to move out.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The guy did his part by planning the date and trying to reason with her about drinking. He even waited in the car for her to nap. When she refused to attend the show, he made a decision to go home, which was reasonable since he didn't want to sit alone. The girlfriend's actions led to the cancellation of part of the date. However, maybe he could have handled it differently, like waiting longer or finding another solution. But considering the situation, he was trying to be understanding and even went along with her despite her drunkenness. The fight escalated when she blamed him for something he didn't do. So, the author's actions seem justified. The main fault lies with the girlfriend for getting overly drunk and not respecting the plans. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
