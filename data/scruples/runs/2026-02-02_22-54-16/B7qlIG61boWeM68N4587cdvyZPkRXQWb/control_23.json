Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. So, first, I need to understand the dynamics here.\n\nThe couple had a Valentine's Day date. The author rearranged his work schedule to be off so they could sleep in, which shows he put effort into making it special. His girlfriend was at a bar with friends before the date. He told her he was leaving work, and she came home. She was already tipsy. The author was concerned because once she gets drunk, it's hard to stop her, and they had a nice date planned.\n\nThey went to an expensive restaurant. She brought more beer, drank more in the car, and by the time they arrived, she was slurring. He paid $240 for the dinner. Then she ordered more cocktails at the restaurant, got very drunk, and struggled to stand. The author tried to keep the date going. Next, they were supposed to go to a $100 VIP show. She passed out in the car, didn't wake up, and he left because he didn't want to sit alone. She later accused him of leaving without waiting for her, even though he said that never happened. They fought, she blamed him, and now she wants him to move out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's analyze both sides.\n\nThe author tried to plan a special date, made sacrifices (changing work schedule), and tried to accommodate his girlfriend even when she was drinking. He asked if it was a good idea for her to drink more, and she insisted. At the restaurant, she drank more, leading to her being very drunk. Then at the show, she was too drunk to attend. The author left because he didn't want to sit alone. He ended up being angry, called her out for the waste of money and time, and she blamed him. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author tried to express concerns about her drinking before the date, but she ignored them. Once she was too drunk, he tried to make the best of it but had to leave the event. His frustration is understandable because he invested time and money. However, his reaction of sarcastically thanking her and being angry might have escalated the conflict. Also, she was clearly responsible for her own actions in overindulging. \n\nThe author isn't responsible for her decisions to drink excessively despite his warnings. He tried to manage the situation but couldn't control her choices. The fact that she later accused him of things he didn't say (like her telling him she'd follow after a nap) suggests she might have been in denial or defensive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation differently. Maybe he could have been stricter about her drinking, set boundaries earlier, or even left the event earlier with her to avoid the expense. However, given that she was insistent and the author tried to be accommodating, it's debatable whether he's in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the author seems to have done his part to plan the date and address her drinking. The main issue was her choice to drink despite his concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
