Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Valentine's Day date where the girlfriend gets very drunk, leading to the date being cut short and ending in an argument.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special day, moved their work schedule, and spent a lot of money on a fancy restaurant and a show. The girlfriend, however, drinks alcohol before and during the date, leading to her being too drunk to attend the show. The author feels wronged because they had to leave early, and the girlfriend blames them for ruining the date.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at both sides. The author did make an effort to plan a nice date. But when the girlfriend wanted to bring more beer, the author asked her if it was a good idea and she said it was fine. So maybe the author didn't stop her even though they were concerned. That could be a point against them. However, the girlfriend repeatedly drank despite knowing the plans, which seems irresponsible. \n\nThe author left the show alone because they didn't want to sit in VIP by themselves. That's understandable, but maybe they could have tried to be more understanding or suggested alternatives. On the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior led to the situation. She was drunk, passed out, and blamed the author. She also kicked him out and wants him to move out, which seems extreme.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility. The author did plan the date and tried to accommodate her, but the girlfriend's alcohol consumption was the main issue. The author might have been more proactive in stopping her from drinking, but since she insisted it was fine, maybe he's not entirely at fault. The girlfriend's reaction (calling him an asshole, wanting to move out) seems disproportionate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person who is in the wrong is typically the one whose actions caused the problem. Here, the girlfriend's excessive drinking and blaming the author are the main issues. The author tried to handle the situation as best as he could given the circumstances. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to be careful not to overlook if the author had a duty to prevent her from drinking. However, since she was an adult and he asked if it was okay, maybe he's not at fault.\n"
