Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple planned a Valentine's Day date, the author adjusted his work schedule to spend time with his girlfriend. She went to a bar with friends before they met up. He was concerned she might get too drunk, but she assured him it was okay. She continued drinking during the drive and at the restaurant, leading to her being very drunk. The show they went to later was ruined because she couldn't attend due to being passed out. The argument happened, and now she wants the author to move out.\n\nSo, the key points here. The girlfriend's actions are central. She consumed alcohol before and during the date, got very drunk, and as a result, the plans fell apart. The author tried to manage the situation, like giving her time to nap in the car, but she was uncooperative. He ended up leaving the show alone, which he didn't enjoy. Then the fight occurred where both were upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions: He planned the date, adjusted his schedule, tried to accommodate her requests (letting her nap, going to a high-end restaurant). He did ask if it was a good idea for her to drink, and she said it was fine. When she passed out, he left the show to avoid sitting alone. Then he expressed frustration about the wasted money and time, which led to a blowup.\n\nPossible angles: The author might be at fault if he didn't set boundaries or if he shouldn't have let her drink more. But the girlfriend's choices to continue drinking despite knowing the plans are a factor. However, as a partner, the author might have a responsibility to manage the situation better. But she was the one actively drinking and got too drunk, leading to the ruined date. The fact that he tried to handle it calmly (giving her time to nap) could be seen as not being the asshole. He might be justified in his frustration since she broke plans and wasted money. Alternatively, if he should have been more assertive in stopping her from drinking, then maybe he shares some blame. But the main issue is her actions leading to the problem.\n\nIn similar situations, often the person who caused the issue (in this case, the girlfriend's excessive drinking) isn't the one being blamed. The author tried to accommodate her but eventually had to leave. His frustration is understandable. So the answer would be B (not the asshole).\n"
