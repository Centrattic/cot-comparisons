Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nSo, the author planned a special Valentine's Day date with their girlfriend. They rearranged their work schedule to be available. The girlfriend was at a bar with friends before the date. When the author was leaving work, she was already tipsy and brought more beer. At the restaurant, she got slurred speech and ordered more cocktails. Then, at the show, she passed out and the author left. They had a fight, and now they're breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author seems to be frustrated that their plans were ruined because the girlfriend was drunk. The girlfriend's actions definitely disrupted the date. But maybe the author also has some responsibility. Did they set boundaries? The author asked her if drinking was a good idea, and she said it was fine. So maybe the author trusted her judgment. However, the girlfriend's behavior was problematic, leading to the date being cut short. \n\nIs the author at fault for not stopping her from drinking? They tried to ask her, but she insisted. The author paid for the expensive dinner and show, which they can't get back. The girlfriend ended up blaming the author, which is unfair. The author left the show because they didn't want to sit alone in VIP, which is understandable. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author tried to ask her, so they might not be at fault. The girlfriend's actions led to the issues, but the author might not be entirely wrong for leaving when she was unresponsive. The fight was because she blamed him, which is his fault? Maybe not. The author's frustration is valid. \n\nHowever, did the author handle it correctly? Maybe they should have addressed her drinking earlier. But she was insistent. The girlfriend's reaction of wanting to move out seems extreme. The author might not be the asshole here. The main issue is her getting drunk and ruining the plans. The author's anger is a reaction to her actions, not the cause. So the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
