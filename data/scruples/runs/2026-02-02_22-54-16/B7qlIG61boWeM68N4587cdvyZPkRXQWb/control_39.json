Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: It's Valentine's Day, and the author planned a special day to celebrate with his girlfriend. He adjusted his work schedule to spend the day together. The girlfriend was at a bar with friends before the date. When he arrived home, she was tipsy. The author was annoyed because he had a nice dinner planned, but she kept drinking, including bringing beer in the car and more cocktails at the restaurant. By the time they got to the restaurant, she was slurring. Then at the show, she passed out and he left without her. They had a big fight afterward, and she wants him to move out.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author planned a special day with money involved\u2014$240 for dinner and $100 for VIP tickets. He tried to manage the situation, even though he was annoyed. He asked her if drinking was a good idea, and she said it was fine. He went along with it, hoping she'd sober up. But she continued to drink and ended up too drunk to enjoy the show. He left the show because he didn't want to sit alone. Then she blamed him and wanted him to move out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: He made an effort to plan a special day, adjusted his work, tried to accommodate her, asked if she was okay with the drinks, and even stayed despite her getting drunk. The problem was her choice to keep drinking despite his concerns. He left the show because she wasn't there, and he didn't want to waste the VIP ticket. His frustration led to an argument where he expressed his anger about the wasted money and time. But he did act to accommodate her until she made it impossible.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side: She went to the bar with friends before the date, got tipsy, brought more drinks in the car, continued drinking at the restaurant, and then passed out. She blamed him for leaving the show, which he didn't do\u2014she was asleep. She was the one who was too drunk to participate in the activities they had planned. Her reaction of wanting him to move out seems harsh, especially since she was the one who caused the problem by over-drinking.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: The author tried to communicate his concerns, but she didn't listen. He had the right to be upset about the financial and time investment. However, his response of yelling and sarcasm might have exacerbated the situation. But given her behavior, his frustration is understandable. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether her actions were entirely her fault and if he handled it appropriately.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because he tried to accommodate her and only acted out when she ignored his concerns and made the situation unmanageable. The main issue was her over-drinking, which he couldn't control once she insisted on continuing. So, the answer is B.\n"
