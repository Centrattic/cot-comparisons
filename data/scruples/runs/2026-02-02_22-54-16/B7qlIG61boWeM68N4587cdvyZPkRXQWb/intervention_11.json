Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. They provided a detailed story about a Valentine's Day date that went wrong because the girlfriend got very drunk, leading to a fight and possible breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a special day, adjusted his work schedule to spend time with his girlfriend. She met friends at a bar, came home tipsy, continued drinking on the way to the restaurant, got slurred speech, ordered more cocktails, then passed out during the show. The author left the show alone, got into an argument, and she wants him to move out.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's look at the girlfriend's actions. She drank excessively despite the author's concerns. She was aware of the plans but still chose to get drunk, leading to them missing the show. The author tried to accommodate her by moving his schedule, but she didn't consider the financial cost or the effort he put in. The fight started when she blamed him for ruining the date, even though he was trying to salvage it by going to the show alone. The author's frustration is understandable because he invested time and money into the date, which was ruined by her actions.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have set firmer boundaries earlier. He asked her multiple times if drinking was a good idea, and she insisted it was fine. But once she started getting too drunk, maybe he could have handled it differently instead of leaving the show. However, the show was VIP and sold out; sitting alone there might have been uncomfortable. Also, she accuses him without merit, leading to the argument. The author's anger is justified if she's not taking responsibility.\n\nBut maybe the author could have tried to talk to her more calmly instead of blowing up, even if he was angry. However, considering the circumstances, his outburst might be a result of her persistent behavior. The key is whether he's at fault for leaving the show or getting angry. Since she was the one who got drunk and didn't listen to his concerns, he's not the one causing the problem. The girlfriend's actions directly led to the issues. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
