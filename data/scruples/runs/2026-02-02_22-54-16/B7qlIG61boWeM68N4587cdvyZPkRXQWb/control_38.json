Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the story provided.\n\nFirst, the context is a Valentine's Day date that went bad because the girlfriend got too drunk. The author planned a nice evening, including a fancy restaurant and a show. The girlfriend started drinking before they left, then more during the car ride and at the restaurant. By the time they got to the show, she was too drunk and ended up passing out. The author left the show alone and then they had a big fight.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The author tried to accommodate the girlfriend by adjusting his work schedule. He made sure they had time to sleep in, which is a nice gesture. He also tried to handle her drinking by asking her if it was a good idea multiple times. When she insisted, he went along, possibly because he wanted to make the date work despite her choices.\n\nBut here's the thing: he paid for a $340 experience, both for the restaurant and the show. The girlfriend's actions led to not being able to use the show tickets properly. The author was upset because his plans were ruined, and he expressed frustration. However, he did try to be understanding, like letting her nap in the car and waiting for her. When she got angry and blamed him, he lashed out, which might have been unfair.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't force her to drink. He asked if it was okay for her to drink more. She chose to get drunk, which led to the situation. However, in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual consideration. The author did make an effort to accommodate her, but when her actions ruined the plans, he reacted strongly. But he also tried to go along with her despite the issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior was problematic. She disregarded the plans, got too drunk, and then blamed him. The author's frustration is understandable, but his response (yelling, sarcastic remarks) might have been too harsh. However, it's also clear that the girlfriend's actions were the main cause of the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the main responsibility lies with the girlfriend for not respecting the plans and getting too drunk. The author's reaction, while perhaps a bit harsh, was in response to her actions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
