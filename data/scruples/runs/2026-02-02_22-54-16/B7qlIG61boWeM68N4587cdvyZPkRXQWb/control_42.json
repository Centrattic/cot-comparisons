Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Valentine's Day date that went south because the girlfriend got really drunk. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, let me recap the key points. The author rearranged his work schedule to spend the day with his girlfriend. They had a nice dinner at an expensive restaurant, then were supposed to go to a show. The girlfriend drank a lot before and during the date, leading to her being too drunk to attend the show. The author left the show alone, which upset her later, and they ended up in a big fight. Now the girlfriend wants him to move out.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author did something wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend got herself very drunk despite the author's concerns. She ignored his warnings, brought more beer, and ended up slurring words at the restaurant. Then she couldn't handle the show, napped in the car, and blamed the author when he left. She also accused him of ruining the date and kicked him out. That seems like she's responsible for her actions. The author tried to accommodate her by changing his schedule, planning a special date, and even went to the show alone despite the tickets being a waste. \n\nBut wait, did the author do anything wrong? The girlfriend chose to drink, but maybe the author could have set boundaries. For example, maybe he should have been stricter about not allowing her to bring more drinks or not letting her drive. However, he did ask her a couple times if it was okay, and she insisted. The author also didn't push back more, which might be a point. Also, when she was passed out in the car, he gave her time to sleep, which seems reasonable. When she blamed him for leaving the show, he was angry and sarcastic, which could be seen as harsh, but he had a reason to be upset because of the money and time spent. \n\nAnother angle is communication. Did they discuss her drinking before the date? If the author knew she tends to get too drunk, maybe he should have talked to her beforehand. But the story doesn't mention that. The author tried to make it a special day, and she undermined that by drinking excessively. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction to being blamed seems extreme. She's the one who got drunk and caused the situation, yet she's blaming the author and now wants him to move out. That seems unfair. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author tried to make a nice date, accommodated her, and even handled the situation as best as he could. The girlfriend made choices that ruined the plans, then turned on him. The author's anger is understandable given the effort and money spent. He isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
