Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight between a couple on Valentine's Day. The author planned a special date, but his girlfriend got very drunk, leading to them not being able to enjoy the events they had planned. He ended up leaving the show and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author moved his work schedule to spend time with his girlfriend. She was already tipsy before they even left for the dinner and brought more drinks in the car. At the restaurant, she ordered more cocktails and got too drunk. Then at the show, she was passed out and he left, which upset her. She later blamed him and wants him to move out.\n\nNow, considering who is at fault here. The girlfriend's actions: she got very drunk despite knowing they had a special plan. She ignored his concerns about drinking, leading to the date being ruined. He tried to accommodate her by driving, adjusting work, but she didn't take responsibility. The author tried to go along with the date even when she was clearly not in a condition to enjoy it. He left the show because he didn't want to sit alone, which is understandable. The argument escalated where he expressed frustration about the wasted money and time, which seems justified given the effort he put in. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that he could have handled the situation differently, like being more supportive or not leaving the show. But she was the one who made choices that led to the date not happening as planned. He did warn her and tried to be accommodating. The fact that she blamed him entirely and wants him out might indicate her not taking responsibility. \n\nSo, the author's actions were reactive based on her choices. He didn't push her to drink; she did that on her own. He made an effort to make the day special, and she undermined that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B."
