Might be single tomorrow.\nSo last night we celebrated Valentine's Day. I moved my work schedule around so that I'd be off yesterday evening and today so we could sleep in together, which is a rare treat for us. \n\nWhile I was about to get off work around 3 pm, she was at the bar getting drinks with her friend. \n\nI tell her I'm leaving work and she heads home. I arrive and she's fairly tipsy. I'm a little annoyed because once she gets a buzz going it's usually hard to stop her from getting wasted, and I have a really nice date planned for us.\n\nBut whatever, we have an hour+ drive to the restaurant. Maybe she'll sober up. But no, she chooses to bring more beer with her and drinks more in the car. I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \n\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she's already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn't go to Chili's. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240. We're not rich so it was definitely supposed to be a special occasion. But instead she insists on ordering two more cocktails there and by the end of it she is struggling to stand up straight while leaving the restaurant. But for the sake of our date I act like everything's fine and go on like normal. \n\nNext up we have a burlesque/circus show to attend. (Paranormal Cirque in Saint Augustine FL for those curious). By the time we get there, she's passed out drink. I try to wake her, she tells me to fuck off. I give her 15 minutes to nap in the car, and again after trying to wake her she tells me to fuck off because she's drunk. I already paid $100 for VIP tickets to this thing, and we'd have our own little section. I didn't want to sit there by myself, so I just left and started to drive us home. I'll go to like a movie or dinner by myself, but a show like that just wouldn't be fun to go to alone, especially with an open VIP seat next to you in a sold out show. \n\nHalfway home she starts giving me shit about leaving because she \"told me\" that if I would just go in then she would follow me in shortly after she got a little more sleep. That conversation didn't happen at all. I started to give her shit about the whole situation and she kept blaming me for ruining our date and I blew up. I'm not the type to yell, but I was furious. I sarcastically thanked her for wasting $340 and my time and 3 hours of driving just for her to get so drunk she nearly fell out of the restaurant and we couldn't even attend the show we were looking forward to all week. She again blames me and passed back out. \n\nIt's currently 4 am and she just woke up and kicked me out of bed, and I didn't put up much of a fight. She just texted me while waiting this that she wants me to move out. \n\nI might do that, but first- am I the asshole? Should I just be okay with her getting so plastered that we have to end our date early? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is a big fight after a Valentine's Day date that went poorly because the girlfriend got very drunk. The author, who's the boyfriend, planned a special day, but she ended up drinking too much, causing them to miss a show and have a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The boyfriend adjusted his work schedule to spend time with her, which shows he put effort into the plans. They went to an expensive restaurant and a show, which were supposed to be special. The girlfriend was already tipsy when they started, drank more in the car and at the restaurant, then slurred her speech. At the show, she got so drunk she passed out, leading him to leave early. He got angry and sarcastic about the money and time wasted, which caused a fight. She's now asking him to move out.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility. Did the boyfriend do anything wrong? He asked her if it was a good idea for her to drink more, and she said it was. He didn't force her. He tried to accommodate her by letting her nap, but she was still too drunk. When she blamed him, he expressed his frustration, which some might see as justified given the circumstances. However, he also left her at the show, which could be seen as abandonment, but he argues it wasn't fun to go alone. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions led to the date being ruined. Not showing consideration for his plans and getting drunk to the point of missing the show could be her fault. The boyfriend's anger might be a reaction to her actions, but he did blow up and use sarcasm, which might have escalated things. But considering he was upset after spending a lot of money and time, and she wasn't respecting the plans, his reaction might be understandable.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide if the author is the asshole. Factors to consider: Did he have a right to be upset? Yes, she ruined the plans. But was he wrong in how he reacted? He left the show, which might be seen as abandoning her, but he tried to talk to her and she was unresponsive. His sarcastic comment about the money could be harsh, but given the circumstances, maybe it's a result of frustration. The girlfriend's actions were the main cause, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
