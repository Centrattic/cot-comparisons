It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter Sunday dress. \n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for profit. She's clear about her reasons: she's busy with her own projects, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and avoids one-time use items. She also mentions that kids don't appreciate the effort, leading to wasted work. These are her justifications for saying no.\n\nHer sister took it personally, called her selfish, and took the issue to Facebook. The sister felt entitled to the dress as a sibling. The author, however, set boundaries and offered alternative solutions by suggesting shops. She also mentioned her sister's past choices not to learn sewing, implying responsibility.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics, there's a balance between personal boundaries and expectations. The author isn't obligated to sew for others, especially when it's a hobby. She communicated her stance respectfully and provided alternatives. The sister's reaction seems more about feeling slighted than a genuine need. The niece's age is 9, so the dress is a one-time use, which aligns with the author's dislike for such projects.\n\nThe key points are: the author had the right to say no, communicated her reasons, and offered help. The sister overstepped by public shaming and using the child's reaction to guilt-trip. The author isn't at fault for maintaining her boundaries. So, the answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
