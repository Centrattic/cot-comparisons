It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece, and her sister getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author sews as a hobby and makes her own clothes. She's clear that she doesn't sew for others because she finds it unenjoyable and not worth the effort, especially for one-time use. She also mentions that her sister didn't learn to sew from their mom, opting for other activities. The sister then publicly shamed her on Facebook, and the niece cried in a video, which made the author question her decision.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I should examine the boundaries of personal choice and family expectations. The author isn't obligated to use her hobby for others. She communicated her reasons respectfully\u2014busy with her own projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and valuing the work done for long-term use. The sister's reaction seems to stem from feeling slighted and possibly not respecting the author's hobby as a personal choice rather than a duty.\n\nThe sister's public shaming and the niece's emotional response might be more about the sister's feelings than the author's actions. The author did offer alternatives (suggesting shops), which shows she tried to accommodate without giving in to the request. The fact that the sister didn't learn sewing as a child is part of the author's explanation for why she can't just \"teach\" her now, implying that the sister isn't taking responsibility.\n\nIn terms of the \"AITA\" framework, people often weigh intent and impact. The author's intent was to be honest about her limitations, while the impact caused hurt feelings. However, the sister's actions in escalating the situation and public shaming might be the bigger issue here. The author isn't being selfish for not doing something she doesn't enjoy, especially when it's a hobby, not a service she offers.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She set clear boundaries and explained her reasons. The sister's public reaction is more about her own feelings and possibly not respecting the author's personal boundaries. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
