It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The situation involves the author sewing as a hobby and declining a request from her sister. \n\nFirst, the author made it clear she sews for herself and doesn't enjoy doing it for others. She had valid reasons: it's a hobby, she's busy with her own projects, and she doesn't like making one-time-use items. She also mentioned that sewing for kids is a waste because they might not care about the effort, which is a reasonable perspective.\n\nHer sister got angry, called her selfish, and took the issue to social media. The author's sister even had the niece cry on video, which seems manipulative. The author's response about suggesting shops and the sister's deflection about learning to sew herself (since they were given the same opportunity) adds another layer. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems exaggerated and possibly unfair. The author isn't obligated to use her time and skills for others unless it's a mutual agreement. The sister's framing of the situation as selfishness might be a way to deflect from her own expectations and the pressure she put on the author. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the Court of Public Opinion, the sister used the niece's emotions to gain sympathy, which isn't a healthy way to handle family disagreements. The author's reasons are personal and valid, and it's her right to set boundaries around her hobby. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her stance clearly and respectfully, and the sister's response was over the top. The author isn't obligated to do something that she's not comfortable with, especially when it's a hobby, not a service.\n"
