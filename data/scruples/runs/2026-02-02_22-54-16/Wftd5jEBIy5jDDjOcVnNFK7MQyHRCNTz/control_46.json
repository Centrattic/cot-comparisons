It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The situation involves the sister asking the author, who sews as a hobby, to make a dress for her daughter. The author declined, giving reasons like being busy with their own projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and disliking one-time-use items. The sister got angry, called them selfish, and took it to Facebook, which upset the author.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's position. They explicitly stated their reasons for declining: personal reasons related to their hobby and time management. They even offered alternatives by suggesting shops. The sister's reaction seems more about feeling entitled to a favor, possibly not respecting the author's boundaries. \n\nThe author's right to say no is important here. Everyone has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their time and creative efforts. The sister's response, including using the niece's video to guilt-trip, might be more about her own frustration and social pressure than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nThe author's statement about children not appreciating the work is a personal opinion, but it's not unethical to hold that view. They're not refusing out of malice but based on their own values. The sister's public shaming on Facebook and making the niece cry seems like an overreaction, indicating that the sister might be the one overstepping. \n\nThe key points are consent and respect. The author didn't force the sister to accept their reasons, but the sister's reaction was hostile. The author isn't in the wrong for declining a request that they were clear about. The sister's entitlement and the subsequent social media shaming are her issues, not the author's. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they set clear boundaries and the sister's reaction is the main issue here.\n"
