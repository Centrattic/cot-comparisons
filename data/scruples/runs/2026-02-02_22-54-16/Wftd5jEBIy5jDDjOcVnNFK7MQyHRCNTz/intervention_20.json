It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The situation involves the sister asking her to sew a dress, which the author declined for several reasons: she's busy with her own projects, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and finds one-time-use items like kids' dresses not worth her time. The sister reacted angrily, called her selfish, and took it to social media, which upset the author. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasons for declining are valid. She's making her own clothes as a hobby, not for money. She's clear about her boundaries and explains why she doesn't want to sew for others, especially for a child. The sister's reaction seems over-the-top, using emotional manipulation with the niece crying and taking it public on Facebook. The author tried to offer alternatives but was met with hostility. \n\nThe sister's argument that the author should help because she's a sister is a common one in family dynamics, but the author has every right to set her boundaries. The sister's public shaming and the niece's emotional appeal don't negate the author's right to say no. The author didn't force the sister to ask her; she could have approached others or bought a dress. The sister's framing of it as a feminist issue or a mother's burden seems like a stretch and adds unnecessary drama. \n\nThe author's response about the sister not learning to sew when given the chance is a bit harsh, but it's a valid point in the context of their conversation. The sister had choices but chose to pressure her. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own time and interests, especially when it's a personal hobby. The sister's actions and the backlash are more about her own expectations and handling of the situation rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
