It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The situation involves the author sewing as a hobby and declining a request from their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is clear that sewing is a personal hobby, not a job. They have a valid reason for not sewing for others: they don't enjoy it and prefer to work on their own projects. They also mention that they find sewing for children a waste because it's one-time use and the kids don't appreciate it. They tried to offer alternatives, like suggesting shops, but the sister was upset. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh\u2014calling the author selfish and bad. The author's sister took it to social media, which added more pressure. The niece even cried in a video. The author is feeling bad now after the backlash.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a rights-based perspective, the author has the right to decline requests that don't align with their interests, especially since sewing isn't their job. The sister's demands might be imposing on the author's time and personal choice. The author's reasons (not enjoying sewing for others, not wanting to make one-time use items) are personal but valid. They also offered alternatives, which shows consideration. The sister's reaction, however, seems extreme and possibly unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that being family should mean making sacrifices. But the author didn't force the sister to ask, and the sister's approach was demanding. The author's response about the sister not learning to sew herself also points to the sister's own choices. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, there's a common belief that family should help each other, but that shouldn't override personal boundaries. The author isn't refusing all family help, just this specific request. They have a consistent policy (refusing wedding dresses, etc.), which adds to the validity of their stance.\n\nThe sister's public shaming and the niece's emotional manipulation might be tactics to guilt-trip the author into compliance, which isn't fair. The author's feelings of being shamed are understandable, but the sister's approach seems more about getting her way than respecting the author's autonomy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for declining, communicated their stance, and offered alternatives. The sister's reaction is the issue here, not the author's decision.\n"
