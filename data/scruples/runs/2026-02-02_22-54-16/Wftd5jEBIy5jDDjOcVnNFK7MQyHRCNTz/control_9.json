It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author sews as a hobby and has been doing it for a long time, taught by their mom. Their sister asked them to sew an Easter dress for her daughter. The author declined, giving reasons like being busy with their own projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and disliking one-time use items. They also felt that sewing for kids is a waste since the kids don't appreciate it, and the mom just wants a photo. The sister got angry, called them selfish, and took it to social media. The author is now doubting themselves.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is not obligated to sew a dress for their niece. Sewing is their hobby, and they have the right to choose how to spend their time and energy. They provided alternatives, like suggesting shops, which shows they tried to help in another way. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially using social media to shame them and involving the child to make the author feel guilty. The author's reasoning about the value of their time and the one-time use of the dress is valid. People have different boundaries, and it's up to the author to set theirs.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family obligations require helping out, especially for special occasions like Easter. The sister might feel that since the author can sew, it's a natural request. However, the author clearly communicated their reasons and offered alternatives, so the sister's anger might be more about not getting her way rather than the author being inherently wrong. The sister's public shaming and guilt-tripping the niece are problematic tactics, which could indicate that the sister is the one overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to set boundaries, the sister's reaction being disproportionate, and the public shaming. The author isn't obligated to use their hobby for others' requests unless they choose to. The sister's behavior, including involving the niece and social media, is more concerning. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
