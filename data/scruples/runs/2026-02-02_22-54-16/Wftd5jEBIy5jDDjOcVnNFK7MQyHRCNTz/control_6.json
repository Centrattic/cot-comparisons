It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister (the author) refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece, leading to a conflict. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author sews as a hobby and makes her own clothes. Her sister asked her to make a dress for her daughter. The author declined, giving reasons like being busy, not liking to sew for others, and disliking one-time-use items. She also mentioned that kids don't appreciate the work and that it's just for a photo. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook where others criticized the author. The author now feels second-guessed.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Is the author obligated to help her sister in this way? Well, the author isn't being asked to donate money or give up something she owns; she's being asked to use her time and skills. Since sewing is a hobby she does for herself, it's her choice. However, family expectations can be tricky. The sister might feel entitled to the help because of family bonds.\n\nBut the author also has her own priorities. She's not a professional seamstress, so there's no expectation that she must provide sewing services. The refusal isn't about money but about time and personal preference. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially calling her selfish and involving public shaming. The niece's crying in a video adds emotional pressure, which might be manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that a family member should be willing to help in this way, especially for a special occasion. However, the author isn't in a position where she's obligated to do so. The key here is that the author is clear about her reasons and even offered alternatives (suggesting shops), but the sister dismissed those. \n\nThe author's reasoning about the dress being a one-time use and the effort not being appreciated is valid from her perspective. The sister's entitlement to the service and the public shaming could be the real issues here. The author didn't act out of selfishness in a negative sense but based on her personal values and time management.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. She isn't obligated to use her hobby to fulfill her sister's request, especially when she's clear about her reasons. The sister's reaction and public shaming are the problematic parts here.\n"
