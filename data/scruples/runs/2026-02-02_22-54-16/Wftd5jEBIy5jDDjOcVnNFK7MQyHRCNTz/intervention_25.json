It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making an Easter dress for her niece. The author sews as a hobby, not for profit, and has a history of turning down sewing requests. She politely declined, explaining she's busy with her own projects and doesn't like making one-time-use items. Her sister got upset, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook, leading to more backlash. The author feels second-guessed and is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's using her hobby for personal projects, which is her right. She's clear about her boundaries and reasons. The sister's request might be reasonable from her viewpoint, but the author isn't obligated to fulfill it. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially involving Facebook and the niece's emotional response. The author's response about suggesting alternatives and pointing out the sister didn't learn to sew might have been a bit harsh, but she had a right to set boundaries. The sister's use of the niece's emotions and public shaming could be manipulative. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author isn't wrong for refusing. People can have hobbies and personal time without feeling forced to share them. The sister's demands and the public shaming are problematic. The author's explanation about not wanting to sew for children and the waste of effort is a valid personal choice. While the sister might feel entitled due to familial relationships, the author isn't obligated to do something she's uncomfortable with. The key points are mutual respect and understanding each other's perspectives. The sister's approach was confrontational and possibly manipulative, which shifts the blame more towards her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
