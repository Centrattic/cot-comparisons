It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making an Easter dress for her niece. The situation involves family dynamics, personal boundaries, and differing expectations.\n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for profit. They've been doing it for a long time, taught by their mom. The sister asked them to make a dress for her daughter, but the author declined, citing being busy with their own projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and disliking one-time use items. The sister got angry, called the author selfish, and took it to social media. The author then felt bad and is questioning their decision.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The author has the right to set boundaries around their time and skills, especially as a hobby. They're not obligated to use their skills for others unless they choose to. However, family expectations can be tricky. The sister's reaction might stem from unmet expectations and a belief that family should help without expecting compensation. But the author isn't being selfish for prioritizing their own time and work, especially since it's a hobby, not a service they offer.\n\nThe sister's response of anger and public shaming is problematic. The author didn't force their help, and it's reasonable to decline. The sister's argument that she would help the author's kids if needed is a common tit-for-tat approach, but it's not necessarily fair if the author never asked for such help. The niece's crying and the sister's social media comments might be manipulative tactics to guilt-trip the author.\n\nThe crux is whether the author is wrong for not complying. The author's reasons are valid: personal time, dislike of sewing for others, and not wanting to invest effort for a one-time use. The sister's reaction seems more about perceived slights and not respecting the author's boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
