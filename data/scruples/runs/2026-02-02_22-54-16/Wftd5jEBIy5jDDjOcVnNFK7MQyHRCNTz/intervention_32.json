It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not making a dress for their niece on Easter.\n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for money. They were asked by their sister to make a dress for their niece. The author declined, explaining they're busy, don't enjoy sewing for others, and don't like one-time-use items. They also mention that kids don't appreciate the work and that it's for a photo, not worth their effort.\n\nThe sister got angry, called the author selfish, and took it to Facebook. The author suggested stores, but the sister was upset. The author also mentioned that the sister didn't learn to sew when they had the chance, unlike the author who learned from their mom. Then the niece cried in a video because the aunt wasn't making her a dress.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries. The author is setting limits on their hobby. They explained their reasons clearly. Sewing is their hobby, not an obligation. The sister's request was for a family event, but the author isn't required to help unless it's a prior agreement. The sister's reaction and social media post seem to be overreacting. The author didn't force anyone to take their suggestions. They stood by their decision.\n\nHowever, family dynamics can complicate things. The sister might feel the request was reasonable, especially as a family member. But the author isn't at fault for having their own priorities. The sister's public shaming and the niece's emotional response don't make the author wrong. The author isn't obligated to do something they're not comfortable with, especially when it's a hobby, not a job.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
