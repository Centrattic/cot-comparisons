It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The author sews as a hobby, not for work, and turned down her sister's request. The sister got angry and took it to social media, leading to public criticism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. She's clear that sewing is a personal hobby she does for herself. She explained her reasons: she's busy with her own projects, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and thinks one-time use items like Easter dresses aren't worth her time. She also mentions that children might not appreciate the effort, which is a valid point. Her response to the sister was firm but she tried to be gentle, offering alternatives like store-bought dresses. However, she ended up being harsh by telling the sister to buy a sewing machine herself, which might have escalated the conflict.\n\nOn the other side, the sister felt entitled to ask her sister for a favor, especially for her daughter's special event. The sister's reaction was harsh, calling her selfish and bad sister, which is unkind. But the sister might feel that family should support each other in such matters. The public shaming on Facebook and the niece crying could be seen as using emotional manipulation to pressure the author.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The key points are: the author set boundaries around her hobby, communicated her reasons, and didn't force herself to comply. However, the sister's reaction and the public shaming are problematic. The author's response of telling her sister to buy a sewing machine might have been unnecessarily harsh, but her refusal itself isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to say no to requests, especially when it's a personal hobby. The sister's entitlement and the subsequent emotional tactics are more questionable. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while family expectations can vary, it's not obligatory to use one's skills for others' requests unless it's a prior agreement. The author's reasons are valid, and she didn't owe the dress. The sister's reaction was more about shaming the author into compliance. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). She had the right to decline, and the sister's actions were more at fault.\n"
