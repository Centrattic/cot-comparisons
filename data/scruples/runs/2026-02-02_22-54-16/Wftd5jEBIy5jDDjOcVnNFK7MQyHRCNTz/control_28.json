It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the author, who sews as a hobby, should have made a dress for her niece for Easter. \n\nFirst, the author explains that sewing isn't her job, just a hobby. She's been doing it for a long time, but she doesn't enjoy sewing for others. She also mentions not wanting to do one-time-use items like a dress for a single event. The sister was upset and took it publicly on social media, which made the author question herself.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The sister wanted a special dress for her daughter, maybe seeing it as a way to create a meaningful memory or something the daughter would appreciate. The author, on the other hand, feels that her time and effort are better spent on her own projects and that the effort isn't worth it for a one-time use. She also points out that the sister didn't learn to sew from their mom, which might add to the frustration.\n\nThe sister's reaction seems harsh, calling the author selfish and bad, which could be an overreaction. The public shaming on Facebook might be a way for the sister to vent or gain support, but it's not fair to the author. The niece crying in a video could be manipulative, trying to guilt-trip the author.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation for the author to help. Morally, it's about personal choice and boundaries. The author set her boundaries clearly and offered alternatives, which the sister rejected. The sister's public shaming is more about her own feelings of rejection and maybe projecting her own insecurities. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own time and hobbies, especially when the request was outside her comfort zone and she provided other solutions.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
