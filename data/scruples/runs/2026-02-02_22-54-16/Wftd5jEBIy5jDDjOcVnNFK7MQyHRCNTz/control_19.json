It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who sews as a hobby, got asked by her sister to make an Easter dress for her niece. The author declined, explaining she's busy with her own projects, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and finds one-time use items for kids a waste. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook, where others were also critical. The author is now doubting herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's clear that sewing is a hobby, not a job. She's been taught by their mom and has declined similar requests before, like wedding dresses. Her reasons are valid: time constraints, personal preference, and the idea that kids might not care about the dress. She even suggested alternatives, which the sister rejected. The sister then took it public, which might be part of the issue here.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister felt entitled to ask her sister for a favor, especially for her child's special occasion. The sister's reaction might be over the top, but maybe she thought it was a simple request. However, the author isn't obligated to do this. The sister's public shaming and the niece crying could be seen as manipulative tactics.\n\nThe key points are whether the author had an obligation to fulfill the request. Since it's a hobby and not a commitment, the author isn't in the wrong for declining. She communicated her reasons and offered alternatives. The sister's anger and public shaming are her own issues. The author standing her ground by suggesting the sister learn to sew herself is also a valid response given the sister's past opportunities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her refusal is based on personal choice and valid reasons, and the sister's reaction is the problem here. The answer should be B.\n"
