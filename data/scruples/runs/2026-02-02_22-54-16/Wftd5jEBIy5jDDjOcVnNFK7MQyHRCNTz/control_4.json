It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The situation is about a sister asking the author, who sews as a hobby, to make a dress for her daughter. The author declined, explaining they're busy with their own projects, don't enjoy sewing for others, and don't like making one-time-use items. The sister got upset, accused the author of being selfish, and posted about it on social media, leading the author to doubt themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author makes clothes as a hobby, not for profit. They were asked to sew a special occasion dress for a niece. The author has a valid reason: they don't enjoy sewing for others, don't want to do one-off projects, and find it frustrating that kids can't appreciate the work. They also mention that the sister never learned to sew herself, so maybe there's some resentment there.\n\nThe sister reacted strongly, calling the author selfish and dragging it into social media. The niece even cried on video. The author is now questioning if they were wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. The author clearly communicated their reasons and offered alternatives. They didn't force the sister to take them up on their offer but instead suggested stores. The sister's reaction seems exaggerated, especially bringing it to Facebook and involving the niece to make the author look bad. The author's reasons for declining are personal and valid; they have the right to choose how they spend their time, especially as a hobby. \n\nThe sister's approach of shaming and public shaming is problematic. The author isn't obligated to fulfill the request, especially when it's not their responsibility. The fact that the sister didn't take the time to learn sewing herself adds another layer, but that's her choice. The author's frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't do anything unethical or hurtful beyond declining a request. The sister's reaction is more aggressive. Therefore, the answer should be B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
