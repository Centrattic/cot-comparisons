It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The situation involves family dynamics, personal boundaries, and differing expectations.\n\nFirst, the author sews as a hobby, not for income. She's been doing it for a long time, taught by their mom. Her sister asked her to make a dress, but the author declined, explaining she's busy with her own projects, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and finds it a waste for one-time use. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it public on social media, making the author feel bad.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and autonomy. The author is not obligated to sew for others, especially when it's a personal hobby. She communicated her refusal, even offering alternatives. The sister's reaction seems to stem from her own expectations and perhaps not respecting the author's time and preferences. The author's reasons\u2014personal time, not valuing one-time items, and not wanting to sew for kids\u2014are valid personal choices. \n\nHowever, family relationships can be sensitive. The sister's public shaming and the niece's reaction might indicate that the author's refusal caused hurt feelings. But does that make the author wrong? It's a balance between personal autonomy and family obligations. Since the author isn't being selfish out of malice but based on her own values, it's more about differing priorities. The sister's approach was confrontational and disrespectful, which could be the bigger issue here.\n\nThe answer would depend on cultural or family expectations, but in general, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
