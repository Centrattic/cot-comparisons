It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The situation is that the author sews as a hobby, not for work. Their sister asked them to make a dress for her child, but the author declined, explaining they're busy with their own projects, don't enjoy sewing for others, and dislike making one-time use items. The sister got upset, called them selfish, and took it to Facebook, where people criticized the author. The niece even cried in a video.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that their time is their own, and they shouldn't be forced to use their hobby for someone else's request. They also mention children not appreciating the effort, which is a bit of an excuse but maybe valid. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially bringing up the mom's role in teaching sewing. The author is clear that they offered alternatives, like shops, but the sister wasn't satisfied. \n\nI think the key points here are autonomy and expectations. The author isn't obligated to help unless they're being asked as a favor they agreed to. Since sewing is a hobby, not a service they offer, the author has the right to say no. The sister's public shaming and the niece's reaction seem over the top. People often project their own expectations onto others, expecting family to comply with their desires without considering personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. The sister's criticism about \"selfishness\" is subjective; the author is prioritizing their own time and interests. \n\nAlso, the sister had the opportunity to learn sewing herself but chose not to, according to the author. That's a valid point\u2014the sister can't expect others to do what she isn't willing to do. The situation seems more about the sister's need for validation and the author's right to say no. So, answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
