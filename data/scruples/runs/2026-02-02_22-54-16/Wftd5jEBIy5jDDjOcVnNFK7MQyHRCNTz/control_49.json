It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The sister asked them to sew a dress, and the author declined, explaining they're busy with their own projects, don't enjoy sewing for others, and find one-time use items like children's dresses not worth the effort. The sister got angry, called them selfish, and took it to Facebook where people criticized the author. The author is now doubting themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mentioned it's a hobby, not a job, and they don't sew for others. They also don't like making one-time use items because kids don't appreciate it. That's a valid perspective. People have the right to set boundaries around their hobbies, especially if they're not being compensated. It's their time and effort, and they can choose how to spend it.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister felt entitled to the dress because they're family and she's a mother. The niece was upset in a video, and the sister framed it as the author being selfish. However, the author offered alternative solutions like shops, which shows they were trying to help in another way. The sister's reaction of anger and public shaming might be more about her own feelings of being slighted than the niece's needs. The niece being a child might not even understand the situation, but the mother's actions are driving the conflict.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries, entitlement, and the emotional manipulation used by the sister. The author isn't obligated to provide their time and skills unless they choose to. The sister's public shaming and the niece's crying might be tactics to guilt-trip the author, which is unfair. The author's reasons for declining are personal and valid, and they have the right to say no without facing criticism for selfishness.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries and explained their reasoning. The sister's response was disproportionate and manipulative. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
