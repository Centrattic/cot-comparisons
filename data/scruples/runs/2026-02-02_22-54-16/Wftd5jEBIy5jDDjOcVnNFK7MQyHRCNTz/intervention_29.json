It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a sister who sews as a hobby and was asked to make an Easter dress for her niece. She said no because she doesn't enjoy sewing for others, finds one-time use items not worth the effort, and doesn't like sewing for kids. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it public on Facebook, making it seem like the author is being cruel.\n\nFirst, the author has every right to set boundaries. Just because you're a family member doesn't mean you have to help. Sewing is her hobby, not her job. She's not obligated to spend her time sewing for others, especially if it's something she doesn't enjoy. The sister's argument that it's a simple task (\"a few seams on some fabric\") is dismissive of the time and skill involved. \n\nThe sister also brought up the mother's teaching, implying the author should have passed on the skill. But the author's sister chose not to learn, so it's not the author's responsibility to make up for that. The niece's age and her likely not appreciating the effort is a valid point. Children outgrow clothes quickly, and the dress would only be used once, which the author sees as a waste. \n\nThe sister's reaction of anger and public shaming is more concerning. Using the niece to cry for attention is manipulative. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by her decision and explaining her reasons. People have different priorities and hobbies; it's not selfish to choose your own time for activities you enjoy. \n\nThe sister's insistence that the author should make the dress because it's for family is pushing boundaries. The author isn't being cruel by not complying, especially when she's clear about her reasons. The public backlash the author faced is more about the sister's frustration than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. She communicated her decision respectfully, offered alternatives, and didn't force herself to do something she's uncomfortable with. The sister's reaction is the issue here.\n"
