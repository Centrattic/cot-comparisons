It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making her niece an Easter dress. The sister got angry and took it to Facebook, saying the author is selfish. The author explains that sewing is a hobby, not a job, and she doesn't like sewing for others or one-time use items. The sister felt entitled to the dress, even though she didn't sew herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's clear that sewing is a personal hobby, not something she does professionally. She declined politely, giving reasons about being busy, not enjoying sewing for others, and the one-time use issue. Those are valid reasons. It's her own time and effort, and she's under no obligation to use it for others, especially for a child who might not even care about the dress. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially using the niece to get sympathy. The author's response about suggesting shops and the sister dismissing it as meaningless shows a lack of understanding from the sister's side. The sister also brought up the mother's role, implying guilt, which might be a manipulation tactic. The Facebook posts and the niece's crying video are examples of public shaming and emotional coercion.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other, but the author isn't avoiding helping entirely; she's offering alternatives. The sister's entitlement could be an issue here. The author isn't in a position where she has to sew the dress, especially if it's not her responsibility. The sister's reaction seems more about her own frustration and feeling slighted than the niece's actual need. The author's reasons are personal boundaries, which are important. She's not being selfish for prioritizing her own time and not doing something she doesn't want to do. The sister's approach was confrontational and public, which isn't healthy. The author's response about the sister not learning to sew was a bit sharp, but it was a defense of her own time and the mother's equal role in teaching sewing. Overall, the author isn't in the wrong because she's respecting her own limits and the sister is overstepping.\n"
