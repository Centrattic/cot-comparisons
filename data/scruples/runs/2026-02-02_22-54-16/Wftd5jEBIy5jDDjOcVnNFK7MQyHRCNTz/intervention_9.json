It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author sews as a hobby and makes her own clothes. Her sister asked her to make an Easter dress for her 9-year-old niece. The author said no, explaining she's busy with her own projects, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and finds one-time use items like kids' dresses a waste of time. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook. The author is now doubting herself and asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's reasons. She's clear about her boundaries: sewing is a hobby she does for herself, not for others. She's been approached before for things like wedding dresses and turned them down. That's a consistent boundary, which is important. She also mentions that kids won't appreciate the work, and it's for a photo. That's a valid concern\u2014maybe she feels the effort isn't worth the outcome. \n\nThen there's the sister's reaction. She got angry, claimed the author was selfish, and used the Facebook court to get support. The sister even had her daughter cry about it. The author feels bad about being criticized, but maybe she's right to stick to her boundaries. Family can sometimes push for things without considering personal limits. The sister might feel entitled because they're family, but that doesn't mean the author has to comply. \n\nThe author suggested alternatives, like stores for nice dresses, but the sister dismissed that. Maybe the sister wanted to save money or wanted a custom piece. However, the author isn't obligated to give her time or skills just because they're related. The sister's reaction seems harsh, using emotional manipulation with the niece's tears. That's a red flag. \n\nThe author's response to the sister's complaints\u2014telling her to buy her own sewing machine\u2014shows she's standing her ground. The sister's choice to not learn sewing when given the opportunity (since their mom taught them) is on her. So the author isn't wrong for pointing that out. \n\nSocial media shaming is a big part here. The sister used Facebook to get support, which can sway people's opinions. But the author's reasons are personal and valid. The sister's complaints about feminism and tomboy might be deflecting from the real issue. The niece's age is 9; maybe she's not into dresses, but that's the sister's responsibility to handle. \n\nIn terms of family dynamics, boundaries are important. It's okay to say no without guilt. The author isn't in the wrong for not doing something she doesn't want to do. The sister's entitlement and public shaming are the real issues here. The author's refusal isn't selfish; it's about respecting her own time and skills. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
