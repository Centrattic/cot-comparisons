It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to sew an Easter dress for a niece. The author sews as a hobby and doesn't enjoy sewing for others, especially for one-time use. The sister got angry and took it to Facebook, which made the author feel bad. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a valid hobby and use their time to create their own clothes. They clearly communicated their reasons for not making the dress: being busy, not enjoying sewing for others, and not valuing one-time-use items. They also offered alternatives like stores, which the sister rejected. The author's reasoning about children not appreciating the effort and the dress being for a photo makes sense to some extent.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister felt wronged and took it to social media, which might be an overreaction. However, family expectations can be different. Maybe the sister felt that a sibling should help out without expecting anything in return, especially for a child-related matter. The sister's argument that she would help if the roles were reversed might add to the perceived selfishness from the author's side.\n\nThe author's response about the sister not learning to sew because she preferred other activities is a bit harsh. It might come off as blaming the sister for not having the same skills. The niece crying in a video is emotional manipulation, which is unfair, but the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong just because of that.\n\nConsidering all sides, the author had the right to say no, especially since sewing isn't their job and they made their reasons clear. The sister's reaction was harsh, but the author's stance seems justified. So, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
