It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author declining to sew an Easter dress for their niece, which led to some conflict with their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author sews as a hobby, not for income. They were asked by their sister to make a dress for her daughter. The author refused, explaining they were busy, didn't enjoy sewing for others, and didn't like making one-time-use items. The sister got upset, called the author selfish, and took it to social media. The author now feels second-guessed and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nThe author's reasoning for saying no includes personal boundaries, time management, and valuing their hobby as personal time. They also mentioned that the sister had the opportunity to learn sewing but chose other activities. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially using the niece to cry and posting on Facebook, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author has the right to set boundaries, especially since sewing isn't their job. The sister's expectations might be unreasonable, expecting a free, custom-made dress from a hobbyist. The author didn't refuse out of spite but based on personal reasons. The sister's response, however, was aggressive and public, which is more problematic.\n\nHowever, family dynamics can be complex. Maybe there's a history of expectations or past favors. The author might have considered the sister's feelings more before declining, but they did offer alternative solutions (suggesting shops). The sister's use of the court of public opinion (Facebook) and involving the niece in the conflict might indicate she's the one overreacting.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The sister's reaction is more in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
