It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece. The author explains that sewing is a hobby, not a job, and she doesn't like making one-time use items, especially for kids. Her sister got angry and took it to Facebook, causing the author to feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear she's busy with her own projects and doesn't enjoy sewing for others. She's not obligated to help, right? Family expectations can vary, but everyone has the right to say no. The sister's reaction seems a bit harsh, especially using a child to get what she wants. That's manipulating the situation emotionally.\n\nThe author offered alternatives, like suggesting shops, which shows she tried to be helpful. The sister didn't take it well and spread negative comments online. The niece crying in a video might be an emotional tactic to pressure the aunt. That's underhanded. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about not wanting to do one-time use items makes sense. The dress is for a single event, and kids outgrow things quickly. The sister's insistence seems to prioritize her own desires (the Facebook photo) over the niece's actual needs. \n\nBut maybe some people would see the author as selfish for not helping family. However, the author isn't avoiding the request out of spite but based on personal boundaries. She's not the one being unreasonable here. The sister should respect her limits. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She had valid reasons and communicated them. The sister's response was inappropriate. Answer B.\n"
