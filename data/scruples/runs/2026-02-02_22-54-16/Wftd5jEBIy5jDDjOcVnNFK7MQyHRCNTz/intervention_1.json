It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sewing an Easter dress for her niece. The sister wanted her to make a dress for her 9-year-old daughter, but the author declined. She explained she's busy with her own projects, doesn't like sewing for others, and finds sewing for one-time occasions a waste. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook where the author was criticized.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for declining. She's clear that sewing is a hobby for herself, not a service she offers. The sister's argument is that she would do it for her own kids, implying the author should do the same. But the author isn't a parent, so maybe that's different. Also, the sister's daughter is not her responsibility. The author's time and effort are her own to manage. \n\nThe sister's reaction seems a bit extreme. She's using guilt-tripping tactics, like saying the author is a bad sister and taking it to social media. The niece crying in a video is manipulative. The author did offer alternatives, like suggesting stores, but the sister rejected that. \n\nEthically, people can choose how to spend their time and resources, especially on family matters. The author isn't obligated to sew for others unless it's a mutual agreement. The sister's expectation might stem from a cultural or family norm, but the author isn't required to comply if it's against her will. \n\nThe author's reasoning about one-time use and children's behavior isn't unreasonable. She values her hobby for personal satisfaction, not for others. The sister's criticism doesn't justify the author's refusal. Also, the sister didn't take responsibility for her own choices, like learning to sew or buying a dress. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She had valid reasons and tried to be polite. The sister's actions and the ensuing social media drama are more about her own expectations and emotional manipulation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
