It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author (the sister) is in the wrong for refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece. \n\nFirst, I need to outline the key points. The author sews as a hobby, not for income. She's been making her own clothes for years. Her sister asked her to make a dress for her 9-year-old daughter. The author declined, explaining she's busy with her own projects, doesn't like sewing for others, and finds it wasteful for children. The sister was upset, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook. The niece even cried, making the author feel bad.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid point about time and personal boundaries. Sewing for others, especially for a one-time event, can be time-consuming and not personally fulfilling. She's clear about her reasons and even offered alternatives by suggesting shops. However, the sister felt slighted, especially since the author's mom taught both of them to sew. The sister might feel that as an aunt, she should help. \n\nThe author's sister might perceive the refusal as a lack of support, especially if there's a cultural or family expectation to help with such events. The author's comment about the niece not appreciating the effort and the mention of the sister not learning to sew herself might have added insult, making the situation worse. The Facebook court's reaction could amplify the sister's side, making the author feel guilty.\n\nBut the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. Everyone has the right to say no to extra commitments, especially when it's a hobby. The sister's approach might be more at fault for not respecting those boundaries and using the niece's reaction to guilt-trip. The author's response about the sister not wanting to learn sewing might have crossed a line, but her primary refusal was reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. It's about personal choice and boundaries, and the sister should have accepted the refusal without escalating it.\n"
