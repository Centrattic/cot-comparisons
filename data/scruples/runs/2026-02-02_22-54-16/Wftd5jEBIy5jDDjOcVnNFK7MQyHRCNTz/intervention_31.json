It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The situation involves the author sewing as a hobby and declining a request from their sister. The sister got angry and took it to Facebook, causing some drama.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They mentioned that sewing is a hobby, not a job, and they use it to make their own clothes. They were approached to make a dress for their niece, but they declined because they don't enjoy sewing for others, find one-time-use items not worth the effort, and have their own projects. They also suggested alternatives like buying the dress. The sister felt betrayed and took it public, which upset the author.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that as a family member, the author should help without being asked, especially for a special occasion like Easter. The sister's argument is that she'd do the same for the author's kids, and she's upset that the author isn't willing to do it. The niece, being a child, might feel hurt if she wanted the dress and the aunt refused.\n\nBut the key points here are the author's boundaries. They clearly stated their reasons upfront, which is important. The sister's reaction seems harsh, especially dragging the issue to social media and making personal attacks. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but based on personal preferences and time constraints. The sister's expectation might not be realistic if she hasn't supported learning to sew herself, as the author pointed out.\n\nThe author suggested alternatives, which shows they were trying to be helpful without compromising their own values. The sister's reaction, including involving Facebook and making the niece cry, seems more about her own feelings of being slighted rather than the niece's needs. The author's main responsibility is to their own time and energy, and they have the right to say no without guilt.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their stance and offered solutions. The sister's overreaction is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
