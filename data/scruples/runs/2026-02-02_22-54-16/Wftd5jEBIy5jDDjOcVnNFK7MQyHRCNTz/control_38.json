It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their niece an Easter dress. The author sews as a hobby and makes their own clothes. The sister asked them to make a dress for their daughter, but they said no because they're busy, don't enjoy sewing for others, and dislike making one-time-use items. The sister got angry, called them selfish, and took it to Facebook. The author feels bad and is second-guessing themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They mentioned that sewing is a personal hobby, not a job. They also have their own projects to work on. It's their time and effort, so they have the right to choose how to spend it. The sister's request was for a child's dress that might not be reused, which the author finds frustrating. They also pointed out that the sister didn't learn to sew when given the chance, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister feels entitled to ask her sister for a favor, especially since it's for family. The niece is young and wants the dress, and the sister is upset that the author didn't help. But the author isn't obligated to do this. They clearly communicated their reasons, and the sister took it personally. The public shaming and making the niece cry seems like an overreaction from the sister's side.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author set their boundaries, and the sister disrespected them. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to spend their time on something they don't enjoy, especially when it's not part of their job. The sister's reaction and taking it to social media is problematic. The niece's reaction is also a tactic to guilt-trip the author, which isn't right either. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
