It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sewing a dress for her niece. The scenario involves the author declining a request from her sister to make an Easter dress, explaining that it's not worth her time and effort. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it public on Facebook. The author is now second-guessing herself.\n\nSo, first, I need to analyze the situation. The author sews as a hobby, not for profit. She's clear about her reasons: she's busy, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and doesn't like making one-time-use items. She also mentions that kids might not appreciate the effort. The sister felt slighted and took it to social media, which escalated the issue.\n\nThe author didn't force her opinion on the sister, but she was honest about her boundaries. The sister's reaction seems to be more about feeling disrespected or perhaps unappreciated. However, the author's reasoning is valid because personal time and hobbies should be respected, especially when they're not part of a business. The sister could have chosen to buy the dress or learn to sew herself, as the author suggested.\n\nThe sister's public shaming and involving the niece to cry about it adds emotional manipulation, which might be a tactic to guilt-trip the author. The author's refusal is a personal choice and not a moral failing. The sister's actions (public shaming) are questionable, but the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the author crossed a line. Here, the author was honest and respectful in her refusal, even offering alternatives. The sister's response was more over the line. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
