It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not making the niece an Easter dress. \n\nFirst, the author explains that sewing is a hobby they do for themselves. They don't make money from it and only make their own clothes. The sister asked them to make a dress for her daughter, which the author declined, giving reasons like being busy with their own projects, not enjoying sewing for others, and disliking one-time-use items. They also mentioned that kids don't appreciate the effort and that the mom wants it for a photo.\n\nThe sister got angry, called the author selfish, and took the issue to Facebook, where the sister painted the situation in a way that made people think the author was being cruel. The author felt bad but still stands by their decision. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's right to their hobby, the boundaries of family obligations, and the sister's reaction. The author isn't obligated to sew for others, especially since they don't enjoy it and it's not their source of income. They offered alternatives, which the sister rejected. The sister's reaction seems more about her own expectations and using social media to validate her side, which might be the real issue here. \n\nThe author didn't do anything that's a moral failing; they're being honest about their limitations. The sister's actions (public shaming, making the niece cry) are more problematic. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
