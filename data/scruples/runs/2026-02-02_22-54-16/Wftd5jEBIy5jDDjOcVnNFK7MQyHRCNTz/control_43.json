It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister refusing to sew an Easter dress for her niece.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author sews as a hobby, not for money, and has been doing it since her mom taught her. Her sister asked her to make a dress for her 9-year-old daughter, but the author declined. She gave reasons like being busy with her own projects, not liking to sew for others, and disliking one-time use items. She also thought it was a waste because kids wouldn't appreciate it. The sister was upset, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook, where others commented negatively. The niece even cried in a video.\n\nThe author is questioning if she's the asshole here. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has the right to choose how to use her free time and skills. She wasn't obligated to sew the dress, especially since it's a hobby, not a job. She explained her reasoning, suggested alternatives, and stood her ground when the sister didn't accept that. On the other hand, the sister might feel hurt that her sister refused, especially since the author was taught sewing by their mom. The sister might feel it's a family tradition or that the author is being selfish by not helping.\n\nBut the author didn't force her sister to ask. The sister approached her, and the author said no politely. The sister's reaction seems more about her own hurt feelings and needing validation. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. People have the right to say no, even to family requests. The sister's response, using Facebook and involving the niece, might be more about her own frustration than the author's actions.\n\nAdditionally, the author isn't being cruel; she's honest about her limits and offered alternatives. The sister's public shaming and the niece's tears seem like reactions to being denied, not necessarily the author's fault. The author isn't obligated to sacrifice her time and energy for something she doesn't want to do. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
