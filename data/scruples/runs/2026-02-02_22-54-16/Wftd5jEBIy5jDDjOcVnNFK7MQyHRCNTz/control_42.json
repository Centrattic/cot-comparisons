It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author, who sews as a hobby, refused to make an Easter dress for her niece. The sister got angry, called her selfish, and took it to Facebook. The author is now doubting herself.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: she's busy with her own projects, doesn't enjoy sewing for others, and dislikes making one-time-use items. She also mentions that kids don't appreciate the work, and it's just for a photo. These are valid personal boundaries. Sewing is her hobby, not an obligation.\n\nThen, the sister's reaction: anger, accusations of being selfish and a bad sister, and taking it public on social media. The sister also used the niece to cry about it, which adds emotional manipulation. The sister didn't consider the author's time or interests, treating a hobby as a service she's owed.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had an obligation. Since sewing isn't her job or something she agreed to do, she's not in the wrong for declining. The sister imposed her request without considering boundaries. The author even offered alternatives (shops), but the sister dismissed them, showing entitlement.\n\nThe public shaming and involving the niece in the drama are signs of the sister overreacting and using emotional tactics. The author's response about the sister's past opportunities to learn sewing is a bit harsh, but it's a defense of her stance. Overall, the author maintained her boundaries, which is okay. The sister's actions were more problematic.\n"
