My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his wife wants her mom to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The author is against it because he finds the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He explains that he's been respectful but can't handle living with her. He also mentions that they have a free room but plan to have another child, so space is an issue. The mother-in-law gets upset, saying assisted living is like prison and that family should take care of her. The author's wife isn't kind to his own mother either, which makes him more resolved.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's personal comfort, the potential strain on the marriage from the mother-in-law's presence, and the wife's lack of effort in her own family relationships. The author is standing by his decision, feeling it's necessary for his own well-being and the future of their family.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and might need support. On the other hand, the author has valid reasons for his refusal, citing the woman's difficult personality and the practicality of their living situation. The wife's behavior towards his mother also adds context, suggesting that the wife isn't helping in building family relationships, which might influence the author's stance.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, personal boundaries and mental health are important factors. The author isn't being cruel; he's setting a boundary for his home. The mother-in-law's feelings are hurt, but the author's decision isn't out of selfishness alone\u2014it's about managing a living situation that could become stressful. The fact that the wife isn't making an effort in her own family might also justify the author's resolve.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a difficult decision based on his circumstances and the dynamics of his relationship. So the answer should be B.\n"
