My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it. He mentions that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and he doesn't think he can handle living with her. He also points out that they have a free room but plan to have another child, so space might be an issue. The wife gets upset, comparing assisted living to prison and accusing the author of lacking compassion. The author also mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother, even refusing to stay with her and insisting on a hotel.\n\nNow, to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the author's reasons for not wanting the mother-in-law to move in versus the wife's perspective. The author's main argument is that the mother-in-law is difficult, and he wants to maintain his comfort in the home. The wife feels it's a compassionate thing to do and is upset when the author suggests assisted living. The author also uses a comparison to his wife's treatment of his mother, which might be a point about fairness.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, which can vary. In some cultures, adult children are expected to care for their aging parents, but in others, the spouse might have different expectations. The author is asserting his right to be comfortable in his own home. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that supporting her mother is a duty. The author's mention of planning another child could be a valid concern about space and resources.\n\nThere's also the issue of the wife's behavior towards the author's mother, which might indicate a pattern of prioritizing her own family over his. The author's resolve is stronger because of that, which could be seen as justified. However, the author's refusal might be seen as selfish if the mother-in-law genuinely needs support and there's a feasible arrangement.\n\nBut the author isn't refusing outright; he's considering alternatives like assisted living. The mother-in-law's reaction to that is negative, which complicates things. The author's stance is that he's not uncaring but can't handle the living arrangement. The question is whether his refusal is justified given his reasons, or if he's being selfish by not accommodating his wife's mother despite the challenges.\n\nIn many cases, these situations involve complex family dynamics and personal boundaries. The author isn't being cruel; he's stating his limits. The wife's perspective is about duty and compassion, but the author's about personal well-being and practicality. Since both sides have valid points, but the question is whether the author is wrong. Since he's not refusing care entirely but explaining his reasons and considering alternatives, it's likely he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
