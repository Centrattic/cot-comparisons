My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's main points are that he doesn't want his mother-in-law to move in because she's difficult and judgmental. He's worried about the impact on their home, especially since they're planning to have another child. He also mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother, which adds to his hesitation. The wife and mother-in-law seem to think he's being selfish, but he's standing by his decision based on his comfort and family planning.\n\nNow, I should consider common factors in such situations. Typically, when family members push for a relative to move in, it's about caregiving and companionship. But the author has valid reasons: the stress of living with his mother-in-law, potential strain on his marriage, and future family plans. His wife's lack of effort to improve her relationship with his mother might also affect how he feels about her demands.\n\nI need to check if the author's refusal is justified. If the mother-in-law is in her 70s and living alone, there's a concern about her well-being. However, the author is considering alternatives like assisted living, which shows he's not indifferent. The wife's negative behavior towards his mother complicates things, as it adds to the tension and may justify his reluctance.\n\nAnother angle: the author is standing his ground about his home being a safe space. If the mother-in-law's presence would cause him significant stress, it's reasonable for him to prioritize his mental health and family's needs. The wife's insistence without considering his perspective could be seen as selfish.\n\nHowever, there's a balance. The key is whether his refusal is inconsiderate. He did consider alternatives, so it's not just a refusal without trying. The wife's behavior towards his mother might make the author's stance more understandable. The user's initial thought is that the author is not in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that personal boundaries and family planning are valid reasons.\n\nI should also think about societal expectations. Sometimes, there's pressure to care for aging parents, but it's not always mandatory. The author isn't neglecting his mother-in-law; he's offering alternative solutions. His wife's judgmental attitude and the existing strained relationships play a role in his decision.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasons are personal and based on his comfort and family's future. While the mother-in-law's situation is concerning, the author's decision is justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
