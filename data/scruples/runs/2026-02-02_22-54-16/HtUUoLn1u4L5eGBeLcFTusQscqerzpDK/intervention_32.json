My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not allowing his mother-in-law to move in with them. The author's main points are that his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, his wife wants her to move in due to loneliness, but he's concerned about his own comfort and future plans for another child. He also mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother and isn't trying to improve that relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is setting boundaries for his home, which is a valid concern. People have the right to feel comfortable in their own space. The mother-in-law's personality issues could make living together stressful. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the husband's mother might also influence her stance, but that's a separate issue.\n\nThe wife might feel that not allowing her mother to move in is selfish, but the husband's reasons are based on his well-being and future family plans. It's a balance between compassion for the mother-in-law's loneliness and the husband's need for a harmonious home environment. The husband is also suggesting alternatives like assisted living, which shows he's trying to find a solution rather than just refusing outright.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for the husband to come off as dismissive of his wife's and mother-in-law's feelings. The wife's perspective is that her mother deserves family support, which is a common viewpoint. The husband needs to communicate his concerns without making it feel like he doesn't care. The key here is mutual respect and finding a compromise. Since the husband is upfront about his reasons and suggests alternatives, it might be a matter of differing priorities rather than right or wrong.\n\nIn many cases, family decisions involve compromise, and this seems like a situation where both sides have valid points. The husband isn't wrong for prioritizing his home's environment, especially if the mother-in-law is difficult. But the wife's feelings of loneliness and her mother's well-being are also important. The answer likely depends on the specific family dynamics and whether the husband's stance is seen as selfish or self-protective. Given the information, the husband seems to be in a reasonable position, so the answer would be B.\n"
