My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mother-in-law is 70 and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that the wife has a bad relationship with his own mother, not visiting her, etc. So there's some history of tension there.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is concerned about his living situation and future plans for another child. He's also worried about the dynamics with his mother-in-law. On the other hand, the wife sees this as selfish and there's the mother-in-law's loneliness to consider.\n\nBut the author is clear that he's not being unkind. He's offered alternatives like assisted living. The wife's stance on his mother adds to the conflict, making the author more resolute. The key points here are boundaries, respect, and the impact on the household.\n\nI think the author is within his rights to set boundaries in his home. He's being upfront, and the wife's reaction might stem from her own unresolved issues. The author isn't ignoring the mother-in-law's needs entirely; he's suggesting alternatives. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
