My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details provided. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions they have a free room and plan to have another child, so space might be an issue. They also suggest assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that idea.\n\nThe author also points out that their wife isn't kind to his own mother, not allowing visits and staying at a hotel instead. The author feels the situation isn't about fairness but about his own comfort and the potential stress of living with someone difficult.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and family dynamics. On one hand, the wife wants to support her aging mother, which is understandable. On the other, the author has valid concerns about the mother-in-law's personality and the impact on their family life. The author isn't being selfish, they're stating their boundaries. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother adds another layer, showing possible imbalance in the wife's approach to family relationships.\n\nAssisted living is an alternative, but the mother-in-law rejects it. The author is trying to find a solution, but the mother-in-law's resistance complicates things. The key here is whether the author has a right to refuse based on personal well-being and the family's future plans. \n\nIn many cases, family decisions require compromise. However, if the mother-in-law is indeed difficult, forcing the situation could lead to more stress. The author's stance is about maintaining their home's environment and their comfort. The wife's actions towards the author's mother might indicate she's not making an effort to maintain family ties, which could affect the author's decision.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons and are trying to balance their family's needs with their own well-being. The answer would be B.\n"
