My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is married to a woman whose mother is in her 70s and wants to move in. The author is reluctant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that his wife has been pushing for her mother to move in, but he's uncomfortable with the idea. The wife seems to think he's being selfish, and there's some tension there. Also, the author notes that his wife isn't kind to his own mother and doesn't make efforts to improve that relationship. He feels that his home should be a place where he's comfortable, and moving in his wife's mother would take away that comfort.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\n1. **Respect and Boundaries**: The author is upfront about his reasons. He's being honest about his feelings towards his mother-in-law. It's important to respect one's own boundaries, especially in a home. If he's uncomfortable, he's within his rights to set that boundary.\n\n2. **Family Dynamics**: The wife's mother is in her 70s and lives alone. There's a concern about her loneliness and well-being. However, the author suggests alternatives like assisted living. The wife's reaction to that suggestion is strong, implying that she thinks those options are worse than living with family. But the author is trying to find a solution that works for everyone.\n\n3. **Marriage Partnership**: The author is part of a partnership with his wife. Decisions about living arrangements should ideally be mutual. The wife's insistence and the author's reluctance show differing priorities. The author's stance is about maintaining his own comfort and the home environment. However, not considering the wife's feelings about her mother's loneliness might be a point of contention.\n\n4. **Reciprocity**: The author mentions that his wife isn't kind to his mother. This might add context to why he's resistant, but it doesn't necessarily justify his decision. If there's a pattern of one-sided treatment, that's a separate issue. However, the author's main concern is his own well-being in the home.\n\n5. **Future Planning**: The couple is planning to have another child. The wife's argument about having a free room might not account for future needs. The author is considering future family size, which is a valid point.\n\n6. **Assisted Living as a Solution**: The author proposed assisted living, which the wife rejected. This shows he's trying to find a solution, but the wife perceives it as a negative option. The author's suggestion might be reasonable, but the wife's emotional reaction complicates things.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author is not acting out of malice. He's setting boundaries for his own mental health and the home environment. However, the situation is complex because it involves family dynamics and mutual respect in a marriage. The wife's feelings and her mother's needs are important too, but the author's right to a comfortable home shouldn't be ignored.\n\nIn many cases, these scenarios aren't black and white. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being, especially when there are valid reasons (like the mother-in-law being difficult) and alternative solutions proposed. However, the communication style during the discussion might be an issue. The wife feels her mother's needs are being dismissed, which is a valid concern for her.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are about personal boundaries and the complexity of family situations. The author isn't being selfish if he's considering the impact on his own life and the home environment, and he's offering alternatives. The wife's perspective is valid too, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice his comfort unless there's mutual agreement.\n"
