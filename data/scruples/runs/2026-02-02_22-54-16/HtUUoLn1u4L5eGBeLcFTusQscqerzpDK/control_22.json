My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is at fault for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife is concerned about her loneliness and wants her to move in. The author, however, finds his mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He's upfront about his reasons but the conversation gets ugly. The wife feels he's selfish, and the author suggests assisted living, which the wife disagrees with. The author also mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, even avoiding staying with her. The author's main concern is maintaining his own comfort in the home.\n\nSo, the key points are: the mother-in-law's well-being vs. the author's comfort, the wife's push for her mother to move in, and the wife's poor relationship with the author's mother. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, family support is important, but so is personal well-being. The author isn't refusing to help out of selfishness but because he genuinely can't handle the mother-in-law's personality. However, the wife's mother is in a vulnerable age, and moving in with family can provide care and companionship. \n\nBut the author mentions that the wife is also not kind to his mother, which adds another layer. If the wife is already not maintaining a good relationship with his mother, maybe the author's stance isn't entirely without merit. He's protecting his home environment, which is valid. On the other hand, suggesting assisted living might be seen as a way to avoid responsibility, but the wife thinks those are harsh. \n\nI think it's a tough call. The author isn't necessarily being selfish but is prioritizing his mental health. However, the wife's mother's needs are also real. In AITA scenarios, there's often no clear right or wrong. But since the author tried to explain his reasons upfront and the wife is pushing back, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because he's standing his ground for valid personal reasons and has offered alternatives like assisted living.\n"
