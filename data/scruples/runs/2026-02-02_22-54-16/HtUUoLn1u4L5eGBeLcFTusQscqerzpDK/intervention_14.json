My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The options are A for yes and B for no. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's mother-in-law is 70 and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author feels it would be too hard because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's respectful but doesn't want her to live with them. The wife is upset, calling him selfish, and even though they have a free room, they're planning another child. The author suggests assisted living, which the wife rejects, comparing it to prison. Also, the wife isn't kind to the author's mother, not allowing them to stay with her when visiting his hometown, and refuses to improve their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's discomfort with his mother-in-law, the wife's push for her to move in, the author's family plans (another child), and the wife's own treatment of the author's mother. The user believes the author is not wrong, and I need to decide if that's accurate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the balance between personal comfort and family obligations. The author is clear that the mother-in-law is difficult for him, and he's being upfront. The wife is using the argument that they have a room, but the author has valid reasons\u2014his own family's needs and his personal well-being. The wife's refusal to consider alternatives like assisted living might indicate that her approach is rigid. Additionally, the wife's treatment of the author's mother could affect the dynamics. If the author's mother doesn't have a good relationship with his wife, it might be a bigger issue for the author to manage if his mother-in-law is also in the household.\n\nHowever, family support is also a consideration. The mother-in-law is elderly and alone, so there's a responsibility angle. But the author is prioritizing his home's environment and his family's future. The user's point is that it's not a tit-for-tat situation, so the author isn't trying to retaliate but rather making a personal choice based on his own experiences.\n\nI should also think about cultural expectations. In some cultures, living with extended family is common, but in others, it's less so. The author's stance might be more accepted in certain contexts. The wife's insistence could be seen as pushing her own preferences without considering the author's boundaries.\n\nSo, the author is standing his ground on a personal decision, and the wife is being critical. The author's reasons are about his own well-being and family planning. Since he's being honest and the wife is not showing effort in her own family relationship, the author's position seems justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
