My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that they have a free room but are planning another child. The wife is upset and sees the author as selfish. The author also brings up that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, which adds context.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, family dynamics can be complex. The author's reasoning is about their own comfort and their home being a shared space. They also suggest alternative solutions like assisted living, but the wife rejects that. The author's wife is making demands, but the author is setting boundaries. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize one's own well-being and living conditions? Many people might say no, especially if the mother-in-law is hard to be around. However, some might argue that family support is important, particularly for elderly relatives. The wife's reaction and the fact that she's pushing for the move could imply she's not considering the author's feelings. The author's mention of their wife's poor relationship with his mother adds another layer, suggesting possible double standards. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially since they are upfront and offer alternatives. The wife's insistence might be seen as unreasonable. So the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons and are asserting their comfort in their own home."
