My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the user not wanting their mother-in-law to move in with them and their wife. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The mother-in-law is in her 70s, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The user is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The wife is upset, calling the user selfish. The user also mentions their wife isn't kind to his mother, not staying with her during a visit. The user feels it's their home and they need to be comfortable.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and potentially in need of support. The wife might feel it's a family responsibility to help. On the other hand, the user has valid concerns about their own well-being and family planning (another child). The wife's behavior towards the user's mother could indicate a pattern of prioritizing her own mother over others, which the user might be reacting to.\n\nThe user's reasons are based on personal comfort and family dynamics. They proposed alternatives like assisted living, which the wife rejected. The user isn't being cruel but is standing by their boundaries. The wife's refusal to make any effort with the user's mother adds complexity, suggesting possible imbalance in the family relationships.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably or without empathy. The user here is being upfront and has legitimate reasons. The wife is pushing for something that could cause long-term stress. The user isn't shunning the mother-in-law but is considering their own life circumstances. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to a comfortable home, especially when considering future family plans. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
