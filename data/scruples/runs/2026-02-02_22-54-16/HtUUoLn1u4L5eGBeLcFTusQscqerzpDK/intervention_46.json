My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is being asked by their wife if their mother-in-law can move in with them. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They mention that the wife got upset, thinking it's selfish, and there's some back and forth about assisted living and family obligations.\n\nFirst, I should consider family dynamics. The author is part of a married couple, so both partners' needs should be considered. The author has valid reasons: the mother-in-law is hard to deal with, and the author values their home as much as their spouse. They also mention planning for another child, which uses up the extra room. That's a practical point. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife feels the mother-in-law is lonely and deserves support. The mother-in-law's perspective is that moving in with family is better than assisted living. But the author argues that assisted living might be better than a strained living situation. \n\nThe author also mentions the wife is unkind to his own mother, so there's some tension there. That might affect the author's decision-making, but he clarifies it's not a \"tit for tat,\" just reinforcing his resolve. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to take in family unless there's a legal agreement, but that's not the case here. Emotionally, the author is standing up for their own well-being. The key is whether the author's refusal is justified given the circumstances. Since they tried to offer alternatives (assisted living) and have personal reasons (difficulty with the mother-in-law, future child), it seems reasonable. The wife might feel unsupported, but the author's perspective is about maintaining a comfortable home. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid reasons and considered alternatives, and respecting personal boundaries is important.\n"
