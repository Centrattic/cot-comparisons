My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their mother-in-law to move in with them. The scenario given is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, the author explains that their mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that they have a free room but also plan to have another child, so space is an issue. The wife got upset, called the author selfish, and the author suggested assisted living, which the wife rejected. Additionally, the author notes that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, refusing to stay with her and insisting on hotels, which the author sees as a lack of effort in mending their relationship.\n\nNow, considering the elements here. The author's main points are about their own comfort and the practicality of their living situation. They feel that the mother-in-law's presence would make the home less comfortable for them. They also mention the wife's lack of effort in their own mother's relationship, which might be a point in their favor when justifying their stance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From an ethical standpoint, people have the right to set boundaries in their own homes. The author isn't refusing out of malice but because of personal discomfort with the mother-in-law. However, there's a social expectation to support aging family members. But in this case, the author is prioritizing their own mental health and family's needs. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother might also indicate that the wife isn't exactly the most considerate person, which could support the author's decision.\n\nBut does the author have a responsibility to take in their mother-in-law? It depends on cultural norms, personal relationships, and existing family dynamics. Since the author has made clear their reasons, and the wife seems to be pushing without considering the author's feelings and the future plans (like having another child), the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. The author is standing their ground on a personal boundary, which can be valid if communicated respectfully.\n\nHowever, the author could be seen as inconsiderate if they didn't explore other options, but they did mention assisted living. The wife's actions towards the author's mother complicate things, as it shows a lack of reciprocity. So overall, the author's decision to not let the mother-in-law move in is based on valid personal reasons and practical considerations. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
