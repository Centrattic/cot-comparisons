My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The scenario is that the mother-in-law is elderly, lives alone, and his wife is pushing for her to move in. The author is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. There's also some background about the wife not getting along with his own mother and not staying with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasons are about personal discomfort and the potential impact on their home environment. He mentions that the mother-in-law is hard to be around, which is a valid concern. He also considers future plans for another child, which adds another layer. The wife, on the other hand, is focusing on the mother's loneliness and wants her to live with them. The author suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that idea.\n\nI should think about the balance between family obligations and personal well-being. While there's a cultural expectation in some societies to care for elderly relatives, the author is making a case about his own mental health and the practicality of their living situation. The fact that the wife isn't making an effort to improve her relationship with his mother might influence the perception of fairness here. If the wife is being unkind to his mom, the author's stance could be seen as justified, as he's prioritizing his own family's dynamics.\n\nAlso, the author is not being completely selfish; he's offering alternatives like assisted living, even though the mother-in-law disagrees. That shows he's trying to find a solution. The wife's accusation of selfishness doesn't hold if he's genuinely considering her mother's well-being through different options.\n\nOn the flip side, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which is a valid concern. In some cultures, family is expected to take care of elderly parents, but the author's situation involves personal compatibility issues. It's a tough call, but given the information, the author's reasons are based on personal experience and future planning, which are legitimate factors.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a reasonable decision based on his circumstances and has provided alternatives. The wife's push for the mother to move in might overlook the author's valid concerns about their living situation and mental health.\n"
