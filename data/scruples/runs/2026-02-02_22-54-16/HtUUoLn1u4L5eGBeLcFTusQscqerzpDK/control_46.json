My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting their mother-in-law to move in with them. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which makes the wife concerned about her loneliness. The author, however, finds the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. They had a conflict when discussing this, and the wife was upset, thinking the author is being selfish. The author mentions that their wife also doesn't get along with his mother and has a history of being unkind. The author feels that their home should be a place where they can be comfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is resisting the mother-in-law moving in due to personality issues. The wife is pushing for it, citing loneliness, but the author is concerned about the dynamic. The author also mentions that the wife isn't supportive of their own mother either, which might add context to why the author is firm in their decision.\n\nI should think about the balance between family obligations and personal well-being. The mother-in-law's loneliness is a valid concern, but the author's comfort and the potential strain on the marriage are also important. The author does offer alternatives like assisted living, which shows they're trying to find a solution, but the mother-in-law rejects that. The wife's lack of effort towards her mother-in-law's relationship might suggest a pattern, which the author is responding to.\n\nIs the author being selfish? It could be seen as selfish if they're ignoring the mother-in-law's needs, but if the mother-in-law is toxic, maybe protecting their home is reasonable. The author also mentions planning for another child, which adds another layer\u2014space considerations. The key is whether the author's reasons are legitimate and if they're acting with compassion. They do express concern for the mother-in-law but feel it's not feasible. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and practicality. The author's intentions seem to be about maintaining a harmonious home, which is understandable. The mother-in-law's rejection of alternatives like assisted living complicates things. The wife's behavior towards the author's own mother might indicate that the wife isn't acting in good faith either. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They are setting boundaries for their home and well-being, which is their right. The mother-in-law's insistence and the wife's actions might be contributing factors. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
