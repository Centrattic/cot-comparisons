My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife wants her mother to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The author is hesitant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They mention that the wife is less than kind to his own mother, which adds some context. The author wants to have another child and there's a free room, but they're worried about the mother-in-law's impact on their home life.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons: the mother-in-law's personality, the potential for conflict, and the need for a child. The wife, on the other hand, is pushing for the move, which the author feels is selfish. The author also mentions that suggesting assisted living was a mistake, as the mother-in-law reacted negatively.\n\nNow, considering social norms and family dynamics, it's common for people to have different levels of comfort with in-laws. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and family's future. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother might indicate some imbalance, but that's not directly the author's fault. \n\nAssisted living is a valid option, but the mother-in-law's reaction shows she doesn't want that. The author isn't being cruel by not accommodating her, especially if it would affect their home environment. They are being upfront about their feelings, which is important for maintaining trust in the marriage. \n\nHowever, the wife might feel neglected, which is a separate issue. But the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their own comfort for the mother-in-law's. The question is whether the author is selfish. The author's stance is that they have valid reasons and are considering their own family's needs. \n\nIn many cases, people have boundaries with extended family, especially if there are known issues. The author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. The conflict arises from differing priorities, not necessarily wrongdoing on the author's part. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
