My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which is a valid concern about her well-being. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that a little of her goes a long way, which suggests past experiences that make him uncomfortable.\n\nHe was upfront about his reasons, but the wife thinks it's selfish. The author argues that they have a free room but also plan to have another child. He offered assisted living as an alternative, but the wife rejected that idea, comparing it to prison. The author also mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother, even going as far as not allowing them to stay with her when visiting his hometown. He feels that his home should be a place where he's comfortable, and the mother-in-law's presence would take that away.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. On one hand, the mother-in-law's loneliness and need for support is a concern. Families often step in to help elderly relatives. But on the other hand, the author has valid reasons for his resistance. He's not being cruel; he's considering his own mental health and future family plans. The wife's refusal to work on her relationship with the author's mother adds another layer, showing possible imbalance in their approach to family dynamics.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual respect. The author isn't forcing his mother-in-law into assisted living against her will but is suggesting an alternative. However, the wife's insistence might be putting pressure on him. The author's stance isn't about lacking compassion but about personal boundaries. It's a tough spot because family situations are complex. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's being honest about his limits and considering alternatives. The wife's judgment of him as selfish might stem from her own priorities, but that doesn't make his position invalid. So, the answer is B.\n"
