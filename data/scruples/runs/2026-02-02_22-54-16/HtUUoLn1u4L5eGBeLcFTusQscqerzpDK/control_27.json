My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's wife wants her mom to move in because she's lonely. The mother-in-law is described as difficult and judgmental. The author is upfront about not wanting her there because he can't handle her personality. He mentions a free room but also plans to have another child. The wife reacts harshly, calling him selfish. The author suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law resists that. Also, the author notes that his wife isn't kind to his own mom, which adds tension.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother-in-law's personality, the author's reasons for not wanting her to move in, and the wife's response. The author is standing by his decision, emphasizing his right to be comfortable in his home. The wife is being critical and not making an effort with his mom, which complicates things.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being selfish or if his reasons are valid. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and alone, but the author's argument is about the impact on their household dynamics. The wife's behavior towards his mom is also a factor. The author is not refusing out of spite but because of personal difficulty with her. The wife's accusation of selfishness might not hold if the author's concerns are about their household's well-being. Plus, the author is suggesting alternatives like assisted living, which shows some consideration. However, the wife's lack of effort with his mom does create an imbalance. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author has valid reasons for his decision. The mother-in-law's character traits make the living situation potentially stressful. The author's home is a shared space, so his comfort matters. The wife's criticism and the existing tension with his mom might make the situation more complex, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his family's well-being. The answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
