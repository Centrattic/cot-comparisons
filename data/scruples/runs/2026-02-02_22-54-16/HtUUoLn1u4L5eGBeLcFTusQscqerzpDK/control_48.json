My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author mentions their mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They were upfront about their reasons. The wife thinks the author is selfish and argues that a free room exists, but the author wants to consider assisted living. The wife is also unkind to the author's own mother, not allowing them to stay and refusing to improve her relationship. The author feels it's about their own comfort in the home.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. The wife's perspective is that her mother is lonely and should live with family, while the author is concerned about the impact on their household. The key points here are the dynamics between the author and his mother-in-law being difficult, and the wife's treatment of the author's mother. \n\nThe author isn't refusing out of malice but because of personal comfort and the potential strain on their family, especially considering future plans for another child. The wife, however, is not making an effort to mend her relationship with the author's mother, which might indicate a pattern of prioritizing her own side. \n\nAssisted living is suggested by the author, which the wife dismisses. The author might be trying to find a solution that isn't ideal for the mother-in-law but is better for the overall family dynamic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's home is a shared space, so his comfort is valid. The wife's insistence seems to be pushing the author's boundaries. The author's refusal isn't based on the mother-in-law being a burden but on personal compatibility. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. The situation involves personal boundaries and the existing strained relationships. The author is upfront and considering alternatives, which shows they aren't indifferent. The wife's lack of effort in her own family relations might be a contributing factor. So the author's stance is reasonable.\n"
