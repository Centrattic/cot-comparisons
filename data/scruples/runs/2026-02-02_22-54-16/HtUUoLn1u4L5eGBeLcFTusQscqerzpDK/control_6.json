My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. His wife has been expressing loneliness, leading to the mother-in-law wanting to move in. The author is against this because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He's respectful but feels that living together would be too much. When they talked about it, the conversation got ugly. The author was upfront about his reasons, but the wife considered that selfish. The wife argues they have a free room and the author's counter about assisted living was met with resistance. Also, the wife isn't kind to the author's own mother, which adds to his resolve.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are autonomy in a shared household, mutual respect, and the dynamics between the couple. The author is setting boundaries for his own comfort, which is understandable. However, the wife's mother is in a vulnerable position, and the author's refusal might affect her well-being. But the wife's behavior towards the author's mother complicates things. If the wife isn't making efforts to repair that relationship, it might indicate a pattern of prioritizing her own mother over the author's family, which could justify the author's stance.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes practical aspects like future plans for another child and the potential strain on the household. He also suggests alternatives like assisted living, which shows he's trying to be considerate. The mother-in-law's resistance to those alternatives because she sees them as worse than prison adds another layer. The author is standing his ground, which is his right, but it's a delicate balance between family obligations and personal space.\n\nIn such situations, there's no absolute right or wrong. But given the details provided, the author is asserting his right to a comfortable home, which is valid. The wife's reactions and her handling of her own mother's situation might contribute to the tension, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for protecting his living environment. So the answer would lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
