My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author not wanting his mother-in-law to move in with them. The wife is pushing for it because she feels her mom is lonely and has a free room. The author is concerned about the mother-in-law's personality and the potential stress of having another person in the house, especially since they plan to have another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main reasons are that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, which makes him uncomfortable. He's also considering future family planning with another child. The wife, on the other hand, feels that the author is being selfish and not compassionate enough. The mother-in-law is upset because she thinks moving in with family is better than assisted living.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is setting boundaries for his home and his family's well-being. It's reasonable for him to prioritize his mental health and the environment for his children. However, the wife's concerns about her mother's loneliness are valid too. The conflict seems to stem from differing priorities. The author isn't ignoring the mother-in-law's needs entirely; he's suggesting alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects. \n\nBut the author is also clear that he doesn't want the mother-in-law living with them, and he's communicating his reasons. The wife might feel hurt because the author isn't supporting her emotional needs, but the author is standing his ground for practical reasons. In many cases, family decisions require compromise, but it's also important for individuals to protect their own well-being and family dynamics. \n\nThe author isn't being cruel; he's making a decision based on his comfort and future plans. The mother-in-law's judgmental nature adds another layer, making the situation more tense. So, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a tough situation, but he's making a choice that affects his own life and family, which he has the right to do. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
