My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is that the mother-in-law is 70 and lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author feels that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and they don't want to handle living with her. They also mention that they have a free room but are planning another child, so space is an issue. The wife got upset, thinking the author is selfish. The author suggested assisted living, but the mother-in-law's daughter (the wife) thinks that's like a prison.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the author's reasons: they don't want to live with a difficult person, which is a personal comfort issue. They also mention that they have plans for a child, so space isn't the only factor. The wife's side: she's concerned about her mother's loneliness and wants her to live with them. The author's own mother-in-law is unkind to his mother, which makes him more resolved.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, family decisions can be complex. The author is setting boundaries for their home and their well-being. It's understandable that they don't want to live with someone who's hard to be around. They also offered alternatives like assisted living, but the wife opposed that. The key here is that the author is prioritizing their own mental health and family planning. It's not about being selfish, but about maintaining a livable situation for their household. The mother-in-law's daughter (the wife) might see it as selfish, but the author has valid reasons. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
