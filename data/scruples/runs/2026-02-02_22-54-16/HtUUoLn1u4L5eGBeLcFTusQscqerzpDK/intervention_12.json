My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the author should let their mother-in-law move in with them. The author's main points are that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and they don't want to live with her. The wife is pushing for it because the mother-in-law is lonely and in her 70s. The author mentions they have a free room but also plan to have another child, which might affect space. They suggested assisted living, but the wife thinks that's harsh and prefers family care.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's mother-in-law isn't their own parent, so the author isn't the one who brought her into the family. The wife is the daughter of this mother-in-law, so she has a closer family bond. The author is standing their ground because they find the mother-in-law hard to live with. They also mention that the wife isn't kind to the author's own mother, which adds another layer of tension.\n\nNow, societal expectations might make people think that family should take care of elderly relatives. But the author's well-being is also a factor here. If the mother-in-law is difficult, it could strain the marriage if they move in. The author is prioritizing their own mental health and family planning (another child) which are valid concerns. The wife's unwillingness to work on her relationship with the author's mother complicates things further, showing that she might not be considering the author's side equally.\n\nAssisted living is an option they discussed, but the wife rejects it. Maybe the author is right to consider that, even if the wife doesn't like it. The author isn't refusing out of selfishness, but because they genuinely can't handle the situation. The key here is whether the author has a right to set boundaries in their home. Since it's their home as much as the wife's, they should have a say. The author isn't ignoring the mother-in-law's needs entirely; they're just not willing to sacrifice their household's comfort.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a tough decision based on their own experiences and future plans. The wife might feel slighted, but the author's reasons are legitimate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
