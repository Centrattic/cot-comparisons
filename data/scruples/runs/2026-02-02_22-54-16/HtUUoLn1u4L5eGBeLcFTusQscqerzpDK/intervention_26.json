My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are that his mother-in-law is difficult and hard to handle. He mentions she's judgmental, and he's worried about their future child and the available room. His wife is pushing for her mom to move in, arguing about loneliness and avoiding assisted living. The author feels that his home should be a place where he's comfortable, and he's standing his ground.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is concerned about her mother's well-being and loneliness. The author's mother-in-law also feels that moving in with family is better than assisted living, which she compares to prison. The author's wife isn't kind to his mother either, which adds tension. The author mentions that the wife's behavior toward his mother makes him more resolved to say no.\n\nNow, the key factors here are the dynamics of the family. The author is balancing his own comfort and future family needs against his wife's and mother-in-law's needs. The author isn't being selfish just for wanting to maintain his home environment. He's also considering practical aspects like another child. The mother-in-law's personality is a significant factor\u2014being difficult and judgmental would naturally impact the household dynamics.\n\nThe wife's lack of effort in her relationship with his mother might indicate deeper issues, which could support the author's decision. The author is being upfront about his reasons, which is important for communication. However, the wife feels this is selfish, which is subjective. The author is also offering alternatives like assisted living, which shows he's trying to find a solution that's not entirely neglectful.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for adult children to help aging parents, but it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. The author's right to his own home and comfort should be considered. The mother-in-law's well-being is important, but so is the author's mental health and the stability of his family unit.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say family should take care of each other, but if the mother-in-law is toxic or difficult, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author isn't refusing help outright but is proposing alternatives. The wife's own behavior towards the author's mother complicates things, showing that the issue isn't just about the author's stance.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a difficult decision based on his family's needs and his own well-being. The situation is complex, but his reasons are valid and he's being considerate by offering other options. The answer should be B.\n"
