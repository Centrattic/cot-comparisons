My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether not letting the mother-in-law move in is justified. \n\nFirst, the user says that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that they find her hard to handle and that a bit of her goes a long way. That suggests that living together might be stressful for the author. The wife wants her mom to move in, but the author is upfront about not wanting to, saying they can't handle her.\n\nThe wife is making the author feel selfish, but the author argues that they have a valid reason. They also mention that they considered alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected. The author also notes that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, which adds context about the wife's behavior towards in-laws in general. \n\nThe author emphasizes that it's their home too and they should be comfortable. The key here is whether refusing the mother-in-law's move is selfish or a reasonable boundary. The author isn't denying the mother-in-law's loneliness but is prioritizing their own well-being and the potential for another child. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother might support the author's stance that the wife isn't handling in-law relationships well, which strengthens their resolve.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't being inconsiderate without reason. They have legitimate concerns and are standing by their decision despite pressure. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
