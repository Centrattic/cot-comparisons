My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author is against it because his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's respectful but can't handle living with her. They had a conflict where the wife accused him of being selfish. He also mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mother and didn't let them stay with her. He feels that if the mother-in-law moves in, he'll lose his comfort in the home.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is not in the wrong if his reasons are valid and he's being honest. The wife's mother is in her 70s and alone, which is a valid concern, but the author is concerned about his own well-being and the potential strain on the household. He proposed assisted living, which the wife rejected, comparing it to prison. The author's stance is about maintaining his home environment, which is a common issue in such situations.\n\nThe wife's actions towards the author's mother are also a factor. If she's not making an effort to improve that relationship, it might reflect on her being more demanding. The author is standing his ground, which could be seen as reasonable if he's not being cruel or dismissive. Assisted living might be a better option for the mother-in-law's safety and well-being, but the wife is against any alternative that's not with family.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often depends on whether the person is being fair, compassionate, and compromising. The author was upfront about his reasons and offered an alternative. The wife's reaction seems harsh, especially since she's not extending the same courtesy to his mother. The author's resolve is strengthened by this, which makes sense. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's protecting his home and has valid concerns, and the wife's behavior is one-sided.\n"
