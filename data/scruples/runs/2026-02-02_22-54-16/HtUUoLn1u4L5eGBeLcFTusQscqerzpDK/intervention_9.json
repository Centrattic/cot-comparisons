My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, probably because she's feeling lonely and wants her mother to be closer. The author is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He's been respectful but doesn't think they can handle living together. He also mentions a free room, but they're planning to have another child, so space might be an issue. When the mother-in-law wanted to move in, the author suggested assisted living, which she took as a bad idea. The wife has a bad relationship with her mother and even refused to stay with the author's mother in her hometown, choosing a hotel instead. The author feels that his home is as much his as hers and wants to maintain comfort.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author is not being cruel; he's being honest about his feelings. The mother-in-law's well-being is a concern, but the author also has valid reasons related to his own comfort and family planning. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother might indicate a pattern where she's not prioritizing family harmony, which could affect the author's decision. The author is trying to balance his wife's desire with his own needs. \n\nAssisted living might be a good alternative for the mother-in-law, but she feels that's worse than being with family. However, the author's main point is that cohabitation would make him uncomfortable and potentially affect their family dynamics, especially with another child coming. \n\nIs it fair to say the author is in the wrong? The wife might feel he's being selfish, but the author's perspective is about his own limits and the practicalities of their home. Since he offered an alternative (assisted living) and is upfront, maybe he's not wrong. However, family situations can be complex. The wife's unwillingness to improve her relationship with his mother might mean the author is trying to avoid a similar situation with his mother-in-law. \n\nSo, the author's actions are based on personal boundaries and practical considerations. The mother-in-law's request is understandable, but the author's right to his home and comfort is also valid. The answer probably leans towards B (No), but I need to make sure there's no obvious wrong here. The wife might feel hurt, but the author isn't forceful or disrespectful. He's making a choice that prioritizes his household's well-being. Yeah, I think B is the right answer here.\n"
