My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether he's at fault for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the situation: The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it. He mentions that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's worried about handling her presence in the home. The wife got upset, called him selfish, and there's some history of tension, like the wife being unkind to his own mother.\n\nSo, the author's main points are about his comfort in his home and not wanting someone he finds hard to be around to live with them. The wife argues from compassion and family support, suggesting that the mother-in-law shouldn't be sent to assisted living. The author counters that a free room is for a future child, not for the mother-in-law. \n\nNow, considering family dynamics, it's a common issue where different family members have different priorities. The key factors here are the author's right to his own living space and the wife's push for family support. The author isn't denying help entirely\u2014he suggests assisted living, which he calls a mistake when the mother-in-law dismisses it as worse than prison. \n\nThe mother-in-law's behavior (difficult, judgmental) is a significant factor. If the author isn't comfortable, it's reasonable to set boundaries. However, the wife's perspective might be that family should take care of elderly relatives. But the author is balancing his home environment with the wife's and mother-in-law's needs. \n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and future family planning (another child) over the mother-in-law's request? It's a tough balance. Assisted living is an alternative, but the mother-in-law doesn't want that. The author isn't refusing help entirely but is choosing a different form. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author isn't being disrespectful; he's being honest about his limits. The wife might feel her needs aren't considered, but the author is also considering his own and future family. So, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to a comfortable home environment, especially given the mother-in-law's difficult nature.\n"
