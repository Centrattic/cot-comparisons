My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that they have a free room but are planning to have another child. The wife is upset and accuses the author of being selfish. The author also notes that the wife has a bad relationship with his own mother and doesn't make an effort to fix it.\n\nNow, considering the key factors here. The author's main argument is that they should be comfortable in their home. The mother-in-law's presence might lead to tension. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother is a red flag, showing possible lack of empathy or respect from her side. The author is upfront about their reasons, which is important. They also offered alternatives like assisted living, though the wife dismissed that.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a sensitive family matter. The author isn't obligated to have their mother-in-law live with them. Personal comfort and household dynamics are significant. The wife's insistence and the mother-in-law's difficult nature could lead to conflict. The author's mention of future plans for another child also adds to the pressure of space and resources.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for the author to be seen as inconsiderate if the mother-in-law's needs are genuine. But given the wife's own behavior towards the author's mother, maybe the author is trying to set boundaries. The key here is mutual respect and compromise. The author is standing their ground, which might be necessary for their well-being. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards B (No), as the author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their own living situation and comfort, especially with the existing tensions and future family plans.\n"
