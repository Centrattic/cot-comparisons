My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife wants her 70-year-old mother to move in because she's lonely. The author is against this because they find the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He mentions that the mother-in-law is being considered because of the free room, but they also plan to have another child. The author suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law objects to that, calling it worse than prison. The wife also has a poor relationship with the author's own mother, not allowing them to stay at her home.\n\nThe author feels that it's his home too and doesn't want to lose his comfort. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and maybe in need of support. On the other hand, the author is concerned about his well-being and family planning. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother complicates things, showing possible imbalance in how both sides are treated.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author has valid reasons about his living situation and personal comfort. However, there's also an obligation to consider family needs. But if the mother-in-law is difficult, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize his household's stability. Also, the wife's lack of effort in her own mother's case might mean the author isn't entirely wrong to resist. \n\nAssisted living is a suggested alternative, but the mother-in-law refuses. So the author is trying to find a solution, even if the other party isn't accepting it. The author isn't being selfish if he's considering future plans like another child. \n\nI think the key points are the author's right to his home and the difficulty of the mother-in-law. Since the wife isn't making efforts herself, maybe the author isn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
