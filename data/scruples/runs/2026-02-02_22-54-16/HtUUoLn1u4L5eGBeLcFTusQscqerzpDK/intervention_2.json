My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about not letting the mother-in-law move in with them. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion based on the provided text.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions they tried to be respectful, but a little of her goes a long way. They had a discussion where the author was upfront, and the wife got upset, calling it selfish. The author also points out that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay with her and instead insisting on a hotel. The author feels their home is as much his as hers and that the mother-in-law's presence would make him uncomfortable, leading to losing that comfort.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for declining: the mother-in-law's personality being difficult, the potential strain on the relationship with his wife, and the fact that the wife isn't supportive of his mother either. The wife is pushing for the move-in, possibly seeing it as compassionate, but the author feels it would be a mistake.\n\nI should consider factors like family dynamics, personal boundaries, and whether the author is being fair. The author is not refusing due to a lack of compassion but because of the mother-in-law's behavior and their own well-being. The wife, on the other hand, might be prioritizing her mother's needs over the husband's comfort. However, the husband's point about the free room and future child is valid. Assisted living is an alternative, but the wife rejects that, thinking it's like prison. \n\nIt's important to note that the author is in a marriage, and decisions about living arrangements should involve mutual agreement. The wife's insistence and the author's discomfort are both significant. The wife's treatment of the husband's mother might also affect the author's perspective, but the user says it's not a tit-for-tat situation. The author is focused on their own ability to be comfortable in the home, which is a reasonable consideration. \n\nIn many cases, it's not the author's responsibility to accommodate someone they find difficult, especially when it could impact their home life and future family plans. The wife might need to find a balance between supporting her mother and respecting her husband's boundaries. The author's resolve is based on the potential for conflict and loss of comfort, which are legitimate concerns. \n\nTherefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They are asserting their right to a comfortable home and considering the challenges the mother-in-law's presence might bring. The wife's perspective is also valid, but when it comes to personal living space, the husband's input is crucial. The answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
