My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife is suggesting she moves in. The author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that his wife is being unkind to his own mother, like not allowing them to stay with her. He wants to maintain his home as his own space and is worried about future plans like having another child.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's reasons for not letting the mother-in-law move in are based on his own comfort and the potential strain on the family dynamics. The wife is pushing for it, possibly out of guilt or trying to fix her own relationship issues with her mother. The author is standing his ground, emphasizing his right to a comfortable home and considering alternative solutions like assisted living.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's respecting his own boundaries and the future of his family. On the other, the mother-in-law's well-being is a concern. But the author is suggesting alternatives, which shows he's not uncaring. The wife's behavior towards his mother complicates things, indicating possible favoritism or unresolved family issues.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look for a balance between being considerate and maintaining personal boundaries. Since the author is upfront and has valid reasons related to his living situation and family planning, it seems fair. The wife's actions (not staying with her in-laws) might be a red flag, but the author isn't the one forcing the move. He's making a choice based on his circumstances, not just personal dislike. So, he's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
