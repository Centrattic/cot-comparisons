My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The writer's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The writer is concerned because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and they feel that having her live there would make them uncomfortable. The wife is upset, called them selfish, and the writer mentioned considering assisted living, which the wife took as a bad thing. Also, the wife isn't kind to the writer's own mother, not even allowing them to stay with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The writer is making a personal choice about their living situation, which affects family dynamics. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and might need support. On the other, the writer is prioritizing their own comfort and well-being. The wife's behavior towards the writer's mother adds another layer, possibly indicating a pattern of disrespecting the writer's family, which might influence the writer's stance.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about respecting others' feelings while standing by one's decisions. The writer is upfront about their reasons, which is important. They also have a future plan for another child, which might make the space issue more critical. But should they have to sacrifice their home's comfort for their in-law's needs? The wife's insistence and the previous treatment of the writer's mother could justify the writer's resolve. However, the writer's suggestion of assisted living might be seen as dismissive, even if it's a practical solution. The mother-in-law's feelings and the wife's perspective are valid, but so is the writer's right to a comfortable home. It's a tough balance. The writer isn't inconsiderate, but they are firm in their decision. So likely answer B.\n"
