My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their mother-in-law to move in with them. The situation is a bit complex because it involves family dynamics and personal boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author feels that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, so they don't want her to live with them. They had a conflict when discussing this, and the wife accused them of being selfish. The author also notes that the wife isn't kind to his own mother and even made them get a hotel instead of staying at his mom's house. \n\nNow, considering the author's reasons: they are concerned about their own well-being and the potential for family conflict. They also mention that they are planning to have another child, which might affect the living situation. The wife, on the other hand, is prioritizing her mother's needs but seems to be using guilt or emotional pressure, especially when she compares assisted living to prison and insists on family care.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, it's important to respect one's own boundaries and mental health. The author is upfront about their reasons, which are based on personal discomfort rather than just selfishness. They also seem to be trying to find alternatives, like assisted living, which shows they care about the mother-in-law's welfare but have concerns about cohabitation.\n\nThe wife's behavior towards the author's mother adds another layer. The author points out the wife's lack of compassion towards their own mother, which might indicate a pattern of behavior where the wife prioritizes her side of the family without effort. This could be a red flag, and the author's resolve to not let the mother-in-law move in might be justified to prevent similar treatment towards their own mother.\n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect to consider. In some cultures, taking care of elderly parents is expected, and not doing so might be seen as wrong. But the user didn't specify cultural context, so assuming a general approach, the author's stance is about maintaining a comfortable home environment. They are not refusing to help outright but are declining cohabitation while suggesting alternatives. \n\nThe mother-in-law's own actions (being judgmental and difficult) might make it hard for the author to handle living with her. The key here is whether the author is being reasonable in their refusal. Since they are honest about their feelings and propose other solutions, they might not be at fault. The wife's reaction could be seen as not respecting the author's boundaries and instead trying to guilt-trip them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They are asserting their right to a comfortable living situation and have valid concerns about potential conflict. The answer should be B.\n"
