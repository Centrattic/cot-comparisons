My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because they find her difficult and judgmental. The wife has been making comments about her loneliness, leading to the discussion. The author is planning to have another child and mentions their home has a free room. They suggested assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejected that idea, and the author's wife seems to have a poor relationship with the author's mother as well.\n\nThe author argues that it's their home too and they need to be comfortable. They don't want to compromise their living situation for someone they find hard to be around. The wife is upset, calling the author selfish. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a typical AITA perspective, people often consider factors like respect, family obligations, and personal boundaries. The author is being honest about their feelings towards their mother-in-law, which isn't necessarily selfish but about personal comfort. However, there's also the aspect of the wife's mother being elderly and isolated. The author offers an alternative (assisted living), but the mother-in-law finds that unacceptable. The wife's behavior towards the author's own mother adds another layer, maybe showing a pattern of difficulty in intergenerational relationships.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to their home and their discomfort with the mother-in-law. If the author made reasonable offers (like assisted living) and is upfront about their limitations, maybe they aren't at fault. However, the wife's perspective is that the author isn't compassionate. In many AITA cases, the community often balances these factors. Since the author isn't completely closed off (they considered alternatives) and are clear about their reasons, they might not be in the wrong. But it's a tough call because family situations are complex. The answer might lean towards B (the author isn't in the wrong) because they are setting boundaries for their own well-being, especially when considering future children and past issues with the wife's mother.\n"
