My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the post: The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The wife is upset because the author suggests assisted living instead, which she considers worse. The author also mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, like not allowing them to stay with her because of her own issues with his mom. The author feels this makes him more resolute in his decision, as he wants his home to be a place where he's comfortable.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which is a valid concern. Assisted living is an option, but the wife is resistant, thinking it's too harsh. The author is trying to balance the needs of their future child with the current living situation. Also, the wife's behavior towards the author's mother might be a red flag, indicating possible narcissistic tendencies or lack of empathy, which could make the author's stance more justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his discomfort. He's not forcing the mother-in-law to live in a prison-like facility; he's suggesting alternatives. However, the wife might feel neglected or think they're not being supportive enough to her mother. The author's main point is about the impact on their home life and their own mental well-being.\n\nI think the author is in the right because he's being honest about his limits. It's reasonable to prioritize one's mental health and the dynamics of the household, especially considering future plans like having another child. The wife's lack of effort to mend her relationship with the author's mother also suggests she might not be the most understanding person, which supports the author's decision to set boundaries. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
