My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their mother in law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details given. The mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They mention that they have a free room but plan to have another child, so space is an issue. The wife is upset, thinking the author is selfish. The author also mentions the wife isn't kind to his own mother and refuses to visit her, which might be a factor.\n\nNow, thinking about the moral implications. The author is standing by their decision because of their own comfort and the potential strain from a difficult person. But the wife is using the mother's loneliness and the idea of family support as leverage. The author's point about planning for a child is practical, as more space might be needed. However, the wife's refusal to mend the relationship with the author's mother could be seen as contributing to the tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are setting boundaries in their own home. They have valid concerns about their living situation and personal well-being. On the other hand, the mother-in-law's needs are legitimate too. But the key here is that the author is not neglecting the mother-in-law; they suggested assisted living. The wife's reaction and the mother-in-law's judgmental nature might make it hard to blame the author entirely. The wife's actions towards the author's mother also show a lack of effort, which might tip the scales. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's decision is about their own home and well-being. They aren't ignoring the issue but are making a choice based on practical and personal reasons. The answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
