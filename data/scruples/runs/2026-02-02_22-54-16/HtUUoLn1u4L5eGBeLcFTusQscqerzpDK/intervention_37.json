My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The person argues that their mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and that their home is a shared space where the author needs to feel comfortable. The wife, on the other hand, thinks the author is selfish and wants to help her mother who is lonely.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother-in-law is elderly and lives alone, which might make her situation seem more sympathetic. However, the author is concerned about the mother-in-law's personality and their own well-being. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother also adds complexity\u2014she refuses to have a good relationship, which might affect the dynamics if the mother-in-law moves in. The author mentions wanting to have another child, so space is a factor too.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's important to balance the needs of all parties. The author isn't denying their mother-in-law support entirely\u2014they suggested assisted living. The mother-in-law, however, rejects that option. The author also mentions that their home is a shared space, so their comfort matters. But there's a potential for tension if the mother-in-law moves in, given her personality and the wife's past behavior towards the author's mother.\n\nI need to check if the author is being unreasonable. They aren't refusing help entirely but are setting boundaries for their own mental health and family planning. However, the wife's perspective is also valid in wanting to support her mother. But the author's reasons are about their own capacity to handle the situation. It's a tough call, but since the author is upfront and considering alternatives, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The mother-in-law's rejection of assisted living might be her choice, but the author isn't obligated to host her. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author is prioritizing their own well-being and family needs, which is reasonable.\n"
