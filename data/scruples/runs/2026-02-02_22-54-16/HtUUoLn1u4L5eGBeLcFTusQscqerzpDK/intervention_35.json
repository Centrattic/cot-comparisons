My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author mentions that his mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which makes the wife feel lonely. The author is reluctant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He's upfront about his reasons, and the wife thinks he's selfish. The author also brings up that they plan to have another child, so there's a free room but space is a concern. \n\nThe author suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that idea. Additionally, the author notes that his wife is unkind to his own mother, which might add to his resolve. He feels it's his home too and that he should be comfortable.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Family dynamics are complex. The key points here are about autonomy and personal boundaries. The author has the right to set boundaries in his home. Even though his wife feels the mother should come, the author's comfort and the well-being of the household (including future plans for another child) are valid considerations. However, the mother-in-law's situation is also concerning\u2014living alone, potential loneliness, and needing support. \n\nBut the author isn't refusing out of malice. He's being honest about his limitations and suggesting alternatives. The mother-in-law's rejection of those alternatives is another factor. The author's wife's behavior towards his own mother complicates things, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong for prioritizing his own family's situation.\n\nIn many cases, family decisions require compromise. However, the author isn't obligated to host his mother-in-law if it's not feasible. His reasons\u2014personal comfort, future family plans, and the mother-in-law's personality\u2014are legitimate. The mother-in-law's reaction and the wife's previous inconsiderate behavior might justify the author's stance. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
