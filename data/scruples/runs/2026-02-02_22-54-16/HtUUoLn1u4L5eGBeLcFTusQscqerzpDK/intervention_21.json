My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. The situation is complicated because there are family dynamics at play.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which suggests she might need support. However, the author finds her difficult and judgmental. He's concerned about handling her presence, especially since they plan to have another child. He also points out that his wife isn't kind to his own mother, which might add to his hesitation.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that the author is selfish for not letting her mother in, even though there's a free room. The author counters by suggesting assisted living, which the wife rejects. The author's main argument is about his home being a comfortable space for him and his family, which is a valid point about personal boundaries.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the wife's mother may need care, and family support is often expected. On the other, the author has his own family's needs and well-being to consider. The fact that his wife isn't kind to his mother complicates things, but that doesn't necessarily justify his refusal. However, the author is clear about his reasons and has proposed alternatives. \n\nIt's a balance between family responsibility and personal well-being. Since the author is upfront and has valid concerns about the living situation and future plans, it's reasonable to see him as not in the wrong. His stance is about maintaining a comfortable home, which is a personal choice. So the answer would be B.\n"
