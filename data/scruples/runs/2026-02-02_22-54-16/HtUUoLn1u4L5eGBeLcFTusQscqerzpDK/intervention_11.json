My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand the situation properly.\n\nThe author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife has expressed loneliness, which the author anticipated would lead to a request for her mother to move in. The author is against this because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He's respectful but feels that a little of her is too much. When they discussed it, the conversation got heated. The author was upfront about his reasons, which the wife considered selfish. The mother-in-law mentioned a free room, but the couple is planning to have another child. The author suggested assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected, comparing it to prison. The wife has a bad relationship with the author's mother and even refused to stay with her during a visit, opting for a hotel instead. The author feels that allowing the mother-in-law in would make him uncomfortable and that his home should be a place where he feels comfortable.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my take. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making a personal choice about his living situation. He's not obligated to take in his mother-in-law, especially if it would significantly impact his well-being. The wife's desire for her mother to move in is understandable, given the mother's age and loneliness, but the author has valid reasons for his refusal. \n\nThe key points are the author's comfort and the potential impact on their home environment. The author also mentions planning for another child, which adds another layer to the space and resources needed. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother might indicate a pattern of imbalance, which could support the author's stance that it's a family issue not solely his responsibility.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for the author to be seen as selfish if his reasons are perceived as not considering his wife's and mother-in-law's feelings. But the author does suggest alternatives like assisted living, which shows some consideration. The mother-in-law's strong reaction to that option complicates things, as it's her own preference to live with family. \n\nIn many cases, such decisions involve balancing family obligations with personal well-being. Since the author is clear about his reasons and the potential consequences, it's a matter of whether the refusal is justified. Given that the author is also a co-owner of the home and has valid concerns about his own comfort and future family plans, it's reasonable to see him as not in the wrong. The wife's perspective is valid, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice his own well-being for her mother's needs, especially with the existing family tensions.\n"
