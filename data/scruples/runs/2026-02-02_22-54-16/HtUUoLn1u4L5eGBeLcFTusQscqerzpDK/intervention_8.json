My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is that the mother-in-law lives alone and is in her 70s. The wife wants her to move in, but the author finds her difficult and judgmental, and they also plan to have another child. The wife got upset, called him selfish, and insisted on staying with her own mother instead of his, which he finds unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the family. The author is part of a family unit with his wife, and they are planning to expand by having another child. Having someone else move in, especially a difficult person, could add stress. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and alone, which makes the wife's concern about loneliness valid. However, the author is clear that he's not comfortable with this situation.\n\nThe wife's behavior towards the author's mother is mentioned, where she wouldn't allow them to stay there and insisted on a hotel. This might indicate that the wife isn't making an effort to maintain a good relationship with the author's mother, which could be a point in the author's favor. He's defending his right to be comfortable in his own home, which is reasonable. \n\nBut then, the author also suggested assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected. The wife might feel that this is a harsh solution, even if it's a more practical one. The author's stance is that he's being honest about his feelings, which is important in a relationship. However, the wife might feel that her needs for her mother's well-being are being dismissed. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is being upfront and has valid reasons. He's not ignoring the problem but is offering alternative solutions. The wife's refusal to make any effort with his mother complicates things, as it shows a lack of compromise from her side. The author's home is a shared space, so his discomfort is a real issue. While wanting to help a parent is noble, the author's well-being and the future of their family should also be considered. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the author is standing up for his own comfort and family planning, and the wife's one-sided approach doesn't help the situation. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries in his own home.\n"
