My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The husband is against it because she's difficult and judgmental. He's upfront about his reasons, but the wife thinks he's selfish. The husband mentions they have a free room but also plan to have another child. The mother-in-law refuses to consider assisted living, calling it worse than prison. The wife also has a strained relationship with the husband's mother, not visiting or showing effort. The husband feels this strengthens his resolve.\n\nNow, considering the context. The key points are the husband's feelings about his living environment, the mother-in-law's personality, and the wife's behavior towards his own mother. The husband is standing his ground on his home being shared, which makes sense. He's not being cruel; he's practical. The mother-in-law's resistance to assisted living is a red flag, possibly indicating she's using emotional manipulation. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the husband's mother might contribute to the tension, but that's separate from the main issue.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband is asserting his boundaries. While the mother-in-law is in a vulnerable situation, the husband isn't obligated to take her in if it's not feasible. The wife's pushback seems to stem from her own feelings about her mother's loneliness, but the husband's comfort and future plans (like another child) are valid considerations. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's maintaining his boundaries without being cruel, and the mother-in-law's behavior isn't making things easier. The wife's actions towards his mother also add context that the husband's stance isn't entirely one-sided. So, B makes sense here.\n"
