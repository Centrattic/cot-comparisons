My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author finds her difficult and judgmental. He's upfront about his reasons, but the wife thinks he's selfish. The author mentions they have a free room and plan to have another child, so space might be an issue. He suggests assisted living, but the wife is against that, comparing it to prison. Also, the wife has a bad relationship with his mother and wouldn't let them stay with her. The author feels it's his home and that his comfort matters.\n\nI need to assess if the author is wrong here. On one hand, not allowing family to move in might seem selfish, especially if the mother-in-law needs support. On the other hand, the author has valid concerns about the living situation, future plans, and the wife's own behavior towards his mother. The wife's insistence on not helping her own mother might affect the dynamics. The author is standing his ground for his own well-being and family's future. \n\nBut maybe the author should consider compromises, like assisted living with more support, but the wife is resistant. The key points are mutual respect and family dynamics. The author isn't rejecting his mother-in-law out of malice but due to practical reasons and her personality. The wife's past actions (not staying with his mother) might justify his stance. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his home and family's needs, especially with valid reasons given.\n"
