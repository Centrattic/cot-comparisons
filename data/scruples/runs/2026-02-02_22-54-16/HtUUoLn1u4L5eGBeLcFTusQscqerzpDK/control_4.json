My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife is concerned about her loneliness. The author is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that a little of her goes a long way. They had a heated discussion where he was upfront but was called selfish. He also brought up the possibility of assisted living, but she rejected that idea, comparing it to prison. The wife also has a strained relationship with the author's mother, not even staying at her house. The author feels that his home should be a place where he's comfortable, and he doesn't want to lose that if the mother-in-law moves in.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's main points: he's concerned about his well-being and his wife's treatment of his own mother. He's considering future children and the available room. The mother-in-law's side is about loneliness and needing family support. The wife is pushing for the move, which adds to the tension.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's being honest about his feelings and limits. It's his home too, and he has the right to set boundaries. The wife's judgmental behavior and lack of effort in her relationship with his mother might be valid points the author uses to justify his stance. However, there's the other side that the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, so there's an expectation of family support in some cultures or situations.\n\nBut the author isn't refusing out of malice. He's concerned about his own mental health and the dynamic at home. He's also suggested alternatives like assisted living, even if she dismissed them. The key is whether he's in the wrong for prioritizing his family's needs and his own comfort. Since he's being honest and considering the situation, it's more about personal boundaries rather than selfishness. The wife's actions towards his mother also highlight that the dynamic isn't one-sided. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
