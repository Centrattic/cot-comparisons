My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me start by breaking down the situation as described.\n\nThe author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that his wife has been making comments about loneliness, leading up to this request. He was upfront about his reasons, which the wife took as selfish. The author also mentions that his wife is not kind to his own mother and refuses to stay with her, which strengthens his resolve. He argues that the home is his as much as hers and he should feel comfortable there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of family responsibilities and autonomy. Is it reasonable for the author to set boundaries regarding his living space? He's concerned about his mother-in-law's behavior and how that would affect their household. He also points out that they plan to have another child, which might take up the available room. The wife's unwillingness to put effort into mending her relationship with the author's mother could be a factor too.\n\nBut then, there's the other side: the mother-in-law is elderly and alone. The wife might feel responsible to care for her mother, especially if there's no other family to do so. The author suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that, seeing it as worse than prison. So the author's alternative is valid, but the mother-in-law doesn't want it. \n\nIs the author being selfish by not accommodating his wife's request? Or is he protecting his own household's well-being? The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. He's honest about his feelings and is considering alternatives like assisted living. The wife, on the other hand, seems to be unwilling to compromise and is perhaps expecting the author to take on her mother's care without considering his own comfort and future plans.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's behavior towards the author's mother. If she's already not kind and refuses to visit, that might indicate a pattern of prioritizing her own needs over family harmony. The author's stance could be seen as standing up for his own family's space and his right to a comfortable home.\n\nBut maybe there's an expectation in some cultures that adult children should care for their aging parents. However, the author is married, and it's a joint decision. The wife's insistence might clash with the author's personal boundaries. \n\nI think the main issue is about mutual respect and compromise. The author isn't refusing without considering alternatives, and he's concerned about future family planning. His wife's reaction might stem from feeling unheeded or not supported in her desire to care for her mother. However, the author's right to a home where he feels comfortable is also valid. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He's being realistic about the challenges and is considering other options. The wife's inability to see his perspective and the existing tension with his mother might make her reaction more intense. The answer would be B.\n"
