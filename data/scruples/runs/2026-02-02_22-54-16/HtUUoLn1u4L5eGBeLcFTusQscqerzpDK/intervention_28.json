My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. The situation involves family dynamics, personal boundaries, and differing values.\n\nFirst, the author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which is a valid concern. The wife wants her to move in, but the author has reservations because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's honest about his feelings, which is important. He mentions that he's respectful but finds her hard to handle. \n\nThe wife got upset when the author was upfront. The author's reasons include planning for another child and suggesting alternatives like assisted living. The wife reacted negatively, comparing those options to prison. The author also mentions his wife's poor relationship with his own mother, which might add to his hesitation about taking in her mother.\n\nI need to consider if being honest about one's feelings is selfish. The author is setting boundaries for his home and family, which is his right. The wife's reaction might be valid too, as she might feel her mother's needs are being ignored. But the author's discomfort is real, and his home is a shared space. \n\nAssisted living options could be a middle ground, but the wife's strong reaction complicates that. The author's resolve is strong because of his wife's lack of effort in her own family relations. However, that's a separate issue. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect, shared responsibility, and the right to set personal boundaries. The author isn't being inconsiderate; he's prioritizing his well-being and family's future. The wife's perspective is also valid, wanting to support her mother. But the author isn't obligated to host someone he finds challenging. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to a comfortable home while the wife is pushing for her own priorities. Both have valid points, but the author isn't at fault for being honest and setting limits."
