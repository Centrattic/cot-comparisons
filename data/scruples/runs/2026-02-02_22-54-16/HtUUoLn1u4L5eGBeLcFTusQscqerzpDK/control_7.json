My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. So, the author's main points are that their mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, they have a free room but plan to have another child, and their wife isn't kind to his own mother. \n\nFirst, the author is upfront about their reasons, which shows they tried to communicate honestly. The mother-in-law wants to move in, but the author feels it would make the home uncomfortable. They also mention considering assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that idea. \n\nThe wife's behavior towards the author's mother adds another layer. The wife's insistence on getting a hotel instead of staying with the author's mom might affect the dynamics. The author feels that their home should be a place where they feel comfortable, which is a valid perspective.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the author's justification based on personal comfort and the mother-in-law's personality. The author isn't being selfish if they're honest and have valid concerns. Also, the wife's treatment of the author's mother might indicate a pattern that the author is trying to avoid. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have legitimate reasons and communicated them. The mother-in-law's expectations and the wife's behavior towards the author's mom support the author's stance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
