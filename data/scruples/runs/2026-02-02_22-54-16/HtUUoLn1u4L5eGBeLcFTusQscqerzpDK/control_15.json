My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (AITA) is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author's mother-in-law wants to move in with them. The author is reluctant because she's described as difficult and judgmental. The wife is pushing for this, arguing that the mother is lonely and that they have a spare room, plus they're planning another child. The author suggests assisted living, but the wife gets upset, saying that's worse than prison. The author also mentions that the wife is unkind to his own mother, not even allowing them to stay with her during a visit.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is standing his ground because of his discomfort with his mother-in-law's personality. The wife is pushing for her mom to move in, possibly out of guilt or loneliness for her mother. The author is concerned about the impact on their family planning (another child) and his own well-being.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being selfish. On one hand, wanting to live comfortably with his wife and future children is valid. On the other, the wife's mom is elderly and alone. But the wife's lack of effort to improve relations with her own mother might be a red flag. The author is trying to be respectful but also setting boundaries.\n\nAssisted living was suggested, but the wife rejected it. The author's stance is that he's not in the wrong because he's maintaining his home's environment. The wife's actions (not allowing them to stay with his mother) might show she's not prioritizing family harmony, which could support the author's position.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. He's making a tough but reasonable choice for his family's well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
