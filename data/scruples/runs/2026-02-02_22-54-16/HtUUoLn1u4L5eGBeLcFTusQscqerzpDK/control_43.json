My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. The situation involves the mother-in-law being in her 70s and living alone, which the wife feels is lonely. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's worried about handling her and also mentions the possibility of having another child, so the free room might be needed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, extended family living together is common and expected. But the author mentions it's his home as much as his wife's, so he has a right to his living space. The mother-in-law is described as difficult, which could make living together tense. The wife is pushing for her mother to move in, but the author feels it's a bad idea.\n\nThe wife's behavior towards the author's own mother is mentioned as an example of her being unkind and not making an effort. That might affect the author's perspective, making him more resistant. The author suggests assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects, comparing it to prison. That's a strong statement. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and the right to one's home. The author is being upfront about his reasons, which is important. He's not denying the mother-in-law's loneliness but is concerned about the dynamic. The wife is upset, calling him selfish, but the author's perspective is that he needs to feel comfortable in his own home. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider that both partners should have a say in their living situation, and given the mother-in-law's personality, the author is not being unreasonable. He's also considering future plans with another child. However, there's a responsibility to care for aging parents, but in this case, the author is offering alternatives like assisted living. \n\nThe wife's lack of effort in her own relationship with the author's mother adds another layer. It might make the author's stance more justifiable. The author isn't refusing out of selfishness but because he genuinely can't handle the situation. \n\nSo, likely, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). He's standing up for his own comfort and making a reasonable decision based on the circumstances.\n"
