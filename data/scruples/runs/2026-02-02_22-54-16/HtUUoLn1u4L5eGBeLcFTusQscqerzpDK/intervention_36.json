My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing his mother-in-law to move in with them. The situation involves family dynamics, personal boundaries, and differing opinions on caregiving.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's mother-in-law is 70 and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author finds her difficult and judgmental. He's concerned about space since they plan to have another child. The wife is upset, calling him selfish, and there's a history of tension between the wife and his mother. The author feels that his home should be a comfortable space for him and his family.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the wife is worried about her mother's well-being, which is valid. Many people feel a responsibility to care for aging parents. On the other hand, the author has legitimate concerns about his living situation and mental health. It's important to respect personal boundaries and mental health, especially in a shared living arrangement.\n\nThe author isn't refusing to help entirely; he's suggesting alternatives like assisted living. He just doesn't want her in their home. The wife's refusal to engage with his mother adds complexity but might not directly affect the current decision. The author's main argument is about maintaining comfort in his own home, which is a reasonable stance.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation to take in a parent-in-law. The decision is personal and depends on the individuals involved. The author is honest about his feelings and has considered alternatives. He's not ignoring the situation but is setting boundaries for himself and his family's future.\n\nI think the key here is the author's right to set boundaries in his home. While the wife feels he's being selfish, his perspective is about mutual comfort and planning for their family's needs. So, based on the information provided, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
