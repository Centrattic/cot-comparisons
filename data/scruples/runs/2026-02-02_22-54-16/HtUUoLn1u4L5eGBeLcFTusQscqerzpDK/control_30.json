My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that his mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. His wife is pushing for her to move in, but the author is resistant because the mother-in-law is \"difficult and judgmental.\" He also mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother, not even allowing them to stay with her when visiting his hometown. The author feels that if the mother-in-law comes to live with them, he'll lose his comfort in his own home.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's reluctance is based on personal discomfort with his mother-in-law's personality, the wife's lack of effort in her relationship with her mother and his mother, and the potential future plans for another child. The author is defending his position by emphasizing his right to be comfortable in his home, which he shares with his wife.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the author is in a marriage where both parties should ideally have mutual respect and compromise. However, the wife is being dismissive of his feelings, labeling his concerns as selfish. The author's refusal isn't just about rejecting his mother-in-law but also about maintaining his own well-being and the family's future plans. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law's situation is valid\u2014she's elderly and might need support. But the author argues that assisted living could be an alternative, though she rejects that idea. The wife's behavior towards his own mother adds another layer, showing a lack of effort in familial relationships, which might justify the author's stance on wanting to prioritize his own family's needs.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If we consider the wife's perspective, she might feel neglected and that her mother's needs are being ignored. However, the author's perspective is about personal boundaries and the well-being of his household. It's a common conflict in blended families where everyone's needs must be balanced. The author is not being unkind but is standing his ground based on his own experiences and the potential impact on his family.\n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong because he's asserting his right to a comfortable home and is not ignoring his wife's mother's situation entirely by suggesting alternatives like assisted living. The wife's lack of effort with his mother also complicates the dynamic, making the author's position more defensible.\n"
