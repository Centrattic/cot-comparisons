My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and the author feels it would be hard to handle living together. They mention that their wife is pushing for the move, but the author is concerned about space since they're planning another child. The mother-in-law reacted negatively, feeling the author is selfish and that assisted living is a bad option.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which could be a valid concern. The wife is trying to help her parent. On the other hand, the author has legitimate concerns about their living situation and well-being. The author is also considering future family planning, which is a practical issue. \n\nThe author mentions that their wife is unkind to the author's own mother, which might add to the tension. The author's stance is about their right to a comfortable home. \n\nEthically, it's a balance between family obligations and personal boundaries. The author isn't refusing solely out of selfishness but based on realistic challenges. The mother-in-law's needs could be addressed through other means like assisted living, which the author did suggest, but the mother-in-law rejected that. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a decision based on their family's needs and their own well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
