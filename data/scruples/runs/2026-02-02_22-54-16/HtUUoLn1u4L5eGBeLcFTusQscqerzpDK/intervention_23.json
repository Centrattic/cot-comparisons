My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. The situation is that the mother-in-law is in her 70s and alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author feels he can't handle living with her because she's difficult and judgmental. The wife even got upset, called him selfish, and there's some back and forth about assisted living versus family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is about his home being his as well, and his comfort. He mentions that the mother-in-law is hard to be around, and he doesn't want to lose that comfort. On the other hand, the wife is pushing for her mother to move in, maybe out of concern for the mother's loneliness and the availability of a spare room. She might feel the author isn't compassionate enough, especially since the mother-in-law is her own mother.\n\nThe author also brings up that the wife has been unkind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay with her. That could be a factor in his decision-making, as he might feel that the wife isn't trying to maintain good family relationships. But does that justify his stance? Maybe not directly, but it adds context.\n\nLegally and ethically, a person has the right to their home and can decide who lives there. So the author isn't obligated to let his mother-in-law move in. However, the wife might feel neglected or that he's not supporting her family needs. The key here is whether the author is being considerate of both his wife's feelings and his mother-in-law's well-being. He suggested assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected, so there's an effort to find alternatives. But the mother-in-law's resistance complicates things.\n\nIs he in the wrong? If he's being respectful and considering alternatives, even if the wife disagrees, maybe not. But if he's dismissive of her concerns without valid reasoning, maybe yes. The author seems upfront about his reasons and doesn't want to compromise his living conditions. Since it's his home too, he's within his rights. The wife's reaction is valid, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for standing his ground. The answer might be B, no.\n"
