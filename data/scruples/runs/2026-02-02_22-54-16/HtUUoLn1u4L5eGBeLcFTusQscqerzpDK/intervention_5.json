My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The scenario involves a conflict between the author's comfort and his wife's desire to help her mother.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's worried about handling her presence in the home. He also points out that they have plans for another child, which might mean the extra room isn't just for the mother-in-law. He offered alternatives like assisted living, but his wife rejected that idea, thinking it's worse than prison. \n\nThe wife, on the other hand, seems to be pushing for her mother to move in, possibly out of loneliness. The author feels upfront about his reasons, but his wife thinks he's being selfish. There's also a mention of the wife not being kind to his own mother, which might add to the tension. \n\nNow, considering family dynamics, it's a common issue where personal boundaries clash with family obligations. The author is standing by his decision based on his own well-being and future plans. He's not ignoring his wife's mother's needs but is setting a boundary. His wife's response might be seen as unreasonable, especially since she's not making efforts to improve her relationship with his mother. \n\nAssisted living could be a valid alternative, but the wife's resistance suggests that she might not have considered her mother's actual needs or preferences. The author's main point is about maintaining his own comfort in his home, which is a valid concern. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's decision is selfish or a reasonable boundary. Since he's considering future family plans and the mother-in-law's personality, it seems more like a reasonable choice. The wife might be projecting her own feelings of guilt or loneliness onto the situation. So, the answer is B.\n"
