My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting the mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author is against it, saying the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions they have a spare room but also plan to have another child. The wife is upset, calling him selfish. The author also points out that the wife is unkind to his mother, not even allowing them to stay with her when visiting his hometown.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for not wanting the mother-in-law to move in. He's concerned about the mother-in-law's personality and the impact on their home life. He also mentions the wife's unkindness to his mother, which adds context. \n\nNow, considering the possible arguments. On one hand, the wife's feelings and her mother's loneliness are valid. On the other hand, the author feels that his home should be a space where he's comfortable, and the mother-in-law's presence might disrupt that. The author also suggests alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the information given, the author is being honest about his feelings and is considering other options. He's not dismissing his mother-in-law's loneliness entirely but is concerned about the living arrangement. The wife's behavior towards his mother complicates things, showing that there's existing tension.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often hinges on whether the person is unreasonable. The author has valid reasons based on personal comfort and past experiences. The wife's criticism of him as selfish might be unfair if he's been respectful and offered alternatives. The fact that the wife is also unkind to his mother suggests that the conflict isn't one-sided, which might support the author's stance.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's position seems justified. He's standing up for his own well-being and the dynamics of his household, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
