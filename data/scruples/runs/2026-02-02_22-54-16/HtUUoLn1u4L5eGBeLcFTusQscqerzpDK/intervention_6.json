My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. So, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife is pushing for her to move in, but the author is against it. The main issues seem to be the mother-in-law's personality\u2014described as difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. \n\nHe had a confrontation with his wife where he was upfront about his reasons. The wife felt it was selfish and argued that they have a free room. The author brings up their plans for another child, suggesting space is a concern. The wife then accuses him of lacking compassion and he suggests assisted living, which she rejects. \n\nThe author also mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay with her. This seems to add context that the wife's family dynamics are problematic. The author is standing his ground because he values his comfort and home environment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and possibly needs support. The wife feels the author is selfish for not supporting the move. On the other hand, the author is concerned about his own well-being and the potential stress of living with someone he finds difficult. He's also considering future family plans (another child) and space constraints. \n\nThe wife's behavior towards the author's mother might indicate a pattern of not valuing his family, which could support his resolve. However, the mother-in-law's need for companionship is valid. But if the mother-in-law is difficult, it's understandable the author wants to avoid conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, societal norms might expect family support, but personal well-being and household dynamics are also important. The author isn't refusing out of malice but based on personal capacity. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a hard choice for his family's sake.\n"
