My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing his mother-in-law to move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's wife wants her mom to move in because she's lonely and 70. The author feels his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and he's worried about their future baby. He suggested assisted living, but she rejected that idea. Also, the wife isn't nice to the author's mom, not even allowing visits to her place.\n\nThe author argues that it's his home too and he should be comfortable. So, is he wrong? Well, family decisions are personal. The author has valid reasons: his mental health, family planning, and past experiences with the wife's behavior towards his mother. He's not being selfish if he's considering his own family's well-being. The mother-in-law's needs are important, but the author's ability to maintain a comfortable home for his family matters too. The answer probably leans towards B, not in the wrong. But I should check if there are cultural expectations or other factors. However, the question doesn't mention cultural context, so stick to the given info. The author's boundaries are reasonable.\n"
