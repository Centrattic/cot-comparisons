My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves not allowing his mother-in-law to move in with them. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife has been expressing loneliness, leading to the discussion about her moving in. The author is hesitant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. The conversation got heated when he was upfront about his reasons, which the wife labeled as selfish. He suggested assisted living, which she rejected, comparing it to prison. Also, the wife is not kind to his own mother, even going as far as not allowing them to stay with her during a visit to his hometown. The author feels this situation would make him uncomfortable and affect his home environment, especially considering their plans for another child.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's main argument is about his own comfort and the future plans for a child. The wife, on the other hand, is advocating for her mother's needs. The wife's behavior towards his mother is also a factor. The key here is whether the author is being selfish or just standing up for his boundaries.\n\nI need to consider cultural expectations, personal boundaries, and family responsibilities. In many cases, family care is expected, but it's also important for individuals to set boundaries for their own well-being. The author is being honest about his feelings towards the mother-in-law. The wife's refusal to engage with his mother adds another layer, showing possible imbalance in the relationship.\n\nThe author's decision to prioritize his own comfort and future family planning seems reasonable. It's important to note that assisted living might be a better solution if it's suitable for the mother-in-law, but the wife's resistance complicates that. The author isn't being inconsiderate; he's trying to find a solution that works for everyone while maintaining his own home environment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and prioritizing his family's needs and his own well-being.\n"
