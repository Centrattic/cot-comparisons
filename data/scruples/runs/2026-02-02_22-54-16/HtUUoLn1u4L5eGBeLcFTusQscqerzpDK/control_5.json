My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband is against his wife's mother moving in because she's difficult and judgmental. He mentions that his wife has made comments about her loneliness, leading to the discussion. He was upfront about his reasons, but the conversation got heated. The wife thinks he's selfish, and he tried suggesting assisted living, which she rejected. Also, there's a mention of their relationship with his own mother being strained by the wife.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's reasons: he doesn't want a difficult person living with him, and he's concerned about future family planning (another child). The wife, on the other hand, feels he's being selfish and not considering her mother's needs. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics. The husband is standing up for his own comfort and boundaries. It's his home too, and if the mother-in-law's presence would make him uncomfortable, that's valid. But there's also the aspect of family responsibility. However, the wife's refusal to even try to improve her relationship with his mother might play a role here. If she's unwilling to make efforts, maybe the husband isn't entirely to blame.\n\nAlso, the husband's suggestion of assisted living was met with resistance, so maybe the wife isn't open to alternative solutions. The husband's perspective is that he's trying to find a solution but the options aren't working. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. If the husband is honest about his feelings and the wife is being unreasonable, he might not be in the wrong. On the other hand, if the mother-in-law is in a vulnerable position (70s, alone), there might be some expectation to help. But the husband's mental health and the home environment are also important.\n\nThe fact that the wife has already been unkind to his mother adds another layer. Maybe the husband isn't the only one at fault here, but the question is specifically about him. Since he's not forcing his mother-in-law to move in, and he's offering alternatives, perhaps he's not in the wrong. The main issue is the conflict between their two different needs: the wife's desire to support her mother versus the husband's need for a comfortable home. Since they are a married couple, they need to find a compromise, but the husband's stance seems reasonable given his reasons. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
