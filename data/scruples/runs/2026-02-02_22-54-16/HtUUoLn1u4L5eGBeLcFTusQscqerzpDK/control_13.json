My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author feels like the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that a little of her goes a long way, which suggests he has a hard time coping with her presence. Then there's the part where the wife accuses him of being selfish, and he proposed assisted living, which she rejected, comparing it to prison. \n\nAlso, the author notes that the wife has been unkind to his own mother, even refusing to stay with her when visiting his hometown and insisting on a hotel. He says it's not a tit-for-tat but that it strengthens his resolve. He's concerned about losing his home's comfort if the mother-in-law moves in.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's right to his own home, the wife's push for the mother-in-law, and the existing tension with the wife's mother. The author is feeling pressure to accommodate someone he finds difficult. The wife isn't making an effort with his mother either. \n\nI need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. On one hand, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and might need support. On the other, the author is not obligated to let her move in if it's causing him discomfort. The wife's behavior towards his mother adds another layer. It might be a point about fairness, but the author's stance is about his own well-being and home environment. \n\nAssisted living was suggested, but the wife dismissed that option. The author might be reasonable in thinking it's the best solution for her, but the wife's reaction complicates things. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's standing by his right to a comfortable home and the wife is being unreasonable, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he's being selfish without valid reasons, then maybe he is. \n\nBut given the details about the mother-in-law's personality and the wife's treatment of his mother, it seems the author has legitimate concerns. The decision to not let her move in is about maintaining his own space and not wanting to be in a strained living situation. So, probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
