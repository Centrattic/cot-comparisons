My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author's wife wants the mother-in-law to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that they are planning to have another child, so space is a concern. They offered assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejected that idea. Also, the wife has a strained relationship with the author's mother, refusing to engage with her.\n\nThe author is standing by their decision, feeling that their home is a shared space and they need to be comfortable. The main conflict is between the wife's desire to care for her mother and the author's discomfort with the mother-in-law's behavior and the practical aspects of space and future children.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In many cases, family dynamics and personal boundaries are involved. The author isn't being cruel; they're setting boundaries for their own well-being. The mother-in-law's behavior is described as difficult and judgmental, which can make living together stressful. The author also mentions practical reasons like space for another child, which is a valid consideration.\n\nThe wife might feel neglected or that her mother's needs are being ignored, but the author's perspective is about maintaining a livable environment. The question is whether the author's refusal is selfish. However, since they provided alternative solutions like assisted living and are upfront about their reasons, it's more about mutual respect and personal limits. \n\nIn such situations, it's common for couples to have differing views on caregiving. The author isn't denying the mother-in-law care entirely but is suggesting different arrangements. The key is whether the author's reasons are reasonable. Given the information, the author's concerns about the mother-in-law's personality and future family plans seem valid. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
