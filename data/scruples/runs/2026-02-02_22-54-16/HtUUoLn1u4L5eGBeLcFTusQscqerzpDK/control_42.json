My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not allowing their mother-in-law to move in. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that their mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her mom to move in, citing loneliness. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They also mention that the wife is not kind to the author's own mother, making the author more resolved to say no. The author suggests assisted living, but the wife rejects that idea.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The wife's perspective is that her mother is lonely and should live with family. The author's perspective is about their own comfort and the potential for a difficult living situation. Also, the author points out their wife's lack of effort in maintaining a good relationship with his mother, which might add context to the author's stance.\n\nLegal and ethical aspects: There's no legal obligation here. It's about personal boundaries and family dynamics. The author is within their rights to not want to have someone live with them, even if it's their spouse's parent. However, the wife might feel neglected or that her mother's needs aren't being considered. \n\nThe key points are respect, communication, and mutual understanding. The author was upfront about their reasons, which is good. The wife feels disrespected, but the author is standing by their decision for valid reasons related to their own well-being and the potential for family conflict. \n\nAssisted living is an alternative, but the wife rejected it, which complicates things. The author's mention of planning another child is a practical consideration too. The user might be weighing the mother-in-law's needs against the author's comfort and future plans.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, typically, the judgment hinges on whether the person acted unreasonably. Here, the author isn't being cruel but is prioritizing their own situation. Unless there's a legal or moral obligation (which there isn't), the author isn't in the wrong. The wife's approach might be seen as selfish if she's not willing to consider alternatives or the author's perspective. The author's point about their wife's treatment of his mother adds context that the wife isn't making the situation easier.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons and communicated their stance, even if the wife disagrees.\n"
