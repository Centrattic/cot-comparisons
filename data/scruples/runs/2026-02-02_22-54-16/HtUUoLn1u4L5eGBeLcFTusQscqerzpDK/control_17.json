My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's wife wants her mom, who is in her 70s and lives alone, to move in with them. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that the wife has a poor relationship with his own mother, not even allowing them to stay with her. The author is concerned about their future plans for another child and the available room. When discussing assisted living, the mother-in-law gets upset, feeling it's like prison. The author argues that his home is his as much as his wife's and he should be comfortable there.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and societal norms here. On one hand, the author has a valid reason to be concerned about his living environment and future family plans. It's reasonable to prioritize his own well-being and family's needs. The mother-in-law's personality could indeed make cohabitation stressful. The wife's lack of effort to improve her relationship with the author's mom might also be a factor in the author's stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which might make the wife feel responsible. However, the author isn't the one who has to live with her; it's a joint decision. The author isn't refusing out of malice but due to personal and practical reasons. The wife's behavior towards his mom complicates things, but the author is standing his ground for his home and family's future.\n\nLegal rights aren't the focus here, so it's more about moral responsibility. The author isn't being selfish without reason; he's considering his comfort and future. Assisted living options were suggested, but the mother-in-law rejects them. The author isn't obligated to have her live with them, especially if it would harm his mental health and family dynamics. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision seems justified. He's not in the wrong because he's making a choice based on his needs and family's well-being, not just for personal gain but also considering practical aspects like future children and the existing tensions in the family. The wife's perspective is understandable, but the author's right to his own living space and comfort is valid.\n"
