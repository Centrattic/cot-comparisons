My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their mother-in-law to move in. \n\nFirst, the situation: The mother-in-law is elderly and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the husband feels it's not feasible due to the mother-in-law's personality and their plans to have another child. The husband mentions that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, which he's tried to handle respectfully. He also points out that the wife has a poor relationship with his own mother, showing a pattern of the wife not getting along with his family.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's reasons. He's concerned about his own comfort in his home and the practical issue of needing space for another child. He also suggests alternatives like assisted living. The wife, however, is upset because she feels he's being selfish and not compassionate. The mother-in-law is against assisted living, seeing it as worse than prison, which complicates things.\n\nNow, considering if the husband is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother-in-law is his wife's mother, and there's an expectation in some cultures to support family, especially in old age. But on the other hand, the husband is also part of the household and has valid concerns about his living situation and well-being. His home is a shared space, and he has a right to feel comfortable there. The wife's behavior towards his mother doesn't help, showing that the wife might be prioritizing her mother over his family dynamics.\n\nThe husband isn't being uncompassionate; he's considering alternatives and is upfront about his reasons. The mother-in-law's negative traits make the living arrangement challenging. The user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the husband is standing up for his own family's needs and the wife has a history of difficult relationships, it seems like his stance is reasonable. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
