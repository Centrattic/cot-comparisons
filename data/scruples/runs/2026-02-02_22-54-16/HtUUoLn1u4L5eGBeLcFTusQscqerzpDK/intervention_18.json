My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. The author provided their perspective, and the user thinks they're not at fault but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that a little of her is a lot, which suggests significant tension. When they discussed it, the wife got upset, feeling he was selfish. The author proposed assisted living, but the wife rejected that idea, comparing it to prison and insisting family is the right place. Also, the wife has a bad relationship with the author's mother, even making them stay in a hotel instead of her house. The author feels that if the mother-in-law moves in, his home would lose its comfort.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The husband is sharing his concerns about his own well-being and the household's harmony. It's important to respect family members' needs, but it's also valid for the husband to prioritize his living environment. The wife's insistence on accommodating her mother while being unwilling to address her own relationship with the husband's mother adds complexity. This might indicate a one-sided approach to family responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law's situation is concerning because she's elderly and alone. Assisted living could be a viable option, but the wife's strong reaction against that suggests a lack of compromise. The key here is whether the husband's refusal is justified given the potential impact on his mental health and the household. The user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong, but I need to assess if there's a moral obligation to take in a family member versus personal boundaries.\n\nI should also consider if the husband communicated his reasons clearly and respectfully. He says he was upfront, so that's a positive. The wife might feel neglected, but the husband's stance is about personal comfort. It's a tough balance, but the presence of an existing strained relationship with the wife's mother-in-law and the possibility of future children's needs complicates things.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the answer hinges on respecting each other's boundaries and finding solutions that address both parties' needs. The husband isn't refusing out of spite but because of genuine concerns, while the wife is prioritizing her mother's welfare. However, the wife's unwillingness to consider alternatives or repair her own relationships might tip the scales. The husband's home is shared, so he has a right to be comfortable. The mother-in-law's potential move could disrupt that. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when the wife's approach seems dismissive of his valid concerns.\n"
