My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is pretty complex. \n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which raises concerns about her well-being. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that the wife has been unkind to his own mother, not even allowing them to stay at her place. \n\nThe author argues that it's his home as much as the wife's and that he should feel comfortable. He also mentions planning for another child, so a free room might be needed. But the wife interprets his refusal as selfishness. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother-in-law's loneliness and potential need for care is a valid concern. On the other hand, the author has legitimate reasons related to his own comfort and the dynamics with the mother-in-law. Also, the wife's lack of effort in her own relationship adds context. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect in the marriage, the author's right to his living environment, and the wife's expectations versus reality. The author isn't being asked to be selfish, but to live with someone he finds difficult. The wife's own behavior (not putting effort into her relationship with his mother) might be relevant here. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's a shared home, and both partners' comfort matters. However, there's a balance between compassion and personal boundaries. The answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. The wife's insistence and the author's valid concerns make it a complicated situation where the author isn't clearly wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
