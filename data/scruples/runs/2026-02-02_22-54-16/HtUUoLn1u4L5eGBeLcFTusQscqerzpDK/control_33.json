My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Their main points are that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and they want to keep their home comfortable. The wife is upset because the mother-in-law is lonely and they have a free room, but the husband mentions planning another child. \n\nFirst, the husband explains he's respectful but can't handle living with her. He was upfront about his reasons. The wife thought it was selfish. The mother-in-law's comments about assisted living being like prison are used against him. The husband also mentions that his wife is unkind to his mother, not even trying to repair that relationship.\n\nThe key factors here are the well-being of the husband and the existing family dynamics. The husband's concerns about his own comfort and the potential impact on their family (another child) are valid. The wife's mother's loneliness is a concern, but there are alternative solutions like assisted living. The wife's own behavior towards his mother complicates things. The husband is standing his ground about not wanting to compromise his home environment. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a personal decision about family boundaries. The husband isn't being selfish if he's considering the household's needs and his own mental health. The mother-in-law's and wife's reactions might be overreacting. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
