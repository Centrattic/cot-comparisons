My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is whether the person is at fault for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The user provided a detailed situation where the author's wife's mother wants to move in, but the author is against it because she's difficult and judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife is pushing for her to move in, but the author is uncomfortable with that. The author has a valid reason: the mother-in-law is hard to handle. That's a common issue in many families. The author tried to be upfront about their concerns and even suggested alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected. \n\nThen there's the mention of the wife's behavior towards the author's own mother. The wife's refusal to have a good relationship with the author's mom adds another layer. It makes the author feel like their own family isn't respected, which might strengthen their resolve to not let the mother-in-law in. The author also mentions planning for another child, which could affect the living situation. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In many cultures, family support is important, especially for elderly parents. However, the author's home is a shared space, and they have a right to feel comfortable there. If the mother-in-law is indeed difficult, forcing her into their home could lead to more conflict. The author is also considering future family plans (another child), which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, refusing to accommodate the mother-in-law might be seen as selfish if there's a room available and the mother-in-law is vulnerable. But the author is not being selfish in a bad way; they're being honest about their own well-being. The wife's previous behavior towards the author's mother complicates things further, as it shows a lack of reciprocity in family relationships. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is standing up for their own comfort and family's future. They're not ignoring the mother-in-law's needs entirely but are advocating for their own limits. The wife might feel wronged, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
