My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife wants her 70-year-old mother to move in because she's lonely. The author is against this because he finds the mother-in-law difficult, judgmental, and they have a free room but plan to have another child. They had a conflict where the author suggested assisted living, which the mother-in-law and wife rejected. The wife also has a bad relationship with the author's mother, not even staying with her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to determine if the answer is A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFactors to consider: The author is being honest about his discomfort with his mother-in-law. He's considering future plans (another child) which might affect the living situation. He's proposed alternatives like assisted living, though the wife disagrees. The wife's behavior towards his mother complicates things, showing a lack of effort on her part. The author's stance is about his own comfort in the home he shares equally with his wife. \n\nHowever, the wife's mother is elderly and alone, which might make the situation seem like the author is being selfish. The author is concerned about the impact on their family dynamics and future planning. \n\nBut the wife's refusal to engage with his mother might balance things out, showing that the wife isn't entirely considerate either. The author's reasons are personal and valid, as living with someone difficult can strain a marriage. The key is whether the author's refusal is justified given the circumstances. \n\nSince the author communicated his reasons upfront and is considering future family plans, while the wife is being inflexible and has existing issues with his mother, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
