My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details provided. The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. The wife claims this is selfish. The author mentions that they plan to have another child, so space is a concern. They've discussed assisted living, but the wife is against it, thinking it's like prison. Also, the author points out that his own mother isn't welcomed by his wife, which adds context to his hesitation.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's right to their home, the mother-in-law's well-being, and the wife's perspective. The author is concerned about his own comfort and the future plans for another child. The wife feels it's selfish, but the author is balancing his own boundaries against family obligations.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, family dynamics can be complex. While it's common for families to support elderly relatives, it's also important for individuals to maintain their own living space and mental health. The author isn't refusing out of malice but because he genuinely finds the mother-in-law difficult. The wife's unwillingness to improve her relationship with his mother might also play a role here, showing a lack of effort from her side.\n\nAssisted living is an option, but the wife's strong opposition suggests it's not viable. However, the author is trying to find solutions, even if they don't align with the wife's wishes. The fact that the author is upfront about his reasons and not hiding his feelings might make his stance more reasonable. He's prioritizing his own well-being and family's future, which can be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law has a right to family support, but the author's home shouldn't be a burden if it affects his quality of life. The answer might depend on cultural expectations, but in many cases, personal boundaries are valid. The author isn't being inconsiderate; he's making a difficult choice based on his circumstances. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
