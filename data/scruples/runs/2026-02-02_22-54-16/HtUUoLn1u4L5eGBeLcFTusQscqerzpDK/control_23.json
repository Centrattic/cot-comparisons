My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author is against it, saying his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that they have a spare room but are planning another child. The wife accuses him of being selfish. He suggests assisted living, but she rejects that idea. Also, the wife has a bad relationship with his mother and doesn't visit them there. The author feels it's his home too and wouldn't be comfortable with her mother there.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about family dynamics, personal boundaries, and the responsibilities towards elderly relatives. The author is standing his ground on not wanting to live with his mother-in-law, citing her personality and their own family plans. The wife is pushing for it, possibly out of empathy for her mother but maybe also other factors like guilt or pressure.\n\nI need to consider cultural factors. In some cultures, adult children are expected to take in elderly parents, but in others, it's more about personal choice and space. The author is setting a boundary, which is valid. However, the wife's mother is his spouse's parent, so there's an expectation sometimes. But if the mother-in-law is difficult, it's understandable the author doesn't want that.\n\nThe wife's actions towards his mother also matter. If she's refusing to engage with his family, maybe there's a pattern here. The author might be trying to avoid a toxic situation. It's a balance between supporting his wife's needs and his own well-being.\n\nAssisted living was suggested, but the mother-in-law rejected that. The author is trying to find a solution, but the wife is not seeing it. The author's stance isn't about not caring but about the living arrangement not working for him. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He has the right to his home and his comfort. The wife might need to find another solution for her mother's loneliness. The answer would be B, No.\n"
