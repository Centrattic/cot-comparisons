My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the author is at fault for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that his mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. His wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. But the user is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He's worried about handling her presence, even though he's respectful. The wife got upset, called him selfish, and he suggested assisted living, which she rejected. Also, there's a background issue where the wife has been unkind to the user's own mother, not even allowing them to stay with her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the user's reasons for not letting his mother-in-law move in. He's concerned about the stress and his own comfort in their home. He also mentions that they're planning to have another child, so space is a factor. On the other hand, the wife feels he's being selfish and that the mother should be with family instead of in assisted living.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The user's right to feel comfortable in his home is valid. It's his home as much as his wife's. If his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, living with her could cause a lot of stress. Also, the wife's past behavior towards his mother is a red flag, showing a lack of effort to maintain family relationships. That probably reinforces the user's stance.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of caring for an elderly parent. The wife's mother is alone and possibly in need of support. However, the user isn't the one responsible for her care; the wife is. The user is setting boundaries for their home, which is reasonable. The wife might need to find other solutions for her mother's living situation, like assisted living or other family members. The user isn't obligated to take her in if it affects his well-being and their family planning.\n\nThe user was upfront about his reasons, so he's not being secretive. The wife's reaction being \"ugly\" might mean she felt disrespected, but the user's position is justified based on his feelings and practical considerations. The fact that the wife has been unkind to his mother shows that family dynamics are strained, which adds to the user's resolve.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing up for his own needs and the home environment, especially when considering potential future children. The wife's mother's needs should be addressed through other means. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
