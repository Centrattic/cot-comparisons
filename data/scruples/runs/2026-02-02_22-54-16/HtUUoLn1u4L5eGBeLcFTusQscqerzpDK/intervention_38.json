My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is presented in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format. The author explains that their mother-in-law is difficult, judgmental, and hard to live with. They also mention that their wife has a bad relationship with the author's mother and refuses to put in effort to repair it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author is not willing to have a difficult relative live with them, which is a personal boundary. They provided reasons like the mother-in-law's personality and future plans for another child. They also suggested alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected. The wife, on the other hand, is portrayed as being less than kind to the author's mother and not making an effort in that relationship.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and fairness. The author seems to be standing up for their own comfort and family plans. While it's important to care for aging parents, it's also about personal limits and the well-being of the household. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother adds another layer, suggesting that the wife might not be handling family relationships well. The author's stance isn't about avoiding responsibility but about maintaining their own home environment. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
