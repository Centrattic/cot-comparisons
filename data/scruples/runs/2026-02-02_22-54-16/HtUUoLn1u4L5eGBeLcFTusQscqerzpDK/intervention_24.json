My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author is worried about their living space and potential future child. The wife got upset, thinking the author is selfish. The author suggested assisted living, but the wife rejected that idea. Also, there's a mention of the wife not having a good relationship with the author's mother and not staying with her.\n\nThe author's main points: They want to maintain their home as comfortable for themselves, especially considering future plans. They tried to be respectful but set boundaries. The wife's mom is hard to be around, so they don't want her to move in. The wife is pushing for it, and there's a history of tension between the wife and the author's mother.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is wrong. On one hand, the author is standing up for their own comfort and home. They have valid concerns about the mother-in-law's personality affecting their household. They also considered alternatives like assisted living, even if the wife didn't like the idea. On the other hand, the wife might feel neglected or that the author isn't showing compassion for her mother's loneliness. However, the author isn't the one who has to live with the mother-in-law daily; it's the wife's mother, so the wife's feelings are important, but so is the author's right to their own living space.\n\nAlso, the wife's treatment of the author's mother could be a red flag. If the wife is unwilling to make any effort with the author's mother, maybe she's not fair in relationships in general. The author is trying to maintain their own boundaries, which is understandable. It's a balance between family obligations and personal well-being. Since the author is clear about their reasons and tried to be respectful, they might not be in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
