My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong regarding not allowing their mother-in-law to move in. The situation involves family dynamics, personal boundaries, and differing perspectives.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They feel that having her live with them would make the home environment uncomfortable, which is a valid concern. The author is upfront about their reasons, which shows they're being honest, even if it's not what the wife wants. The wife, on the other hand, is pushing for her mother to move in, citing loneliness and the availability of a spare room. The wife also has a poor relationship with the author's mother, which adds another layer to the conflict.\n\nThe author argues that it's their home as much as the wife's, and they have the right to set boundaries for their comfort. They also mention considering alternatives like assisted living, which the wife criticizes. The key points here are autonomy over one's living space and the right to prioritize one's well-being. \n\nHowever, the wife's perspective is that she's trying to support her mother's well-being, which is also a valid concern. The conflict seems to be about differing values: the author prioritizes their own comfort and family planning (another child), while the wife prioritizes her mother's social needs and family support. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't being malicious; they have legitimate reasons for their stance. The wife, too, isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to support her mother. The question is whether the author is being selfish. The author acknowledges the wife's feelings but stands by their decision, which is a common situation in family dynamics. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to their own living space and to set boundaries that affect their quality of life. The key is that they're being honest and respectful, even if the decision is difficult for the wife. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong."
