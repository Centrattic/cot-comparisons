My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife has been talking about how lonely her mom is, and the author knows she's hinting at moving in. The author is upfront about not wanting to live with her, saying she's difficult and judgmental. The wife got angry, called him selfish, and argued that they have a free room and that assisted living is like prison. The author also mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, even making them stay in a hotel when visiting his hometown. The author feels it's his home too and not wanting the stress is valid.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, it's a tough one. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, so the wife wants to help. On the other hand, the author has legitimate concerns about the dynamic and his own well-being. The wife's refusal to make any effort with his mom adds another layer, showing possible hypocrisy or imbalance.\n\nThe key points are the author's upfront communication and his reasons. He's not being inconsiderate but is honest about his feelings. The wife is pushing for something that might cause conflict. The author's stance is about maintaining a comfortable home for himself and his family, especially considering future plans for another child. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't obligated to host someone that could make the household stressful. The wife's lack of effort with his mom also suggests she might not be handling the family dynamics fairly. The author is setting boundaries, which is important for a healthy relationship with his wife. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
