My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife is concerned about her loneliness and wants her to move in. The author, however, finds the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He's upfront about his reasons but the wife is upset, calling him selfish. The author mentions that they have a free room but are planning to have another child. The wife is also not kind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay with her and not making efforts to improve that relationship. The author feels that his home is his own and doesn't want to lose his comfort by having the mother-in-law live there.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is being honest about his feelings towards his mother-in-law. He's considering the future with another child. The wife is pushing for the mother-in-law to move in, but the author is against it. There's also a history of the wife not getting along with his mother. The author argues that it's his home as much as hers and he shouldn't have to compromise his comfort.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which could make the wife's concern valid. On the other hand, the author's discomfort is real, and he's not willing to compromise his home environment. The wife's actions toward his mother might be a red flag, showing a pattern of not valuing his family. The author is trying to balance his wife's wishes with his own well-being and future family plans. \n\nAssisted living was suggested, but the wife rejected that. The author might feel that he's considering alternatives, but the wife is not open to them. The author's stance is about personal comfort and family planning. It's a complex situation, but the author isn't necessarily being selfish if he's honest about his feelings and the potential impact on his family. The wife's insistence without considering his perspective could be the issue here. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no ethical obligation to take in a parent. However, the question is about being in the wrong, and since the author is being upfront and has valid reasons, he's not in the wrong. The wife's actions are the problem here. So the answer is B.\n"
