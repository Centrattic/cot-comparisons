My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not allowing his mother-in-law to move in with them. The key points from the scenario are:\n\n1. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which the wife feels is lonely.\n2. The author finds her difficult and judgmental, and he's concerned about the impact on his home and their plans for another child.\n3. The wife's mother is critical of the author's lack of compassion, suggesting assisted living as an alternative, but the mother-in-law rejects that.\n4. The wife has a strained relationship with the author's mother, making the author feel that the wife's stance is hypocritical.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective: He's prioritizing his comfort and the family's needs, especially considering their future child. He's being honest about his feelings towards his mother-in-law, which is reasonable. People have the right to set boundaries in their own home, especially regarding their living environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is advocating for her mother's well-being, which is also valid. However, the mother-in-law's personality issues and the wife's refusal to engage with the author's mother add complexity. The author's concern about the home being a shared space where both partners should feel comfortable is a significant point. \n\nAssisted living is an alternative, but the mother-in-law rejects it, so the author's suggestion might not be viable. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother might undermine her argument for her own mother's situation, suggesting a double standard. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while compassion is important, so is respecting one's personal living space and mental health. The author isn't being malicious; he's making a practical decision based on his circumstances. The wife's aggressive push and the mother-in-law's difficult nature complicate the matter. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. He's making a difficult choice that balances his family's needs and his own well-being.\n"
