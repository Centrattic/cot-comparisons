My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the author is at fault for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. When the wife brings it up, they argue. The author brings up having another child, so space is an issue. The wife accuses him of being selfish and not having compassion. He suggests assisted living, which she rejects. Also, the author mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, even refusing to stay with her. The author feels that his home should be a place where he's comfortable, and that moving in the mother-in-law would take that away.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and might need support. The wife is concerned about her loneliness, which is a valid concern. The author is considering the family's future, like having another child, so space is a practical issue. He's also thinking about the impact on his own well-being, saying that he can't handle the mother-in-law's personality. Also, the wife's behavior towards his mother complicates things, showing a lack of effort in family relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being upfront about his reasons. He's not making this decision out of malice but based on practical and personal comfort. The wife's insistence and the mother-in-law's judgmental nature could indeed make the living situation stressful. The author's suggestion of assisted living is a valid alternative, even if the mother-in-law resists it. The fact that the wife isn't treating his mother well might also justify the author's stance, as it shows a pattern of the wife not valuing family relationships, which could make the author more resolute in his decision.\n\nBut there's a balance between family obligations and personal well-being. The author isn't refusing out of selfishness but due to his own capacity and the family's future. The wife is pushing for her mother's move without considering the husband's perspective. The author's mention of having another child is a practical reason. The key here is whether the author's reasons are valid enough to not be in the wrong.\n\nIn many cultures, caring for elderly parents is seen as important, but it's also a personal choice. The author isn't ignoring his wife's mother's needs entirely; he's offering alternatives like assisted living. The mother-in-law's own behavior (being difficult and judgmental) is a factor that might make the author's decision reasonable. The wife's lack of effort towards his mother adds to the tension, and the author's need to maintain a comfortable home for himself and family is understandable.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's reasons are practical and based on his own well-being and family planning. While it's a sensitive issue, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
