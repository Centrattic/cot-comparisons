My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not allowing his mother-in-law to move in with them. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife is pushing for her to move in. The author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He's upfront about his reasons but the wife thinks he's selfish. The author mentions they have a free room but are planning another child, which might be a valid point. The mother-in-law also doesn't want assisted living, comparing it to prison. \n\nThe author also mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother, refusing to stay with her and insisting on hotels. He feels that his home should be a comfortable place for him too, and that having his mother-in-law there would take away that comfort.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's reasons are based on his own comfort and the practicality of their living situation (future child), while the wife is focused on her mother's needs. There's also a mention of the wife's own behavior towards his mother, which might indicate a pattern of her prioritizing her own family over his.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about balance. The author isn't being cruel; he's stating his boundaries. He's not refusing out of malice but because of his own well-being and the family's future. The wife's mother's needs are valid, but so is the author's right to a comfortable home. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with his mother might suggest she's biased, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right or wrong.\n\nThe author isn't dismissing the mother-in-law's loneliness entirely; he suggests assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects. The author has practical reasons (space for another child) and personal discomfort. So, the answer would likely be B (No), because he's standing up for his own needs and the family's situation, which is reasonable. The wife might be in the wrong for not considering their circumstances, but the author isn't necessarily at fault here.\n"
