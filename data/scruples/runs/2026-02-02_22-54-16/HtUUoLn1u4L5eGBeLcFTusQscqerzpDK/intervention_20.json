My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not allowing his mother-in-law to move in with them. The author explains that his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and he's concerned about their future child and his own comfort. His wife is upset because she feels he's being selfish and not compassionate towards her mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is being upfront about his reasons, which are based on his own comfort and future family planning. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, so the wife is concerned about her loneliness. However, the author points out that the wife has a strained relationship with her own mother and hasn't tried to repair it. That seems like a significant point because if the wife isn't maintaining that relationship, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on the husband.\n\nThe author mentions they could look into assisted living, but the wife rejects that idea. The husband's home is a shared space, so he has the right to his comfort. The wife's comments about loneliness might be valid, but if she's not putting in effort with her own mother, it's a bit contradictory. The author's main argument is about his own well-being and future family, which are personal and valid considerations.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. The husband isn't being cruel; he's stating his boundaries. The wife's reaction might be more about her own expectations and the mother-in-law's situation, but the husband isn't obligated to sacrifice his home environment for someone who's difficult. So, the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
