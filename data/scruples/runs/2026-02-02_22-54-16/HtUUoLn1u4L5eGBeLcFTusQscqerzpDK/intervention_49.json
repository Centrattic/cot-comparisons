My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that a little of her goes a long way. When they had the talk, the author was upfront about his reasons but the wife and mother-in-law got upset, thinking he's selfish. The author also points out that their wife isn't kind to his own mother either, which he uses as a counterpoint.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the perspective. So, what are the key factors here? The author's reasons are based on his comfort in his home and his assessment of the mother-in-law's personality. He also mentions planning for another child, which is a valid future consideration. The mother-in-law and wife's reactions suggest they feel uncompassionate, but the author is trying to balance family dynamics and personal well-being.\n\nIs the author obligated to let the mother-in-law move in? Well, it's a joint decision in a marriage, so both partners should have a say. The author is asserting his right to have a home where he feels comfortable. However, the wife is pushing for it, possibly expecting family support, which can be a common source of conflict. The author's mention of assisted living is a compromise, but the mother-in-law rejects it. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The author isn't being selfish if he's honest about his feelings. The wife's lack of effort towards his mother also adds context, but the author isn't in the wrong for not reciprocating in a tit-for-tat way. It's about maintaining a livable situation for the entire family, including future plans. So, I think the author is justified in his stance. Answer B.\n"
