My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. The situation involves family dynamics, personal boundaries, and conflicting emotions.\n\nFirst, the author explains their mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They mention respecting her but finding her hard to handle. The wife wants her mother to move in because she's lonely, but the author is against it, citing future plans for another child and the free room. The wife reacts negatively, calling the author selfish and insists on family time, even being unkind to the author's own mother. The author feels it's about their home and comfort.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's valid concerns about their living situation and future family, the mother-in-law's personality, the wife's lack of effort in her own relationships, and the author's stance on their home. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to maintain one's home environment and considering future needs is reasonable. The author isn't refusing solely out of selfishness; they have practical reasons. The mother-in-law's character is described as difficult, which complicates the situation. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother also shows she's not prioritizing family harmony. The author's resolve is based on legitimate concerns, not just personal dislike. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
