My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the husband feels he can't handle living with her because she's difficult and judgmental. The wife got upset, called him selfish, and there's some back and forth about assisted living and family dynamics.\n\nSo, the key points here are the husband's feelings about his mother-in-law and the wife's perspective. The husband is concerned about his own comfort and the potential for conflict. He also mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, which might influence his decision. The wife feels he's being selfish and not compassionate towards her mother.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's a tough call. On one hand, the husband has a right to feel comfortable in his own home. If living with his mother-in-law would cause significant stress or conflict, that's a valid concern. On the other hand, the wife is advocating for her mother's well-being, especially since she's elderly and alone. The husband offering alternatives like assisted living might be seen as a practical solution, but the wife perceives it as neglect.\n\nThe fact that the wife isn't making an effort with his mother adds another layer. It might make the husband's decision seem more justified in his eyes, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's right. The question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the husband's justification. If his reasons are based on genuine incompatibility and not just personal dislike, he might not be wrong. However, if it's purely about his discomfort without considering his wife's emotional needs, he could be seen as selfish. The text says he was upfront and mentioned future plans for another child, which adds to the space issue. \n\nBut the wife feels disrespected and that her mother's needs are being ignored. The husband's stance could be seen as valid if he's being honest about his limits, but the wife's perspective is also important. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and there's no clear right answer, but the husband's reasoning seems reasonable given his comfort and future plans, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance where he should have explored more options or communicated better. But given the details, B seems more likely.\n"
