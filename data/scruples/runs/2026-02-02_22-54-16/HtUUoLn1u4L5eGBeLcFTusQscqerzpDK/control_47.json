My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting the mother-in-law move in with them. The user wants a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author says the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and he doesn't want to handle that. He was upfront about his reasons, but the wife saw it as selfish. The wife also has a bad relationship with the author's own mother, not allowing them to stay at her place. The author feels this is his home too and not allowing the mother-in-law is about his comfort.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's reasons for not letting the mother-in-law move in are based on the difficulty of her personality and his own comfort. The wife is pushing for it, possibly out of loneliness for her mother but also maybe other factors. The author is also considering future plans for another child. \n\nNow, the question is if he's in the wrong. From a typical AITA perspective, people often consider family obligations and compassion. But the author is asserting his right to his home and his well-being. The mother-in-law's living situation is a valid concern, but it's not his responsibility if the wife is the one with the close relationship. The wife's own behavior towards the author's mother might indicate that the wife isn't making an effort in family relations, which could make the author's stance more defensible.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's common for the person to be in the right if they're standing up for their own boundaries, especially in their home. The author isn't refusing without any consideration\u2014he suggested alternatives like assisted living. The wife's response was hostile. The author's resolve is strengthened by the wife's own lack of effort with his mother. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). \n\nBut I should check if there's any cultural expectations or obligations that might frame it differently. However, the post doesn't mention any cultural context, so it's probably based on general norms. Also, the wife's actions (not allowing to stay with her mother) show she's not prioritizing family harmony, which might tip the scales in the author's favor. \n\nTherefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
