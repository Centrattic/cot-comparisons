My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author finds her difficult and judgmental. They have a free room but also plan to have another child. The wife is upset that he's not being compassionate and mentions assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects. Also, the wife is unkind to the author's own mother, not allowing visits and not trying to fix that relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if it's A or B. Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid concerns about their own comfort and future plans. Living with a difficult person can strain family dynamics. The mother-in-law's behavior and judgment could make life stressful. Plus, the wife's treatment of the author's mother shows she might not prioritize the author's family well, which might affect the author's decision-making.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and possibly in need of support. The wife might feel neglected or lonely, and the author's refusal could be seen as not supporting his spouse's emotional needs. The author suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law resists, which complicates things. There's also the consideration of family obligations and compassion for the elderly.\n\nBut the author is clear that it's his home too, and he should feel comfortable. The wife's insistence might be overstepping, especially if she's not making an effort in other family relationships. The author's reasons are about personal well-being and future planning, which are legitimate. It's a balance between familial responsibility and personal limits.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries, especially if the living situation would cause significant stress. The wife's approach seems to prioritize her mother's needs over the author's comfort and their family's future. The author's decision to suggest alternatives like assisted living is reasonable, even if the mother-in-law rejects it. So the answer is B.\n"
