My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about not letting the mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that the wife has a poor relationship with his own mother, not allowing him to stay with her. The author is worried about losing his comfort at home if the mother-in-law moves in.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is standing up for his own comfort and boundaries. He's not being disrespectful, just honest about his feelings. The wife seems to think he's being selfish, but the author is also considering future plans like having another child. He's offered alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother also shows a lack of effort on her part, which might strengthen the author's resolve.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's a personal decision. The home is a shared space, so both partners should have a say. The author isn't being cruel; he's being realistic about his ability to handle the situation. The wife's arguments might be valid, but the author has his own reasons and boundaries. Since the wife isn't making an effort with his mother either, there's a pattern here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being. Answer B.\n"
