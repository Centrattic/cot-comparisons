My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The key points here are the dynamics between the author, his wife, and his mother-in-law. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that his mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which is a valid concern. The wife wants her mother to move in, but the author finds her difficult and judgmental. He's upfront about his reasons but feels it's being perceived as selfish. The wife's counterarguments include the availability of a free room and future plans for another child. The author suggests assisted living, but the wife dismisses that as worse than prison. Additionally, the author notes that his wife has a poor relationship with his own mother, not even allowing them to stay with her, which adds context to their family dynamics.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and possibly in need of support. The wife is advocating for her, which could be seen as a compassionate move. On the other hand, the author is standing by his decision because of the potential stress and discomfort from living with a difficult person. The author also mentions that this is his home as much as his wife's, and he wants to maintain his comfort. \n\nIt's important to consider the balance between family obligations and personal well-being. The AITA subreddit often looks at whether someone is being unreasonably inconsiderate. The author isn't dismissing his mother-in-law's needs entirely; he's offering alternatives like assisted living. However, the wife is pushing for a cohabitation arrangement that the author isn't comfortable with. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother might also reflect on her willingness to compromise here. \n\nThe author is not being cruel; he's being honest about his boundaries. People have the right to set limits in their own homes, especially if living with someone could lead to significant stress. That said, there's a societal expectation sometimes to support elderly family members, but that doesn't mean the author is obligated to sacrifice his own well-being. The wife's insistence and the author's valid concerns about the mother-in-law's personality make the author's position understandable. \n\nIn the end, it's a conflict between two valid perspectives. The author's reasons are personal and based on his comfort, while the wife's are about supporting her mother. Since the author isn't ignoring the situation and is offering alternatives, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the Wrong).\n"
