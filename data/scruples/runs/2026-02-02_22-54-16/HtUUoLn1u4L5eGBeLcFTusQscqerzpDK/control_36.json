My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details provided. The author mentions their mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author is upfront about their reasons, but the wife is upset, calling the author selfish. The author also notes that their wife is unkind to his own mother and doesn't try to fix that relationship. The author feels it's their home and they should be comfortable.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's stance is based on their own comfort and the potential stress of living with someone difficult. They proposed alternatives like assisted living, but the wife rejected that. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother is also a point the author uses to justify their position.\n\nNow, considering cultural and social norms, it's common for families to have differing views on caregiving for elderly relatives. In some cultures, there's an expectation to care for aging parents, but in others, individual preferences might take precedence. The author's argument is about personal well-being and the practicality of having another child. They also mention that their wife isn't making efforts to improve her relationship with his mother, which adds to the complexity.\n\nThe key factors here are mutual respect and communication. The author was upfront about their feelings, which is important. They also offered alternatives, which shows they care about the mother-in-law's well-being but have limits. The wife, on the other hand, is pushing for the move, which could be seen as not respecting the author's boundaries, especially considering the existing tension with her own mother.\n\nIt's also important to consider the dynamics of the marriage. The author feels that allowing the mother-in-law to move in would compromise their home environment. Since it's a joint decision, both partners should have a say. The author isn't being cruel but is standing by their decision for valid reasons. The wife's reaction being \"ugly\" suggests there's conflict, but the author isn't the one at fault for setting boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own mental health and family planning while being considerate of alternatives. Their wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother further supports the idea that the situation isn't balanced. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
