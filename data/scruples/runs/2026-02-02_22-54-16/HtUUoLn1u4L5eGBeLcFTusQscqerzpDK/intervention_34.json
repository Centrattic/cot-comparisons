My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong regarding not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me start by breaking down the situation as described.\n\nFirst, the author's wife wants her mother to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The author is resistant because the mother-in-law is described as difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. The conversation turned ugly when he was upfront about his reasons. The wife accused him of being selfish, and he suggested assisted living, which she rejected, comparing it to prison. The author also notes that his wife has a poor relationship with his own mother, not even allowing them to stay at her parents' place and refusing to improve that relationship. The author feels it's his home too and that he should be comfortable.\n\nNow, I need to consider different angles. On one hand, the wife's mother is elderly and might need support. The wife is concerned about her mother's loneliness, which is valid. On the other hand, the author's well-being and comfort in his own home are also important. If living with a difficult relative would cause significant stress, that's a legitimate concern. The author is not dismissing the mother's needs entirely; he offers alternatives like assisted living, which the wife rejects. The wife's behavior towards his own mother complicates things\u2014it suggests a pattern where she's not making efforts to maintain family relationships, which might make the author more reluctant to accommodate her mother-in-law.\n\nEthically, this is a tough spot. Family dynamics can be complex. The author's right to a comfortable home versus the mother-in-law's need for care. The key points here are mutual respect and considering each other's perspectives. The author is being honest about his limits, which is important in a relationship. The wife, however, is pushing for her mother's integration into their home without considering the author's discomfort. The author's mention of wanting another child is also a factor, as space and resources might be limited.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his own needs and the well-being of the family's future. It's reasonable to have boundaries, especially if cohabitation would cause more harm than good. The wife's approach seems one-sided, not addressing the author's valid concerns. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
