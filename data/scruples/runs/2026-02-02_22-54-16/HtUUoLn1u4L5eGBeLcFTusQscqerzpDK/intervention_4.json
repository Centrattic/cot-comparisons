My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is explaining that their wife wants the mother-in-law to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They mention that the wife didn't consider the potential for another child and that the author tried suggesting assisted living, which the wife rejected.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's concerns about their own comfort and the future are valid. It's their home too, and they have a right to feel that. On the other hand, the mother-in-law's well-being is a factor. But the wife's behavior towards the author's own mother adds another layer. The wife's refusal to even visit her shows a lack of effort in family relationships, which might support the author's stance.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to their space, the wife's lack of effort with her own mother, and the potential strain on the household. The author isn't being selfish just for wanting to keep their home as their space. They're also considering future plans like another child. The wife's reaction being called \"selfish\" might be harsh, but the author's reasons are reasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons and are prioritizing their own well-being and family's future. The answer should be B.\n"
