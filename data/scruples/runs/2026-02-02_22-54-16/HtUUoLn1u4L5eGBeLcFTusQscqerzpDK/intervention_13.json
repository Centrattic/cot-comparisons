My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The person says the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They had a room free, but they want to have another child, and the mother-in-law's presence would make the home uncomfortable. The wife is pushing for her mom to move in, but the author is against it. The wife also has a bad relationship with the author's own mother, which adds to the tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is standing their ground because of the mother-in-law's personality. They mention that the mother-in-law is hard to handle and that living together would make the author uncomfortable. The wife is upset, thinking the author is being selfish. The author suggests assisted living, but the wife rejects that idea. The author also points out the wife's own lack of effort in their relationship with his mother, which might be a factor in their dynamics.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, it's about personal boundaries and family dynamics. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and comfort in their home. If the mother-in-law is difficult, it's reasonable to want to avoid a stressful living situation. The wife's push for the move might be driven by her mother's loneliness, but that doesn't obligate the author to agree, especially if it would harm their own household harmony. The fact that the author is willing to consider alternatives like assisted living shows they're not being completely dismissive, but the wife isn't receptive to that. Also, the wife's own issues with the author's mother might indicate a pattern of difficult relationships, which could justify the author's caution.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family support is important, especially for elderly relatives. But the key here is the author's right to their own home and comfort. If the mother-in-law's presence would make the home environment toxic, then the author is justified in saying no. The wife's approach seems to be more about her mother's needs without considering her husband's perspective. The author is not being cruel but is asserting their boundaries. So, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because they are protecting their home and well-being.\n"
