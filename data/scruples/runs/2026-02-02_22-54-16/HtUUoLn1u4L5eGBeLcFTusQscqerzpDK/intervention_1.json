My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about not letting the mother-in-law move in with them. The user says they don't want to because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The wife is pushing for her to move in, and the author is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main argument is that their home should be a place where they feel comfortable, and they can't handle living with a difficult person. They also mention that the mother-in-law is in her 70s and the wife is concerned about her being lonely, but the author is suggesting alternatives like assisted living.\n\nOn one hand, the wife is trying to be compassionate towards her own mother, which makes sense. But on the other hand, the author has valid concerns about their own well-being and the potential conflict. The author also points out that the wife isn't kind to their own mother-in-law, which is a bit of a red flag. If the wife is already not making an effort to have a good relationship with her mother, then moving her in might lead to more conflict.\n\nThe author's point about wanting to have another child also adds to the consideration of space. The wife's reaction to assisted living as \"a step above prison\" is a bit extreme, and the author might be trying to find a practical solution. \n\nI think the key here is about mutual respect and the right to a comfortable home. The author is not being inconsiderate by not wanting to take in a difficult relative. They are also not obligated to sacrifice their own living conditions for the sake of the wife's mother. The wife might need to find another solution, like assisted living or other family support. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. Their reasons are valid, and they are standing up for their own comfort and the potential future of their family. The answer should be B."
