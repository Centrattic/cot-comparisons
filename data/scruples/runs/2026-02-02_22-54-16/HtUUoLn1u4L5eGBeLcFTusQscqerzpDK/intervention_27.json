My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's mother-in-law is 70 and lives alone, which is a concern. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is uncomfortable because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that a little of her goes a long way, which suggests he's not in a good place to handle her full-time. \n\nHe was upfront about his reasons, but the wife got upset, calling him selfish. The author argues that they have a free room but are planning another child, so space is an issue. He also tried suggesting assisted living, but the wife dismissed that, comparing it to prison. Additionally, the wife has a bad relationship with the author's own mother, not even staying at her house, which the author feels is relevant because it shows her lack of effort in family relationships.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which might make the wife feel she needs to help her. On the other hand, the author is setting boundaries for his own well-being, especially considering his wife's behavior towards his mother. \n\nFamily dynamics can be really complex here. The author isn't ignoring his wife's concerns but is prioritizing his mental health. The wife might feel like he's not supporting her family, but the author is also part of a family unit and needs to feel comfortable in his home. \n\nAssisted living is a valid option, but the wife's strong reaction against it complicates things. The author's resolve is stronger because of his wife's treatment of his mother, which adds another layer. It's possible that he's not in the wrong because he's standing up for his own needs, especially if the wife hasn't made an effort in other family relationships. \n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's a lack of communication or compromise. The author tried to suggest alternatives but maybe didn't explore enough options? But given the wife's reaction and the existing tensions, it's a tough spot. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about respecting boundaries and trying to find solutions. The author is clear about his discomfort and is considering the future child. The wife's approach might be seen as pushing the author without considering his feelings. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
