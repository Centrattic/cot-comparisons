We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook. The girlfriend called it minor cheating. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a long-term female friend they meet occasionally, once every 1.5 months. They've both confirmed they only see each other as friends and don't want anything more. They usually like each other's posts on Facebook. The issue here is a specific photo where the friend is in a bikini while traveling, and the author liked it. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of physical attraction and a breach of trust, essentially calling it cheating.\n\nSo, the main question is whether liking a friend's photo, especially a bikini picture, is considered cheating. The girlfriend's point of view is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without potential for deeper feelings, and thus the like is a problem. The author feels it's unfair, but wants to know if they are the asshole here.\n\nFrom the author's side, they argue that their actions are within the bounds of a friendship and that they've made their intentions clear. They don't have any romantic feelings and their interactions are casual and platonic. However, the girlfriend is hurt and feels that the like is a sign of attraction. The problem here is about boundaries in a relationship and how actions are perceived.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. Even if the author's intention was just to like a photo, the girlfriend's perspective is important. What one person sees as a harmless action, the other might find hurtful or a violation of their trust. The fact that the girlfriend is equating the like with cheating shows that she's uncomfortable with the dynamic of the friendship, maybe due to jealousy or insecurity.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of having malicious intent, but the action still caused harm. The concept of cheating can vary between relationships. Some couples have strict boundaries about liking photos of others in certain attire, while others are more lenient. The author should consider their partner's feelings and the boundaries they've mutually agreed upon. Since the author didn't mention discussing these boundaries beforehand, it's possible they didn't realize how much the like would affect their girlfriend.\n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, equating a like to cheating. But if she feels that way, it's a valid emotional response. The author might need to apologize and reassess their behavior if it's causing distress. The key point is that even if the action seems trivial, it's about how it impacts the other person. So, while the author may not have done it with bad intentions, they are still in the wrong because their action hurt their partner and they should respect her feelings and the boundaries of their relationship.\n"
