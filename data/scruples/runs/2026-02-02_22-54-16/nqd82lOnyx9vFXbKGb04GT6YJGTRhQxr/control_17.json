We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about liking a female friend's Facebook photo where she's in a bikini. The girlfriend considers this a form of cheating. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author has a long-time female friend they see every 1.5 months. They're good friends, and they've both explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. Their interactions are casual\u2014movies, burgers, beer, chatting. They usually like each other's posts on Facebook. This time, the friend posted a bikini photo from a trip, and the author liked it. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's a sign of attraction and cheating. The author feels it's unfair and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the definitions of cheating and the boundaries in the relationship. Cheating typically involves emotional or physical infidelity. Liking a photo is a public action, but does it cross a line? The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention towards another person, especially in revealing clothing, is a sign of attraction and thus cheating. The author argues that they have no romantic feelings and that mutual likes are part of their friendship.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and relationship boundaries. Some people might see liking a photo as harmless, especially if it's a regular thing between friends. Others might be more sensitive, viewing even a like as flirtatious. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or specific boundaries set in their relationship. If the couple hasn't discussed what constitutes cheating, the author's action could be a gray area.\n\nBut the author didn't just like the photo; they admitted to liking other photos too. So, if the girlfriend is now taking offense to something that was previously okay, maybe there's a change in her feelings or expectations. The author might not have realized how sensitive this action is to the girlfriend. However, the author didn't engage in any direct communication or send messages to the friend, just a like. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that there's no such thing as a female friend, implying that any close relationship with someone of the opposite sex could lead to infidelity. This might be a controlling or overly possessive view. The author's actions don't seem malicious, but the girlfriend's interpretation could be based on her own insecurities rather than the actual action's intent.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend hasn't clearly communicated that liking photos is off-limits, the author might not be at fault. However, once the girlfriend has expressed her feelings, the author should consider her perspective even if they don't agree. The author could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings, which might be a mistake. But whether it's wrong depends on the agreed-upon boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. If the couple has no prior discussion about such actions, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the girlfriend has specific boundaries that the author should respect, then they are in the wrong for not considering her feelings. The question is whether liking a photo is a breach of trust. Since it's a public, minimal action and there's no evidence of deeper intent, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's emotional response is valid, and the author should address it to maintain the relationship. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) but with the need for better communication.\n"
