We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend wearing a bikini. The girlfriend considers it as minor cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and the friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have no attraction. They both stated they don't want anything more. The author usually likes each other's posts on Facebook. The friend posted a bikini photo, and the author liked it, which the girlfriend took as a sign of attraction.\n\nSo, the main question is whether liking a photo can be considered cheating. Cheating typically involves romantic or physical infidelity. But the girlfriend's perspective here is that the like shows attraction, which could lead to the relationship evolving. The author believes it's just a friendly gesture.\n\nI need to consider if the action crossed a boundary. The girlfriend's feelings are hurt, so even if the author didn't intend it, the act might have been disrespectful. The author's defense is that the friend is just a friend and there's no interest beyond that. However, the girlfriend's POV is that the like implies attraction. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If the couple has established that liking a friend's bikini photo is a red flag, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that. But if the girlfriend is overreacting without prior discussion about such boundaries, maybe she's the one being unreasonable. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author didn't think it was an issue, but the girlfriend did. The author should have considered her feelings and maybe discussed it. Liking a photo can be seen as a form of attention that the girlfriend might not be comfortable with, even if it's not a physical act. \n\nSo, even though the author's intention was innocent, the action still hurt the girlfriend. In that case, the author might be in the wrong for not being sensitive to her perspective. But if the girlfriend didn't set clear boundaries beforehand, maybe she's being too harsh. \n\nI think the answer would depend on the context of their relationship and prior agreements. Since the girlfriend labeled it as cheating, the author might need to take her feelings seriously and reconsider the action. But the author's argument that they're just friends and there's no attraction is also valid. \n\nHmm, tricky. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the intention was likely innocent, but A (in the wrong) if the girlfriend's feelings were disregarded. Maybe AITA forums often consider the person who caused emotional harm as the asshole, even if unintentional. But I need to decide based on the given info. \n\nSince the author didn't have the intent to cheat and there's no physical interaction, but the action upset the girlfriend, it's a matter of respect and communication. If they had discussed boundaries, the author might be in the wrong. But since they didn't, it's more about understanding the partner's feelings. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the like was a friendly gesture, but they should talk to their girlfriend about boundaries. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be considered over the top if there's no prior agreement. So the author isn't at fault, but the situation highlights the need for better communication between partners.\n"
