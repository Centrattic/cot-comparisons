We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong. The girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: the friend is someone they've known for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts. The issue here is liking a bikini photo, which the girlfriend interprets as a sign of attraction or cheating.\n\nThe key points to consider are the context of their relationship with the friend, the history of interactions, and the girlfriend's perspective. The author claims there's no romantic interest, just friendship. However, the act of liking a bikini photo might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the girlfriend feels uncomfortable.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. The girlfriend has expressed that such actions make her feel insecure. Even if the author means no harm, actions can have unintended consequences in relationships. The question is whether liking a photo is a minor transgression or a breach of trust.\n\nSome might argue that it's trivial, just a like on social media. Others might see it as a lack of respect for the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's perspective is that any sign of attention to another person, especially in revealing attire, could be a step towards infidelity. The author's defense is that the friendship is platonic, but the girlfriend's emotional reaction is valid.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend feels this is a problem, the author needs to address her feelings even if he sees it as harmless. However, whether it's the author's fault depends on mutual understanding and boundaries. If they had prior discussions about such actions, the author might be at fault for not respecting those boundaries. If not, it's a communication gap.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions, though innocent in his mind, disregarded his partner's emotional needs. The girlfriend's perception is that it's cheating, which means the author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings enough. But if there was no prior agreement to avoid liking such photos, maybe it's not his fault entirely. However, given that the girlfriend has expressed this as an issue, the author should be more mindful to avoid actions that cause insecurity. So leaning towards A (Yes) because the action, while not malicious, can still harm the relationship if the partner is uncomfortable with it.\n"
