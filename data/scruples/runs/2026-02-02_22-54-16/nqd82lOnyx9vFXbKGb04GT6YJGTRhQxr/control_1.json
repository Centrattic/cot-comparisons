We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the Facebook post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author liked a bikini photo of a female friend on Facebook, and his girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" The author is seeking to know if he's the asshole here. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he isn't). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and the female friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts. The girlfriend is upset because liking the bikini photo is seen as showing attraction, which she interprets as cheating.\n\nNow, the key points here are the definitions of cheating and what actions cross the line. Cheating typically involves romantic or sexual infidelity. But the girlfriend's perspective is that even the act of liking a photo can be a form of emotional or physical attraction, thus crossing into cheating territory. The author, on the other hand, believes it's just a friendly gesture and part of their usual interaction.\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics. In some relationships, certain actions are considered off-limits, even if they're innocent to the person doing them. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own insecurities or boundaries she's set in the relationship. The author might not have intended to cause harm, but if his actions make his partner feel insecure or violated, does that make him at fault?\n\nHowever, the author claims there's no romantic intent, and the friend is aware they're just friends. The act of liking a photo, even a revealing one, can be a common social media interaction. But the girlfriend's interpretation is that it's a sign of attraction. This is a classic case of differing perspectives on what constitutes appropriate behavior in a relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a neutral standpoint, if the girlfriend perceives it as cheating, does that make the author wrong? Or is it about the author's intent and the context of their relationship with the friend?\n\nIn many relationships, communication about boundaries is crucial. If the author didn't know that liking a photo was a boundary issue, maybe he should have discussed it. However, if the act itself is not inherently cheating, and the girlfriend is overreacting, then the author might not be at fault. But if the girlfriend has established that such actions are off-limits, then the author's lack of awareness or respect for her boundaries could be his fault.\n\nThe challenge here is determining whether the action (liking a photo) is objectively wrong or if it's a matter of the girlfriend's personal boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong if he didn't intend to breach those boundaries and if his actions are common in their friendship. However, if the girlfriend has communicated her discomfort with such likes, then the author should be mindful of that.\n\nIn the absence of prior discussions about this specific action, it's possible the girlfriend is projecting her insecurities. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate their boundaries. If the author didn't know his actions were an issue, but now he's aware, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the girlfriend has previously mentioned this, then the author might be at fault for not respecting her feelings.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't mention prior discussions about liking photos, it's more about differing interpretations. Since the author's intention wasn't to cheat, and the act is common on social media, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong if he didn't intend harm. It's a relationship issue that needs discussion rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
