We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user has a long-term female friend they meet occasionally, maybe once every 1.5 months. They both have clarified that they don't want anything more than friendship. The user likes their Facebook posts, including a bikini photo, and the girlfriend calls this \"minor cheating.\" The girlfriend's reasoning is that liking the photo shows attraction, which is cheating. The user feels it's unfair because they're just friends.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the definition of cheating and the girlfriend's perspective. The user's action is a like on a photo. Liking a photo is generally a positive reaction, but in a relationship, what's considered inappropriate can vary. The girlfriend feels that any form of attention that implies attraction, even if it's just a like, is cheating. The user argues that they've established a platonic relationship and that liking posts is just friendly interaction.\n\nI should consider if there's a breach of trust or boundaries. If the couple hasn't discussed what behaviors are acceptable regarding social media interactions with friends of the opposite sex, then the girlfriend might feel hurt because she interprets the like as a sign of attraction. On the other hand, the user didn't have any intention of being inappropriate; it's just a friendly gesture.\n\nCheating typically involves emotional or physical infidelity. Liking a photo isn't physical, but if the girlfriend perceives it as emotional infidelity, then it becomes a matter of trust and communication. The user might not be wrong in their intention, but if it causes hurt, maybe they should reconsider their actions to respect the partner's feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that they are good friends and have been clear about not wanting more might mitigate the situation. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid because in a relationship, partners have different comfort levels. The user might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but if the action causes distress, it could be seen as not being considerate enough of the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether intent matters more than the partner's feelings. If the user didn't mean to be flirtatious, but the partner feels hurt, there's a conflict. It's possible that the user isn't the asshole here, but maybe they need to adjust their behavior to accommodate the girlfriend's insecurities. But strictly speaking, is the user wrong? If there's no prior agreement about social media interactions, then maybe it's a misunderstanding rather than being wrong. However, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid, then the user's action, even if not intended, could be seen as harmful.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong for liking a photo, especially if it's a common practice between friends. But the situation shows a communication gap about boundaries. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a need for better communication.\n"
