We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who liked their friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as per their girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the background: They have a long-time female friend they see occasionally, and they've both agreed they only want to be friends. They like each other's Facebook posts normally, but this particular instance was a bikini photo. The girlfriend considers this a form of cheating, thinking it shows attraction.\n\nHmm, so I need to consider the dynamics here. The user argues there's no romantic intent, just friendship. But the girlfriend feels it's a breach of trust. The key is whether liking a photo in that context is a betrayal.\n\nI know that in relationships, what's considered cheating can vary a lot based on personal boundaries. The user says they both agree they're just friends, and they like each other's posts regularly. But the girlfriend sees liking a bikini photo as a sign of attraction. Maybe she's insecure or has specific boundaries about physical attraction expressions.\n\nI should also think about the friend's perspective. Even if the user isn't attracted, the act of liking a sexy photo might be seen as giving attention that the girlfriend doesn't like. It's possible the user isn't considering how their actions make their girlfriend feel, even if there's no intent to cheat.\n\nBut the user is maintaining that they're not in the wrong because there's no romantic intent. However, the girlfriend's feeling of being cheated on is real, even if it's based on interpretation. So maybe the user isn't aware of how their actions affect their partner's emotions, even if they're not malicious.\n\nIn some cases, actions can be considered cheating if they make the partner uncomfortable and violate their agreed-upon boundaries, regardless of the actor's intent. The user and his girlfriend might need to discuss boundaries around social media interactions to prevent future issues.\n\nBut the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether there was prior agreement on what's acceptable. Since they both considered themselves just friends, but the girlfriend views the like as a problem, maybe the user is in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries, even if unintentionally. Or maybe not, because he didn't have ill intent.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the user didn't have malicious intent, and the friend relationship was agreed upon. However, he might need to communicate better with his girlfriend to address her feelings. But strictly on whether he's in the wrong, maybe not. But others might argue that even without intent, actions can still harm, making him partially at fault. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n"
