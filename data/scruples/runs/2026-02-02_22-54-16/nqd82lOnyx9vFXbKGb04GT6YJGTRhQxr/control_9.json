We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend who called it \"minor cheating.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend is a long-time, platonic friend. They meet occasionally, have no romantic feelings, and they both agree they don't want anything more. The person in question just liked a photo where the friend is in a bikini. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and considers it cheating.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider both perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's side: They have a clear friendship, no intent to harm, and they believe their actions are innocent. Liking a friend's photo is a common social gesture. They argue there's no romantic intention because both parties have agreed on the platonic nature of the relationship. So, they might think they're not in the wrong.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She feels that liking the photo shows attraction and is a step toward infidelity. Her perspective is that such gestures can lead to deeper feelings and that there's no such thing as a purely platonic friendship between a man and a woman. She might feel insecure or betrayed even without clear intentions.\n\nKey points to consider: The concept of \"cheating\" or \"minor cheating\" can vary in relationships. Some people value emotional boundaries strictly, while others are more flexible. The author's actions might be innocent, but if it causes distress to the partner, it's a problem. However, whether it's \"minor cheating\" depends on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries. If they never discussed what behaviors are acceptable, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the girlfriend feels violated, the author should be considerate and maybe adjust their behavior to respect her feelings.\n\nIn many cases, communication is key. The author might not be intentionally wrong, but they should acknowledge their partner's feelings and perhaps avoid actions that could be misinterpreted. However, the act of liking a photo might be seen as harmless unless there's a prior agreement against it. Without such an agreement, it's more likely the author isn't in the wrong, but they should communicate to resolve the issue.\n\nSo, the answer would probably be B (No), because the author didn't have malicious intent and the actions were within a known friendship. However, it's a sensitive situation where the girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't necessarily at fault unless they violated specific agreed-upon boundaries.\n"
