We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that he liked a friend's Facebook photo where she's in a bikini, and his girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" He argues they're just good friends with no romantic feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is female, they've known each other a long time, meet occasionally, and have established boundaries. They both agree it's just friendship. He likes her posts, including this bikini photo. His girlfriend feels it's a form of cheating because liking the photo shows attraction.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries in a relationship and what actions are considered acceptable. The question is whether liking a friend's photo, especially one in a bikini, crosses a line. The author's girlfriend is upset because she interprets the like as a sign of attraction, which he denies.\n\nI should think about how relationships handle such things. Some people might see it as harmless, others as a breach of trust. The author's actions are within the bounds they set (no romantic intent), but the girlfriend's feelings are valid because in her view, any form of attention could lead to issues. The problem here is about differing expectations and communication.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or obviously unethical, but the issue is emotional. The girlfriend feels betrayed, which can't be ignored. However, the author isn't intentionally being disloyal. The answer would depend on whether the action itself (a like) is considered cheating. In many relationships, cheating involves more than just a like, but it's about mutual understanding and boundaries.\n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a situation where communication is key. The real issue is the girlfriend's perception and how they both define boundaries. The answer would likely be B (the author isn't in the wrong), but with the note that the situation depends on the couple's agreed-upon norms.\n"
