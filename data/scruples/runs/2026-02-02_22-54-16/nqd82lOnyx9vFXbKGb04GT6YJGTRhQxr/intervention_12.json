We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of a female friend on Facebook. The girlfriend is calling it \"minor cheating,\" and the author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The author and the female friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed that their relationship is strictly platonic. They often like each other's posts, and this particular instance was a bikini photo. The girlfriend is upset because she interprets the like as a sign of attraction or something more.\n\nSo, the key points here are the existing relationship boundaries between the author and the friend, the nature of the action (liking a photo), and the girlfriend's reaction. \n\nFrom a societal or ethical standpoint, the author's action seems minor. Liking a photo doesn't inherently imply attraction, especially if there's a history of mutual likes on various posts. The author and the friend have explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship, which adds to the argument that the like was innocuous.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is important here. If she feels betrayed, even by a small action, that's a valid emotional response. The question is whether the author's action crossed a boundary in the relationship. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the girlfriend's feelings are real. That said, whether it's \"cheating\" is subjective. Cheating typically involves breaking trust through infidelity, which a like doesn't constitute. But in some relationships, certain actions might be considered breaches of trust, even if they're not traditionally seen as cheating.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the agreed-upon boundaries in the relationship. If the girlfriend communicated that liking such photos is off-limits, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that. But if the girlfriend is making assumptions without prior discussion, the author might not be at fault. The situation seems more like a communication issue rather than a clear ethical violation.\n\nGiven that the author and the friend have a long-standing, clear friendship and the action was a common interaction (liking a post), the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The girlfriend's interpretation might be overreaching, but the core action itself isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
