We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong according to their girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The user and their friend have been friends a long time, meet occasionally, and have stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They like each other's posts on Facebook. The issue is when the user liked a photo of the friend in a bikini. The girlfriend sees this as a form of cheating.\n\nSo the main question is whether liking a friend's photo, especially when they're in a bikini, crosses a line. The user argues there's no romantic intent, but the girlfriend feels it shows attraction. The user's position is that it's a friendly interaction, but the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of physical attraction leading to cheating.\n\nI should consider the context: they have a clear agreement about staying friends. The user's actions are within the bounds of their established friendship, but the girlfriend is upset because she perceives it as a breach. The key here is consent and boundaries in relationships. The user didn't do anything that the friend would consider offensive, but the partner does. It's about mutual respect and communication.\n\nThe user isn't engaging in physical contact or anything overtly flirtatious, just a like on a post. But the girlfriend's feeling is that even a like indicates attraction. This might be a matter of differing perspectives on what constitutes cheating. Some relationships have strict boundaries around interacting with exes or potential romantic interests, but in this case, it's a friend with whom there's no romantic interest.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's interpretation is valid because in a relationship, both partners need to agree on what's acceptable. If the girlfriend feels upset, the user should acknowledge her feelings and maybe adjust their behavior to respect her boundaries, even if they see it as harmless. But whether the user is \"in the wrong\" depends on whether their action violated what was agreed upon in the relationship. Since the user didn't have romantic intentions, but the partner is upset, it's a matter of perspective.\n\nIn some cases, even small actions can be sensitive if one partner is particularly insecure. The user might not be at fault in terms of intent, but the action might still hurt the partner's feelings. The answer hinges on whether the action was a breach of trust or boundaries as perceived by the partner. Since the user and the friend have a clear non-romantic relationship, but the partner interprets the like as a sign of attraction, it's a nuanced situation. The user might need to consider if there's a way to better communicate or adjust their actions to prevent further hurt, but ultimately, the girlfriend's feelings are valid even if the user didn't mean any harm.\n"
