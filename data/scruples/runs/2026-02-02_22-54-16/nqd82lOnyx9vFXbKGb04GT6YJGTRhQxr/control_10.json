We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking his female friend's bikini photo, which his girlfriend considered minor cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and his female friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have clarified they don't want a romantic relationship. They often like each other's Facebook posts. The girlfriend is upset because the like on the bikini photo is seen as a sign of attraction, leading her to accuse it as cheating.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he sees no issue because they're just friends and he's not attracted to her. The girlfriend, however, believes that having a \"female friend\" inherently leads to developing feelings, so the like is a boundary crossed. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the definition of cheating and the expectations in the relationship. Cheating typically involves betrayal through romantic or sexual involvement with someone other than one's partner. Liking a photo doesn't equate to an affair, but some people might interpret certain actions as crossing lines, especially if their partner feels uncomfortable.\n\nThe girlfriend's POV is based on her perception that the like indicates attraction. The author argues it's just friendly interaction. The issue here is about trust and communication. If the girlfriend feels that action is a form of cheating, even if the author didn't intend it, it's a problem in the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, what constitutes cheating can vary based on mutual agreements. If the couple has discussed and agreed on boundaries, then the author's action might be a violation. However, if there was no prior discussion about such actions being off-limits, the author might not be in the wrong, but he's causing distress to his girlfriend regardless.\n\nThe author mentions they are good friends and have stated their intentions, so he might not have malicious intent. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Even if the action isn't cheating by traditional standards, the emotional impact matters. The author might need to consider his girlfriend's perspective and adjust his behavior if it's causing harm, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because liking a photo isn't inherently cheating, but the girlfriend's feelings are important. However, if the couple had specific boundaries, the author might be at fault. The question is whether the action was wrong based on typical standards. Since it's a social media like and not a romantic gesture, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But the situation highlights a communication issue rather than a clear right or wrong. The answer is B.\n"
