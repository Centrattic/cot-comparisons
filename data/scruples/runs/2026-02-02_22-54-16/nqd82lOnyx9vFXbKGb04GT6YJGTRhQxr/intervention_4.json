We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. The situation is about a guy who liked a photo of his female friend who was in a bikini on Facebook. His girlfriend thinks this is minor cheating because she interprets the like as a sign of physical attraction. The author argues that they've been good friends for a long time, they've clarified their boundaries, and they don't have romantic feelings towards each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friends met occasionally, once every 1.5 months, and their interactions are casual, like watching movies or hanging out. They've both stated they don't want more than friendship. The key point is the like on the bikini photo. Liking a friend's photo is a common social media action, often just a friendly gesture. However, the girlfriend feels it's a form of cheating, so there's a conflict here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. From a general perspective, liking a friend's photo isn't inherently wrong. People often like each other's posts without any romantic intent. But relationships come with expectations and boundaries. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attraction is cheating, which might be a strict view, but it's her feeling. However, the author's actions don't indicate any romantic intentions beyond friendship. They've established that their relationship is platonic. \n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation here? In some contexts, liking a photo might be seen as a neutral action, but in others, especially in a relationship, it could be misinterpreted. The author's girlfriend might be overly sensitive or have trust issues. On the other hand, if the author knew this would upset his girlfriend but still did it, maybe he's at fault. But based on the information, the author didn't intend any harm and the action itself is ambiguous. \n\nSo, the main factors are the intent, the existing boundaries between the friends, and the girlfriend's interpretation. Since the author didn't have romantic intentions and the friends had clear boundaries, it's more about the girlfriend's perception. The author isn't doing anything objectively wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
