We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook. The girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a long-time female friend they see occasionally. They've both agreed they don't want more than a friendship. They sometimes like each other's posts, including this bikini photo. The girlfriend is upset, thinking that liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nNow, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author argues that they have a platonic relationship with the friend and that liking the photo isn't a big deal. The girlfriend's perspective is that any sign of attraction, even a like, is crossing a boundary. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because in a relationship, jealousy or insecurity can make certain actions feel like betrayal, even if the person doesn't intend it. However, the author's intention was likely just a friendly gesture. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. If the couple had discussed boundaries beforehand, maybe the author should have been more aware. However, liking a photo is a common social media action. The friend is in a bikini, but the author and the friend have a history of mutual likes, so maybe it's just part of their normal interaction. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but that doesn't mean the author is entirely in the right. The author could have considered their partner's feelings and maybe refrained from liking the photo to avoid causing hurt. But the act itself, without more context or prior agreements to the contrary, seems like a minor issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's tricky. If there were no prior boundaries about liking photos, then maybe not. But the girlfriend's perception is that it's a violation, which affects the relationship. In relationships, how partners perceive actions matters a lot. The author might not be intentionally cheating, but the action caused hurt. \n\nIn some cases, people might say that if the partner is uncomfortable, then the action is wrong, regardless of intent. But others might argue that it's a misunderstanding. The answer really depends on the specific relationship and communication. Since the author didn't have prior discussions about this, it's hard to say they're definitely wrong. But the girlfriend's feelings are important too. \n\nI think the answer is leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the action was a normal, friendly gesture. However, the author could have been more considerate of their partner's feelings. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether the girlfriend's feelings are valid. \n\nSo, the answer is B for No.\n"
