We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for liking their female friend's Facebook photo where she's in a bikini. Their girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has a long-time female friend they see every 1.5 months. They're just friends, and both have confirmed they don't want anything more. They like each other's posts on Facebook, which seems normal. The friend posted a photo in a bikini while traveling, and the author liked it. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the nature of their relationship with the friend and the girlfriend's perspective. The author and friend have been clear they're just friends. Liking a photo is a common action on social media. But the girlfriend feels it's a boundary crossed. \n\nI need to consider social norms and the girlfriend's feelings. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, actions can have unintended consequences. The girlfriend might feel insecure or think that liking a revealing photo is flirtatious. But is it really cheating? Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. A like might be a small thing, but if it causes distress, maybe it's a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have ill intent. They've been friends a long time and there's no history of attraction. The girlfriend's view that there's no such thing as a female friend could be an issue here. Maybe she's projecting her own insecurities. But the author might need to consider why the like was a problem if it's causing conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the action was intentional or if they should have been more aware of their partner's feelings. If they knew their partner would be upset, maybe they should have avoided liking it. But since it's a common action and the friend is just a friend, maybe it's not wrong. However, respecting the partner's feelings is important. The author might not be in the wrong, but they should communicate better to avoid future issues. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a need for better communication.\n"
