We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about liking a female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and the girlfriend considers it cheating. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've known this friend for a long time and meet occasionally. They both have clarified that they don't want anything more than friendship. The friend posted a photo in a bikini, and the author liked it. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and sees it as cheating.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the context of the friendship and the girlfriend's perspective. The author and the friend have mutual understanding that they're just friends, and they've never had romantic feelings. Liking the photo is a common social media action, even for friends. But the girlfriend believes that any such interaction with another person of the opposite sex could lead to infidelity, hence considering it cheating.\n\nI need to consider boundaries in relationships. Some people are more sensitive about their partner's interactions with others, especially if they perceive it as flirtatious. However, the author didn't send a message or do anything beyond a like, which is a standard reaction. The friend is aware of the boundaries too. \n\nBut does a like count as cheating? Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. A like is a minor action. However, if it makes the girlfriend uncomfortable and there's a lack of communication about boundaries, maybe the author should reconsider. The author might not be in the wrong in an objective sense, but they might need to address their girlfriend's feelings to maintain trust in the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action crosses a boundary set by the girlfriend. Since the author didn't intend to be flirtatious and both parties have agreed on the friendship, the like itself isn't cheating. But the girlfriend's perception is important in the relationship. The author might not be the asshole, but they should communicate better with their girlfriend about what's acceptable to avoid future issues.\n"
