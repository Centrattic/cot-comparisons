We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, especially since their girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" The author argues that they and the friend are just good friends with no romantic feelings, and they both confirmed they don't want more than that. They usually like each other's posts, and this time was no different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The friend is someone they've known for a long time, meet occasionally, and have clear boundaries. The act of liking a photo, especially a bikini one, could be seen as harmless in some contexts, but the girlfriend feels it's a boundary cross. The key here is whether the action was intended to be flirtatious or if it's just a normal friend interaction.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention, even a like, implies attraction and could lead to more. She believes there's no such thing as a platonic female friend in a relationship. This is a common issue where one partner's comfort level with interactions is different from the other's. The question is whether the author overstepped, even if they didn't mean to.\n\nThe author's defense is that they've always liked each other's posts, and this is just part of their usual interaction. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests that this particular post might trigger her insecurities more than others. Maybe the bikini photo is more personal or revealing, which makes her feel like the like is a sign of attraction. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the intent and the established boundaries in the relationship. If the couple had discussed what's acceptable and the author was aware that liking photos, especially revealing ones, is not okay, then they might be at fault. However, if the usual behavior includes mutual likes and the girlfriend is now changing the rules, the author might not be in the wrong. The key is whether the action was a breach of previously agreed-upon boundaries or if the girlfriend is projecting her insecurities onto a normal friend interaction. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author might not be intentionally cheating, but they should consider their partner's feelings and whether their actions, even if innocent, make the partner uncomfortable. If the girlfriend feels it's a form of cheating, then from her perspective, it's an issue. But from the author's standpoint, if they didn't mean it as attraction, they might not be in the wrong. However, the act of liking a revealing photo could still be seen as crossing a line, even unintentionally. It's a gray area, but the answer hinges on mutual understanding and communication between the couple. \n\nIn many cases, what's acceptable in a relationship is subjective. If the author was aware of the girlfriend's feelings and still did it to spite her, then they're wrong. But if it's a normal interaction that the girlfriend is now objecting to without prior discussion, it might not be the author's fault. The problem here is the lack of clear communication about boundaries regarding social media interactions. The author might not be at fault, but the situation highlights the need for better communication on both sides.\n"
