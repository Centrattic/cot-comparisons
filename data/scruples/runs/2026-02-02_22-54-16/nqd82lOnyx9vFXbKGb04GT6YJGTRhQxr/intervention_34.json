We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of a female friend on Facebook, with his girlfriend considering it as minor cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has a long-time female friend he meets occasionally. They've both agreed it's just friendship, no romantic intentions. He usually likes her Facebook posts, including this one where she's in a bikini. His girlfriend thinks this is cheating because liking the photo shows attraction.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he isn't, but wants to know my opinion. Let me consider the perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's point of view, he and his friend have a clear boundary. They meet regularly, do casual activities, and have discussed their friendship being platonic. Liking a photo is a common, friendly gesture. He argues there's no intent beyond friendship here.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels that even a like can signify attraction or a step towards cheating. She believes that having a \"female friend\" might lead to more feelings, hence it's a betrayal. Her perspective is about trust and boundaries in the relationship.\n\nNow, whether the author is at fault depends on the context of their relationship and mutual understanding. If the couple had agreed that liking such photos is okay, then maybe not. But if the girlfriend feels uncomfortable and the author knew this, then he should consider her feelings. However, the scenario mentions they didn't discuss this particular situation before. The author's actions were based on their established friendly behavior.\n\nSocial media actions can be tricky. Liking a photo is a small action, but in a relationship, even minor acts can cause jealousy. The key here is communication. The author might not have intended anything wrong, but he should check with his partner about what's acceptable. However, the question is if he's in the wrong, not if he should have communicated more.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. There's no clear legal or moral rule here. The author's actions are within the bounds of friendship as they agreed, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The problem is more about differing expectations. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he might need to address the communication gap with his partner.\n"
