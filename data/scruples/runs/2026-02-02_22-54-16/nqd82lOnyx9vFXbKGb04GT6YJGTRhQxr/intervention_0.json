We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and their girlfriend considers it minor cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend and the author have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have made it clear they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts on Facebook. In this case, the friend posted a bikini photo, and the author liked it. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's a form of cheating because liking the photo implies attraction. The author feels the girlfriend is being unfair and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. From the author's viewpoint, they see it as a harmless, platonic interaction. They're maintaining a friendship and engaging as they always do. But the girlfriend's perspective is that the like is a sign of attraction, which could be seen as violating the trust in their relationship. The key here is whether the action breaches the boundaries of the relationship as defined by the girlfriend.\n\nRelationship boundaries can vary. Some people might be okay with liking friends' photos, while others might see it as inappropriate, especially if one partner is uncomfortable. Even if the author and the friend consider their relationship non-romantic, the girlfriend's perception is important here. The author might not have intended to show attraction, but if it causes their partner distress, it's a problem. The question is whether the act of liking a bikini photo, despite the long-standing friendship, crosses a line in this specific relationship.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's argument is that \"female friends\" inevitably lead to more feelings, making the author a cheater. This is a common concern in relationships where friends of the opposite sex are involved. The author's response to that is that their friendship is clearly defined and they don't have those feelings. But the girlfriend's trust is broken by the like. \n\nIt's possible the author isn't in the wrong in terms of intention, but in relationships, actions that don't feel good to the partner can be issues regardless of intent. The act of liking a photo of a friend in a bikini might be perceived as flirtatious or showing appreciation for their appearance, which can be sensitive. The author might need to consider their partner's feelings and adjust their behavior to maintain trust, even if they don't see it as a problem. So, maybe the answer is B (No), because the author didn't intend to cheat, but the girlfriend's perspective is valid in terms of relationship trust. However, the author could be in the wrong if the action is disrespectful to their partner's feelings. It's a bit of a grey area. The important point is that the girlfriend feels wronged, which in AITA scenarios often means the person whose action caused the partner's distress is the asshole. So, perhaps A (Yes) the author is in the wrong because the like, even if innocent, is causing emotional harm and breaking trust. But I need to make sure about the standard in such cases. Usually, if a partner feels a certain action is cheating, even if it's minor, the person doing it can be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer might be A.\n"
