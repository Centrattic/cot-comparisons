We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is a long-time acquaintance they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts, so this isn't an isolated incident. The girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of attraction and calls it \"minor cheating.\"\n\nThe girlfriend's point of view is that there's no such thing as a female friend without romantic feelings developing. She's feeling insecure or threatened by the like. The author feels it's unfair, but the question is whether he's wrong.\n\nNow, the key factors here are consent and boundaries in the relationship. The couple hasn't discussed what actions are considered appropriate. The girlfriend feels the like is a boundary cross, even if the author didn't intend it. In many relationships, actions that make a partner uncomfortable can be considered wrong, even if unintended. The author might not have meant to imply attraction, but the girlfriend's reaction is valid because of her feelings. \n\nHowever, the author's argument is that the friendship is platonic and that liking photos is a common, harmless action. But the girlfriend's interpretation is that it's a form of cheating, which is a serious accusation. The question is whether the author is wrong for not respecting her feelings. \n\nSince the core issue is about how actions affect the partner's sense of security, even if unintended, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective. The answer would depend on the relationship dynamics and communication. If they hadn't discussed boundaries, then the author isn't necessarily wrong, but if the girlfriend's feelings are valid and he's aware, then he might be. The situation is ambiguous, but leaning towards answer B (not in the wrong) because the action was innocent and the couple hadn't set those boundaries. However, some might argue that he should be more considerate of her feelings regardless. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is B because the act itself isn't inherently wrong, but communication is key. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the action was done without malice, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
