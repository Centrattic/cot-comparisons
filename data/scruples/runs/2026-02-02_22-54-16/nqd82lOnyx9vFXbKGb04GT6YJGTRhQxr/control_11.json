We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo, and their girlfriend considers it cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has been friends with this woman for a long time, they meet occasionally, and both have agreed that their relationship is strictly platonic. They often like each other's Facebook posts. The issue arose when the author liked a photo of his friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend interpreted as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friendship is established as non-romantic, mutual agreement on that, and the act of liking a photo. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention from a friend could lead to deeper feelings and thus is cheating. The author, however, feels it's unfair.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. The concept of \"cheating\" can be subjective. Some people might see liking a photo as harmless, others might feel it's crossing a boundary. Since the author and the friend have a clear agreement, but the girlfriend has her own boundaries based on her perception.\n\nThe author might not have intended to show attraction, but actions can be perceived differently. Even if the intention is innocent, if the girlfriend feels hurt and sees it as cheating, then the author might need to consider her feelings. The answer depends on relationship dynamics and communication. However, the question is whether the author is objectively in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, if both partners agree on what constitutes cheating, then the action is wrong if it violates those agreed terms. Since the girlfriend considers it cheating, and the author didn't communicate or agree on such boundaries, the author might be in the wrong from her perspective. So, the answer could be A (Yes). But if the couple didn't discuss boundaries, maybe B (No) because the author didn't intend harm. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid in the context of their relationship. Therefore, it's possible the answer is A.\n"
