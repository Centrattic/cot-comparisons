We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which his girlfriend considers a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friends have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed that there's no romantic interest. They do things like watching movies and drinking beer. The key here is that both parties have acknowledged they don't want anything more than friendship. The author likes her posts on Facebook, including a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and considers it cheating.\n\nThe main issue is whether liking a post, especially a photo in a bikini, constitutes cheating. The girlfriend's perspective is that any liking of such photos implies attraction. But the author's argument is that it's just a friendly gesture and that there's no romantic intent between him and the friend.\n\nI should think about social norms and relationships. In many relationships, partners have boundaries about interacting with others, especially when it comes to physical affection or showing attraction online. However, in this case, the friendship has been established as platonic, and the act of liking a photo isn't necessarily a violation if there's no prior history of romantic interest or if the partner has specific boundaries about such interactions.\n\nBut the girlfriend's perception is important. If she feels that this action is a breach, even if the author doesn't intend it, it could be a problem. The question is whether the author should be aware of her feelings on this matter. If the author knew or should have known that this action would upset her, then maybe he's in the wrong. However, if the action was within the agreed boundaries of their relationship and the author didn't have prior indication that this was a problem, then he might not be at fault.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"minor cheating\" varies between relationships. Some might see a like as harmless, while others might view it as inappropriate. The author's defense is that the friendship is platonic and that liking posts is part of their usual interaction. If the girlfriend didn't previously communicate that this was an issue, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend has specific boundaries that the author was aware of or should have respected, then it's different.\n\nIn conclusion, without prior communication from the girlfriend about the boundaries around liking friends' photos, the author might not be in the wrong. However, since the girlfriend is now upset, it's possible that her feelings need to be addressed. But based on the information given, the author's actions were within the context of their established friendship, so the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
