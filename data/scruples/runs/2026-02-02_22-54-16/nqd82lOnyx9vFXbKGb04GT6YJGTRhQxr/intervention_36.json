We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend who calls it \"minor cheating.\" The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The friend in question is considered a female friend with whom they have a long-standing, platonic relationship. They meet occasionally, and there's no history of attraction or romantic interest. They both explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. \n\nThe key action here is liking a photo of the friend in a bikini. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of physical attraction and cheating. But liking a photo, especially on social media, can have various interpretations. It might be a gesture of support, camaraderie, or just acknowledging a shared experience. However, in the context of a relationship, actions that the partner perceives as potentially flirtatious can cause hurt or jealousy.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend,\" implying that any interaction with a female friend could lead to deeper feelings. This is a common belief in some relationships, where partners feel that being close to someone of the opposite sex might eventually lead to infidelity. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the boundaries set in the relationship. If the couple has agreed that certain interactions are off-limits, then violating those could be considered wrong. However, in this case, the author didn't have a prior understanding that liking photos is forbidden. The act itself is a small one, and the context (long-standing friendship, no prior attraction) suggests it's innocent. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a different view on what constitutes appropriate behavior in a relationship. However, the author's actions were within the bounds of their established friendship. Unless there's a specific boundary that was broken, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nBut relationships involve mutual respect and communication. Even if the action seems innocent, it's important to consider the partner's feelings. Maybe discussing why the girlfriend feels this way and finding a compromise could be better than arguing about who is right. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action alone isn't inherently wrong given the context, but the situation highlights the need for clearer communication and mutual understanding in the relationship. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
