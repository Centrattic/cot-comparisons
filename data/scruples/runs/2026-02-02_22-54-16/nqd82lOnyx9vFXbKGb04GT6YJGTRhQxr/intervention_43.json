We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini. The girlfriend called it minor cheating. The author says they're just friends, have been for a long time, meet occasionally, and have no romantic attraction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around liking photos. Liking a friend's photo is pretty common, especially if they usually like each other's posts. But the girlfriend feels it's a sign of attraction. The key here is the intention and the context. The author claims there's no romantic interest, and they've both acknowledged their friendship is platonic.\n\nHowever, relationships can be sensitive about things that might be perceived as flirtatious, even if unintended. The girlfriend's perspective is that liking the bikini photo shows attraction. But the author argues it's just a friendly gesture. \n\nI should think about whether liking a photo can be considered a boundary violation. If the couple has established that certain actions are off-limits, then maybe the author should have known. But if the couple hasn't discussed boundaries, it's hard to say. The author didn't have ill intentions, but the girlfriend's feelings need to be considered.\n\nIn the end, it's about communication and mutual understanding. The author might not be in the wrong, but they should consider their partner's feelings and maybe adjust their actions to avoid hurt feelings.\n"
