We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a relationship and has a female friend they've known for a long time. They meet occasionally, like once every 1.5 months. They're good friends and have made it clear they don't want anything more than friendship. When they hang out, they do casual things like watch movies, eat, drink, and chat. \n\nThe issue arose when the author liked a photo of their friend in a bikini on Facebook. The girlfriend considers this a form of \"minor cheating,\" arguing that the like indicates attraction and implies the author might have feelings for the friend. The author's girlfriend believes that having a \"female friend\" is risky because one might develop deeper feelings, leading to cheating. The author, on the other hand, feels this is unfair and is seeking whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the nature of the relationship between the author and their friend. They've known each other a long time, meet occasionally, and have clearly stated they don't want anything romantic. The friend posted a photo, and the author liked it. Liking a photo is a common social media action, often just a sign of appreciation or friendliness. However, the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of attraction. \n\nThe key here is whether the action of liking a photo in a bikini is a breach of the relationship's boundaries. The author might not have intended it that way, but the girlfriend feels hurt. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is crucial. If the girlfriend has concerns about the author's interactions with friends, especially female ones, she should have addressed that earlier. If the author was aware that their actions could cause discomfort, they might need to consider their partner's feelings. However, if the girlfriend didn't previously express discomfort with liking photos or interacting with friends in such a way, maybe the author isn't at fault.\n\nAnother angle: the author and their friend have a clear understanding that their relationship is platonic. The act of liking a photo doesn't inherently imply romantic interest, especially if they often like each other's posts. The girlfriend's interpretation seems to be projecting her insecurities onto the situation. That doesn't make the author right, but it's more about the girlfriend's insecurity rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend feels that liking that specific photo is a problem, even if the author didn't intend it, the author should probably consider their partner's feelings and perhaps avoid liking photos that could be misinterpreted. But if the author didn't know that was an issue, is it their fault?\n\nIn many cases, it's not about right or wrong but about communication. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't intend harm, but they might need to adjust their behavior to respect their partner's feelings. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. Liking a photo isn't a physical act of cheating. It's more about emotional boundaries. If the couple hasn't discussed what is acceptable in terms of social media interactions, both parties might have different expectations.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action alone isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's interpretation is based on her perception and insecurities. The author isn't cheating, but they should communicate with their partner to understand why this is a problem and find a middle ground. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, it's important for them to address the communication gap with their partner.\n"
