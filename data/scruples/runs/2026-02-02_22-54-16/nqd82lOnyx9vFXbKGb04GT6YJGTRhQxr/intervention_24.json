We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, and his girlfriend is calling it cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he and his friend have been friends for a long time, and they're clear that they don't want anything more than friendship. They meet occasionally, and they usually like each other's posts. The specific instance was liking a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the boundaries they've set. The author and his friend have communicated that their relationship is strictly platonic. Liking a photo is a common social media interaction. But the girlfriend feels it's a breach because she doesn't trust that the boundaries are enough. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. From his side, he's maintaining a friendship and engaging in normal social behavior. But from the girlfriend's perspective, if she's uncomfortable with any form of attention from his friend, even a like could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe issue might be about trust and communication. If the author and his girlfriend haven't discussed what's acceptable in terms of social media interactions, the girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity. However, the author isn't doing anything that was previously agreed upon as inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's belief that there's no such thing as a female friend might be influencing her perception. That could be a personal insecurity rather than a valid accusation of cheating. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is at fault. Since he followed their established boundaries and the action itself (liking a photo) isn't inherently disrespectful or deceitful, I think the answer would lean towards B, that he's not in the wrong. However, the situation could require more communication to address the girlfriend's concerns.\n"
