We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as their girlfriend considers it a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend is a long-time friend, and they've both agreed that they don't want more than a friendship. They occasionally meet up for casual activities. The user likes her Facebook posts, including a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and considers it cheating.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether liking a friend's photo, especially in a bikini, constitutes cheating. The girlfriend's perspective is that any liking behavior towards a female friend is a betrayal. The user argues that they're just friends and there's no attraction.\n\nCheating typically involves engaging in romantic or sexual activities with someone other than one's partner. Liking a photo is a public endorsement or appreciation, but it's not a physical act. However, in relationships, boundaries can be very personal. Even if there's no explicit rule, some people might feel uncomfortable if their partner interacts with others in certain ways, even digitally.\n\nThe user's actions might not be cheating in the traditional sense, but they could be overstepping emotional boundaries if the partner perceives it as a sign of interest. The fact that the girlfriend feels it's cheating suggests that there's an unspoken boundary that the user didn't consider. The user might need to respect their partner's feelings, even if they don't understand why.\n\nOn the other hand, the user maintains that there's no attraction and that the friendship is platonic. If that's true, then the act of liking a photo shouldn't be a problem. But since the partner is hurt, the user's actions might still be causing emotional distress, which can be a form of relational harm, even if it's not physical cheating.\n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. The user might not be wrong in terms of actual cheating, but they could be wrong in not acknowledging their partner's feelings and boundaries. Communication is key here. The user should talk to their girlfriend to understand why this upsets her and set clearer boundaries to avoid future issues. So, the answer isn't a clear A or B, but since the user is asking for a yes/no, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the action itself isn't cheating, but the girlfriend's perspective is valid and needs to be addressed through discussion.\n"
