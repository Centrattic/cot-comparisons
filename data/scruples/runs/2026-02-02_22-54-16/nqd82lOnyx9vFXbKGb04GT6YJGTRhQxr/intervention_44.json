We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by liking a friend's bikini photo, and the girlfriend considered it as minor cheating. The author argues that they've known this friend for a long time, they're just friends, and there's no attraction. The girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and the friend are just friends, and they've made that clear to each other. They meet occasionally and have a platonic relationship. The act in question is a Facebook like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend feels it's a boundary crossed, but the author doesn't see it that way.\n\nNow, in terms of cheating definitions, typically it involves a breach of trust or emotional/physical infidelity. Liking a photo isn't a physical act, but the girlfriend's perception is that it's a sign of attraction. However, the author's intent was just to acknowledge the friend's post, as they often do. The key here is whether the action was intended to be flirtatious or not. Since the friend is a long-time platonic friend, and the author didn't have any romantic intentions, the action itself might not be malicious.\n\nBut the girlfriend's feelings are valid. If she feels hurt and sees it as cheating, even if the author didn't mean it that way, it's a communication issue. The author might need to be more mindful of how their actions are perceived, especially in a committed relationship. Even if the author isn't in the wrong from their own perspective, the impact on the girlfriend is important. So, the answer might hinge on whether the action was a mistake in the context of the relationship dynamics.\n\nIn some relationships, certain boundaries are agreed upon, and crossing them can be seen as wrong, regardless of intent. The author's girlfriend might have set a boundary that liking such photos is off-limits. If that's the case, the author went against her boundaries, which could make them at fault, even if unintentionally. On the other hand, if the author was unaware of that boundary, it's more about communication. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't know, but the situation shows a lack of awareness about the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (No) because the author didn't have malicious intent and the relationship with the friend is platonic. However, the author should consider the girlfriend's feelings and adjust their behavior to respect her boundaries. It's a matter of communication and mutual understanding rather than a clear-cut wrong.\n"
