We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend considers minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and the female friend have been friends a long time, meet occasionally, and have made it clear they don't want anything romantic. They often like each other's posts on Facebook. The friend posted a bikini photo, and the author liked it. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions of the author and the girlfriend's perspective. The author claims there's no romantic intent, just friendly interaction. But the girlfriend feels it's a violation because she doesn't believe in \"just friends\" relationships, thinking one will eventually develop feelings. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are crucial. The author didn't have malicious intent, but the action made the girlfriend feel insecure. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. However, whether the author is \"in the wrong\" depends on whether the action crossed a boundary the girlfriend had set. \n\nIf the couple hadn't discussed boundaries around social media interactions before, the author might not be entirely at fault. But if the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with liking such photos, then the author would be wrong. Since the scenario doesn't mention prior discussion, it's more about the girlfriend's interpretation. \n\nIn many relationships, what one person sees as innocent, another might find hurtful. The fact that the author and the friend have clear boundaries between them complicates things. The author isn't engaging in anything beyond friendship, but the girlfriend's insecurity leads her to perceive it as cheating. \n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. However, since the author didn't act with malicious intent and there's no prior indication that this specific action was off-limits, the author might not be in the wrong. The issue here is more about the girlfriend's perception and the need for better communication between the couple about boundaries and insecurities.\n"
