We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of their female friend in a bikini. The girlfriend considers this as minor cheating. \n\nFirst, the background: They're friends who've known each other for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. The author likes her Facebook posts, including one where she's in a bikini. The girlfriend feels this is a sign of physical attraction and cheating.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, it's important to consider the girlfriend's perspective. In relationships, boundaries can vary. What one person sees as harmless, another might find offensive. The key here is communication. The friends had agreed they don't want anything more than friendship, so the act of liking the photo might not come from attraction, but the girlfriend might see it as a violation of trust or emotional boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, liking photos is a common social behavior. If there's no history of jealousy or previous issues, the author might not realize how the action is perceived. However, in a trusting relationship, both partners should discuss such concerns to align expectations. The author might not be intentionally wrong, but if the action causes hurt, they might need to adjust their behavior out of respect.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the relationship dynamics. If the girlfriend feels it's a breach of trust, the author might need to reconsider their actions to maintain the relationship. But it's not necessarily a clear-cut case of being wrong; it's more about differing expectations and communication.\n"
