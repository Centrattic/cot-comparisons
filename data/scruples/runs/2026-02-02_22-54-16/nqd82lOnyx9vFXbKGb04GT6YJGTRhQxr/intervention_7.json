We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about liking a female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and the girlfriend considers that \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The man has a long-time female friend, and they're just friends. They've clarified that there's no attraction. They meet occasionally and do normal friend stuff. He likes her posts on Facebook, including a bikini photo. The girlfriend feels that liking the photo indicates attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he's just liking a photo as a friend, which is a common social media action. He and the friend have agreed they're just friends, so there's no intent to be inappropriate. On the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she interprets the like as a sign of attraction. In relationships, trust and communication are important. If the girlfriend feels this way, maybe the author should have been more cautious with his actions, even if he didn't mean anything by it.\n\nBut does liking a photo count as cheating? Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. A like is a minor action, but it can be a point of contention if one partner is uncomfortable. The girlfriend's perspective is that any sign of attraction to someone else is cheating, which is a strict view. The author's argument is that it's just a friendly action, and they're not interested in anything more.\n\nThe key here is whether the action itself is inherently wrong or if it's about the girlfriend's perception. Since they're in a committed relationship, the author should consider his partner's feelings. Even if his intention was innocent, if it causes her distress, maybe he should avoid actions that could be misinterpreted. However, social media interactions are common, and expecting a partner to avoid all such interactions might be unrealistic unless there's a specific agreement in place.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he might need to address his girlfriend's insecurities. The answer depends on the relationship's dynamics. If the girlfriend has previously communicated that such actions are a deal-breaker, then maybe he should have refrained. But without prior discussion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intent was innocent, but the impact on his girlfriend is real. However, whether it's a justified perception is subjective.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong in terms of actual action, but there's a need for better communication between the couple. The answer should be B (No).\n"
