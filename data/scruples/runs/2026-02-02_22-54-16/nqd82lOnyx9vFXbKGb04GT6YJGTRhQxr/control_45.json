We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user liked a photo of their female friend on Facebook where she was in a bikini. Their girlfriend considers that a \"minor cheating.\" The user says they have a long-term friendship, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more. They usually like each other's posts, but this time it's about a bikini photo.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She might feel that liking a bikini photo is a sign of attraction or flirtation, even if it's not intended that way. In relationships, boundaries can be subjective. What one person sees as a harmless like, the other might interpret as crossing a line. The girlfriend's belief is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without potential for deeper feelings. That's a common insecurity, maybe stemming from past experiences or a need for reassurance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they have a clear agreement with the friend about staying just friends and that liking posts is a normal part of their interaction. They didn't have any other inappropriate behavior. However, the act of liking a bikini photo could be seen as giving unnecessary attention to her body, which might not align with the girlfriend's comfort level. Even if it's a platonic relationship, the girlfriend's perception matters in the relationship dynamics.\n\nIt's also important to consider cultural or personal norms. Some people are more sensitive to such actions. The key here is communication. The author might not have intended to hurt, but they didn't consider how their action could be perceived. Even if it's a small thing, if it's causing distress, it's worth addressing. The girlfriend's reaction, while maybe over-the-top to some, isn't entirely unreasonable if she's feeling insecure.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The action itself is minor, but if it's causing harm or discomfort in the relationship, the author should be aware and adjust their behavior. The fact that the girlfriend brought it up suggests it's a deal-breaker for her. The author might not have malicious intent, but they should respect her feelings. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes), because even if it's not a major infraction, the action caused harm, and the author should have been more mindful of how it could be perceived. Alternatively, if the author had no intent and the girlfriend is being overly sensitive, it could be B (No). But given that the girlfriend feels it's a form of cheating, and the author's actions, while not malicious, contributed to that feeling, the author might share some responsibility. So leaning towards A.\n"
