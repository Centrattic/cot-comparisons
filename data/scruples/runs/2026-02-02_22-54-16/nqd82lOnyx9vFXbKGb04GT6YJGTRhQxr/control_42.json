We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo, as their girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a long-time female friend they consider platonic. They occasionally meet up, do regular hangout things, and both have explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The issue arose when the author liked a photo of the friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend interpreted as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nSo, the main question is whether liking a photo, especially with a bikini, constitutes cheating. The girlfriend believes there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without some romantic feelings, implying that any positive interaction might be a step towards infidelity. The author feels this is unfair since they have a clear understanding with their friend and that liking the photo is just a friendly gesture.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and relationship boundaries. In some relationships, even minor interactions with the opposite sex that are perceived as flirtatious can cause jealousy. However, the key here is intent. The author didn't comment or message; they just liked the photo. They also have a history of liking each other's posts, which could be part of their normal interaction. The fact that they've both agreed on a platonic relationship might suggest that the author isn't in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's feelings and interpretation are valid in the context of trust and communication.\n\nIf the girlfriend's insecurity is based on the belief that liking a photo shows attraction, it's more about her perception than the act itself. But the author should consider whether their actions could be misinterpreted, even if unintended. The line between friendly and flirting can be blurry.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author and friend have always been clear about their boundaries, then the like might not be a betrayal. However, in relationships, sometimes partners have specific boundaries that others might find trivial. The question is whether the author should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings, even if he didn't intend anything more.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context of their relationship's boundaries. If the girlfriend expressed discomfort before about liking photos, then the author might be wrong. But if this was the first time and the like didn't involve any additional interaction, maybe not. However, since the girlfriend is using this as a form of cheating, the author's action, while innocent, might have crossed a line she set without prior discussion. Therefore, the answer might hinge on whether the author should have respected her unspoken boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action, from the girlfriend's perspective, caused a breach of trust. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the action was neutral, but the girlfriend's perception is valid. However, if the relationship norms require avoiding any possible misinterpretation, then maybe A. But given the information, B seems more plausible.\n"
