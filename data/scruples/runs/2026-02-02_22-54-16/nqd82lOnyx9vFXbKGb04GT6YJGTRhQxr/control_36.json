We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who liked their friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend who calls it \"minor cheating.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is a long-time female friend they see occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts. The girlfriend feels that liking the bikini photo shows attraction, which is a problem.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship between the author and the friend, the girlfriend's perspective, and social norms. The author argues it's just a friendly like, but the girlfriend sees it as a boundary crossed. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend might feel insecure or see the like as a sign of interest. Even if the author's intention was neutral, actions can be perceived differently. The fact that they agreed on just being friends suggests mutual understanding, but the act of liking a revealing photo might not align with the girlfriend's expectations.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is important. If they genuinely don't have feelings and the like was just friendly, maybe it's not malicious. But the girlfriend's reaction indicates that it's causing hurt. The question is whether the action breaches the trust or boundaries of the relationship.\n\nIt's possible that the girlfriend is overreacting, but her feelings are valid. The author might need to consider her perspective and adjust their behavior to respect her feelings, even if they don't see it as cheating. The answer hinges on whether the action violates the relationship's boundaries, which the girlfriend believes it does.\n"
