We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, and their girlfriend called it minor cheating. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been friends a long time, meet occasionally, and have clarified they don't want more than friendship. The friend posted a bikini photo, and the author liked it. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it shows attraction. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nLiking a photo is a common social media action. Friends often like each other's posts. The key here is the nature of their relationship. They both agreed it's just friendship. But the girlfriend perceives it as cheating. Is the author in the wrong?\n\nWell, the author didn't have any intention beyond friendship. They like other posts too. The girlfriend's interpretation is that a like equals attraction. But intentions matter, right? If the author's action was within the bounds of a friendship they both acknowledge, maybe it's not wrong. However, if the girlfriend feels uncomfortable, maybe the author should consider her feelings. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the author didn't cross any boundaries they mutually agreed on, then B (No). If the girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's action was neutral, then maybe B. But if the action is seen as inappropriate by the girlfriend, even if the author didn't mean it, does that make them the asshole? Not sure. It's a bit about perspective. The author might not be in the wrong, but maybe the relationship dynamics mean they should be more cautious. But the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether liking a photo in this context is considered a breach of their agreed-upon friendship. Since they both said they don't want more, and the author's actions are consistent with that, I think B is the right answer.\n"
