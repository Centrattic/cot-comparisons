We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as his girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" The situation involves long-term friends who have clearly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They occasionally meet up, and they usually like each other's Facebook posts. The issue here is liking a specific photo where the friend is in a bikini.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and the friend have a clear boundary: they're just friends with no romantic intent. Liking a photo is a common social media interaction. But the girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction, which the author didn't intend. The key here is the girlfriend's perspective and how actions can be perceived differently.\n\nThe concept of \"minor cheating\" might refer to emotional infidelity, which varies between relationships. Some people might see liking a photo as harmless, while others might find it crossing a boundary. Since the girlfriend feels this is cheating, the author's actions, though unintentional, have caused emotional distress. The author's responsibility here is to respect their partner's feelings and boundaries. Even if the action was innocent, if it makes the partner uncomfortable, it's important to address it and avoid repeating it. \n\nHowever, the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a strict sense. The problem arises from the girlfriend's interpretation and the lack of communication about social media boundaries. But since relationships are about mutual respect, the author should consider their partner's feelings. The answer hinges on whether intent matters more than the action's perception. In this case, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because there was no malicious intent, but also A if the action is seen as disregarding the partner's feelings. Wait, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the action was a like on a photo, and the girlfriend is upset, the author isn't necessarily wrong, but they need to communicate better. So probably B.\n"
