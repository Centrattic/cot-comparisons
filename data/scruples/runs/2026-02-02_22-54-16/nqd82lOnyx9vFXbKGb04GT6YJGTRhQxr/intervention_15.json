We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong. The girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The person has a long-time female friend they see occasionally. They both have no romantic or physical attraction, and they've explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts on Facebook. In this case, the friend posted a bikini photo, and the person liked it. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and considers it cheating.\n\nThe main question is whether the action of liking the photo is wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants opinions. \n\nI need to consider the girlfriend's perspective first. If she feels that liking the photo is a form of cheating, that's a significant emotional reaction. In relationships, boundaries are crucial, and they vary between couples. Some might see liking a friend's photo as harmless, while others might find it crossing a line. The girlfriend's belief that a \"female friend\" inevitably leads to one party developing stronger feelings and leading to cheating is a key point here.\n\nFrom the author's side, they claim there's no attraction and that the like is just a habitual action they've done with other posts. But does that matter? The issue here isn't just their intention but also the perception and impact on their partner. Even if the author doesn't mean anything by it, the girlfriend's insecurity or interpretation could be valid in the context of their relationship. Trust and communication are essential. If the author hasn't discussed this boundary with the girlfriend before, maybe that's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that liking a photo is a common, non-romantic gesture. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests that this particular like, on a bikini photo, is different. It's possible she feels it's a violation of the unspoken rule of not engaging with someone else in a way that could imply attraction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the agreed-upon boundaries in their relationship. If the girlfriend explicitly communicates that such likes make her uncomfortable and the author continues to do it, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if there was no prior discussion about this, maybe the author isn't intentionally violating a boundary. The question is whether the action itself is wrong or if it's about the girlfriend's feelings about it. \n\nIn many cases, actions that make a partner feel insecure can be seen as harmful, even if the action is technically innocent. The author might need to consider their girlfriend's feelings more and adjust their behavior to respect her boundaries. But if there was no prior agreement, the author might not be at fault. However, the girlfriend's perspective is important here. \n\nI think the answer hinges on mutual understanding and communication. If the author didn't know that liking the photo was an issue, maybe they aren't in the wrong, but they should be more mindful of the girlfriend's feelings. However, if the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with such likes, then the author would be in the wrong. Since the user didn't mention prior communication, I have to assume it's the first time the girlfriend raised this. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong, but they should address it to avoid future issues. Still, the girlfriend's reaction could be valid if she interprets the like as a sign of attraction. \n\nLooking for similar situations: In some relationship advice contexts, it's suggested that even small actions that a partner perceives as cheating should be taken seriously because relationships are about trust and respecting each other's feelings. So, even if the author's intention is innocent, the girlfriend's perception is key here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's feelings and maintaining the right boundaries. \n\nBut wait, the user's friend is a woman, and they're in a relationship. The act of liking a friend's photo, especially a revealing one, might be seen as inappropriate regardless of intent. The girlfriend's priority is her own feelings and the trust in the relationship. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the girlfriend perceives it as cheating, and in a relationship, respecting the partner's comfort level is important. However, the author might not have been aware of that boundary, so it's a communication issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just about communication. If the girlfriend's claim is that any like on a friend's photo is a form of cheating, that might be an overreaction. However, the specific context of a bikini photo adds another layer. The friend is in a bikini, which is more revealing than usual, so the like could be interpreted as a sign of attraction. The author's defense is that they don't have romantic feelings, but the girlfriend might not feel reassured by that. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) if there's no prior agreement or if the action is common between friends. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid as it's about her feelings. But the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually considers the perceived wrongness. The girlfriend's POW (point of view) is that the like constitutes cheating, so the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries, even if unintentionally. So maybe answer A. \n\nWait, but the like was a standard action. If the author and girlfriend aren't in agreement about boundaries, the problem is more about communication. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend is in the right to set boundaries, then the author's action, while not malicious, could be seen as violating those boundaries. So the answer might be A. But I need to check if liking a photo is a form of cheating. Typically, cheating involves betrayal, but this is a gray area. If the girlfriend defines it as cheating, then within their relationship, the author's action breaches that. So the answer is A.\n"
