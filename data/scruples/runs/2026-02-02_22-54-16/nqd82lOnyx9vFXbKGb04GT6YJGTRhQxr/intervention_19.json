We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he liked a photo of his female friend wearing a bikini on Facebook. His girlfriend called this \"minor cheating.\" The key points are that they've been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The author usually likes her posts, and this was just one instance.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo implies attraction and could lead to more feelings, making him a cheater. The author feels this is unfair. The question is whether he's the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author and the friend have clear boundaries: they agree it's just friendship. He didn't comment or engage beyond a like, which is a common action on social media. However, the girlfriend might view even a like as a boundary cross, especially if she's uncomfortable with it. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might have insecurities or specific expectations about how her partner interacts with others. But the author didn't do anything that goes beyond the agreed-upon friendship. Liking a photo isn't inherently flirtatious, especially if they already have a pattern of liking each other's posts. \n\nHowever, some people might interpret a like on a revealing photo as a sign of attraction, even if unintended. The author's friend might also perceive it that way, but there's no indication that the friend took it as a romantic gesture. The main issue is the girlfriend's interpretation. \n\nCheating typically involves emotional or physical infidelity. Liking a photo doesn't fall into those categories unless there's a prior agreement that such actions are off-limits. Since the couple didn't discuss this specific behavior, the girlfriend's take could be her own insecurity or a subjective view, not necessarily an objective wrong of the author. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation points to a need for better communication between the couple. The girlfriend's reaction is valid in terms of her feelings, but the act itself isn't cheating unless they both agree that it is. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation shows a miscommunication.\n"
