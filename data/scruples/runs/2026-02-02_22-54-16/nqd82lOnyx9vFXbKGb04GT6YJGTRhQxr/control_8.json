We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and their girlfriend considers it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says they've known this friend for a long time, meet up occasionally, and both have agreed they're just friends, no physical attraction. They like each other's posts on Facebook, and this time it was a bikini photo. The girlfriend thinks it's cheating because liking the photo shows attraction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider social norms around relationships and boundaries. In relationships, partners often have different comfort levels regarding interactions with others. Some people might find any form of attention to the opposite sex as crossing a line, even if it's just a like. Others might see it as harmless if there's no deeper intent.\n\nThe author claims there's no attraction and it's just friendly interaction. But the girlfriend feels it's a betrayal. So, the core of it is about the girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, their action still caused a problem in the relationship. In relationships, respecting partner's feelings is important. If the girlfriend sees it as cheating, even if the author doesn't, maybe the author should reconsider their actions to maintain trust and avoid hurt feelings. \n\nBut also, the fact that they agreed they're just friends and no attraction, so maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. But the author's action of liking a bikini photo could be seen as showing appreciation of the body, which might be a step beyond friendship for some people.\n\nIn some contexts, liking a photo of someone in a bikini could be a normal friend interaction, but for others, it's a red flag. The key here is about the girlfriend's POV. Since she's calling it cheating, and the author's action led to conflict, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their action affects the partner, even if it's unintentional. So, answer A. But if the author's intention was purely friendly, then maybe not. But in relationships, intentions don't always matter as much as the impact. So, A.\n"
