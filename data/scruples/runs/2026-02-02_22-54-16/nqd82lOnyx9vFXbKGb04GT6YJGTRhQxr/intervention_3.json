We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of a female friend on Facebook. The girlfriend called it minor cheating. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a long-time female friend they meet occasionally, once every 1.5 months. They're good friends and have explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. When they hang out, it's just casual stuff like watching movies, eating, and chatting. They usually like each other's Facebook posts. This particular time, the friend posted a bikini photo from a beach, and the author liked it. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants the assistant's opinion.\n\nI need to consider the perspectives here. From the author's POV, they see it as a friendly gesture, just liking a photo. They've had clear boundaries set with the friend. The girlfriend, however, feels it's a step towards cheating, implying that any form of liking a friend's photo could be a sign of attraction. \n\nSo, is liking a photo inherently about attraction? Not necessarily. People can like photos for various reasons: the location, the time of the photo, the friend's expression, the scenery, etc. But the girlfriend might interpret it as a sign of interest. The key here is communication and mutual understanding in the relationship. If the girlfriend feels that this action breaches trust or the boundaries of the relationship, then the author might need to acknowledge her feelings. However, if the author believes it's just a friendly like and the friend isn't interested in a romantic relationship, then it's a matter of differing perceptions.\n\nAnother angle is the definition of cheating. Traditionally, cheating involves physical or emotional infidelity. Liking a photo might not be physical, but the girlfriend sees it as emotional. The author might have to consider if such actions, even if intended as friendly, can be perceived as crossing lines in the context of their relationship. The fact that they've had this open conversation with the friend that they don't want anything more could be a point. But the girlfriend might not feel that it's enough, especially if she's uncomfortable with the dynamic. \n\nIt's also about respect in the relationship. If the girlfriend is upset, the author should be empathetic and maybe avoid actions that cause her distress, even if they don't see it as cheating. But is the author in the wrong? It depends on the relationship's boundaries. If the couple hasn't discussed what constitutes appropriate interaction with friends, the author's action might not be the issue, but the lack of communication could be. \n\nThe girlfriend's power of words (POW) is that she believes there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without romantic feelings, implying that all such relationships will eventually lead to cheating. That's a bit extreme and might stem from insecurity. The author's argument is that they have a clear boundary with the friend, and the like is just a friendly action. \n\nIn terms of social norms, a like on a photo isn't typically seen as cheating, but in the context of the relationship, it's about perception and agreements between the couple. If the couple hasn't established clear social media boundaries, the author might not be in the wrong, but they could be at fault for not considering their partner's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the action itself is wrong or if the girlfriend's reaction is just a matter of her personal feelings. The author may not be in the wrong, but there's a need for better communication and understanding between both partners. The action isn't inherently cheating, but if it causes harm, the author might need to adjust to maintain their relationship.\n"
