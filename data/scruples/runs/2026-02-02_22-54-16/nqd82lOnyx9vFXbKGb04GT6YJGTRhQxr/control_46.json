We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong. The girlfriend called it minor cheating. The context is that they've been friends a long time, meet occasionally, and both agree they don't want anything more than friendship. The person's girlfriend thinks liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nHmm. So, the question is about whether liking a photo crosses a boundary in the relationship. The user's argument is that they're just friends, and they both agree. The girlfriend's perspective is that any sign of attraction is cheating. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the person didn't have romantic intentions and the friend is clearly within the boundaries they've set. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels insecure and sees it as a betrayal. The key here is the girlfriend's feelings. Even if the action itself seems harmless, if it's causing hurt, does that make the person in the wrong?\n\nBut wait, the person didn't have any intention beyond friendship, and the act of liking a photo is common. However, maybe the girlfriend has specific boundaries that the person didn't consider. Maybe they should have been more aware of the girlfriend's feelings and avoided actions that could be misinterpreted. \n\nBut the person and the friend have clarified their friendship, so maybe the action isn't wrong. However, relationships require considering the other person's comfort. If the girlfriend views it as cheating, even if it's not the person's intent, maybe they should respect that boundary. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action was a breach of trust for the girlfriend. The person might not be in the wrong if they had no malicious intent, but they might need to adjust their behavior to respect their partner's feelings. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the girlfriend perceives it as cheating, then maybe the person is in the wrong for not considering that. But if the action was innocent, maybe not. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The person's actions were innocent, but the girlfriend's feelings matter. In relationships, communication is key. If the person had discussed the boundaries beforehand, they might have known. Since they didn't, maybe they're in the wrong for not being considerate enough. But if the action is just a like, maybe it's too trivial. \n\nWait, the girlfriend's perspective is that any sign of attraction is cheating. That's a strict view, but in some relationships, people have such boundaries. So if the person knew that, they should avoid actions that trigger that. If they didn't know, then maybe it's a learning point. But since the girlfriend is now upset, maybe the person is in the wrong for not anticipating that. \n\nAlternatively, if the relationship's foundation is trust, and the person had no intention, maybe it's not their fault. It's a bit of a gray area. But the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (no), because the person didn't have malicious intent, and the action was within the bounds of their friendship. However, they might need to be more considerate in the future. But according to the question, the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The answer is B because the act itself isn't inherently wrong, but the girlfriend's feelings are important. However, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong if they had no intent. So B.\n"
