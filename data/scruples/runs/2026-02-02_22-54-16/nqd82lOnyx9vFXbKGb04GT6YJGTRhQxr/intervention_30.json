We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of a female friend. The girlfriend considers it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friends have a long-standing, platonic relationship. They hang out occasionally, do normal friend things. The author and the friend have both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The issue here is the Facebook like on a bikini photo.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo implies attraction, which she sees as cheating. The author thinks it's unfair because it's just a friend. \n\nNow, in relationships, boundaries and trust are key. The girlfriend feels that liking the photo is a sign of attraction, even if the author doesn't intend it that way. But the question is whether the author is actually in the wrong. \n\nThe author didn't have any romantic intent, and the friendship is well-established. Liking a photo is a common, non-romantic gesture. The friend might have posted it to share a moment, not to flirt. The author's action alone doesn't necessarily indicate cheating. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. If the couple hasn't discussed boundaries around social media interactions, this could be a point of contention. Cheating typically involves betrayal, but this seems more about a lack of understanding or communication. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or explicitly against their agreement. The girlfriend's interpretation is based on her perception of the like as a sign of attraction. But attraction doesn't always mean cheating intent, especially if both parties are clear about their non-romantic intentions. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's feelings matter, the author's action alone doesn't equate to cheating. The issue might be more about communication and setting boundaries rather than the act itself. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
