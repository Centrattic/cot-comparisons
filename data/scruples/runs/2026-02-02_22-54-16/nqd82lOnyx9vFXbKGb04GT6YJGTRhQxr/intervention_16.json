We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about liking a female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and the girlfriend considers it cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context. The author has a long-time female friend they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed it's just a friendship with no romantic interest. They like each other's posts on Facebook, and in this case, the author liked a bikini photo. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants opinions. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the nature of the friendship, mutual understanding of platonic boundaries, and the girlfriend's perspective. The author claims there's no romantic intent and that liking the photo is just part of their usual interaction. However, the girlfriend feels it's a sign of cheating because she doesn't believe in purely platonic relationships, as per her POV.\n\nIn relationships, perceptions matter. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, if the action causes hurt or insecurity in the partner, it's a problem. Liking a bikini photo could be seen as a form of attention that's more than just friendship, especially if it's public. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or a lack of trust, but that doesn't automatically make the author in the wrong. However, if the author knew that this action would upset their girlfriend and continued anyway, that could be a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, communication is key. The author might not have realized the impact of their action. But since the girlfriend is now upset, the author should consider her feelings, even if their intention was innocent. So, while the author might not have intended to cheat, the act could be perceived as crossing a boundary in the relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A, but I need to check if there's a consensus on such actions. Some might argue that a like is just a like, but others, especially in a trusting relationship, might see it as inappropriate. Since the girlfriend is the one who's upset and the author's action could be seen as not respecting the partner's feelings, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's perspective, even if unintentionally.\n"
