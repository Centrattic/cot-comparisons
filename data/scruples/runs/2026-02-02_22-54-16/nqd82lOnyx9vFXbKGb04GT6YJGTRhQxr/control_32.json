We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by liking a photo of his female friend wearing a bikini on Facebook. His girlfriend thinks it's a form of cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is someone he's known for a long time, and they meet occasionally. They've both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts. The friend went on a trip, posted a bikini photo, and he liked it. The girlfriend feels this is cheating because it shows attraction.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries in relationships and what constitutes cheating. Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. Liking a photo is a public social media action. But the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of attraction, which he denies. \n\nSince they have a mutual understanding that they're just friends, and he didn't have malicious intent, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if his girlfriend feels hurt and sees it as a breach of trust, even if unintentional, there's a need to consider her feelings. \n\nBut traditionally, liking a photo isn't considered cheating. It's a minor action. The problem might stem from the girlfriend's insecurity rather than the act itself. Unless there's a prior agreement that certain actions are off-limits, the author's action might not be wrong. However, communication between the couple is important here. The author should probably talk to his girlfriend to understand her perspective better and set clearer boundaries if needed.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with a note that communication is key. The act itself isn't cheating, but the girlfriend's feelings matter, so the author should address that.\n"
