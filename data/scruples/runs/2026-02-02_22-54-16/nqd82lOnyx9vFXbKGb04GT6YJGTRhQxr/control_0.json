We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of a female friend, and the girlfriend called it minor cheating. The situation involves a long-time female friend they occasionally meet, and they've both clarified they don't want anything more than friendship. The girlfriend is upset because the like is seen as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships. Liking a photo on social media is a common action, but context matters. The friend in question is a woman the person has known for a long time, and they've established boundaries. The girlfriend's perspective is that even a like could indicate attraction, which they perceive as cheating. \n\nBut is a like enough to be considered cheating? Cheating usually involves a breach of trust or intimacy. A like might be seen as a harmless action, but if the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of attraction, it becomes a matter of trust and communication. The key here is the girlfriend's feelings and how the action affects the relationship. \n\nThe author might not have intended anything, but if the girlfriend feels hurt or betrayed, the issue isn't just the like itself but how it's making her feel. The author should consider their girlfriend's perspective and the importance of respecting her boundaries, even if the action seems trivial. \n\nHowever, the author also mentions they've been clear about the friendship, so they might not be in the wrong. But relationships require both parties to communicate and understand each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with any likes, maybe the author should avoid that to respect her feelings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a gray area. If the action was done without malice and the author didn't have ill intent, but the girlfriend is upset, maybe it's not the author's fault. However, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author's action caused hurt, even unintentionally, the author might need to adjust their behavior. The answer depends on whether the action crossed a boundary the girlfriend set, which the author might not have been aware of. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but they should address the issue to maintain trust.\n"
