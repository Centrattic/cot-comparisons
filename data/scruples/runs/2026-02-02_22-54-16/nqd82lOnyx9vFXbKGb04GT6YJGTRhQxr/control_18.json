We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as the girlfriend considers it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is described as a long-time friend they meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They like each other's posts on Facebook regularly. The specific instance was liking a bikini photo, which the girlfriend interprets as a sign of attraction or cheating.\n\nNow, the key points here are the nature of their relationship with the friend and the girlfriend's perspective. The author argues that there's no romantic intent, but the girlfriend feels it's a violation because she doesn't believe in \"just friends\" when there's a gender difference. \n\nCheating definitions can vary, but typically involve emotional or physical infidelity. Liking a photo is a public action that doesn't necessarily indicate a romantic interest, especially if they've established boundaries with the friend. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because she perceives it as a breach of trust. \n\nThe author isn't intentionally being disloyal, but the action might be seen as careless if it causes distress. The question is whether the act itself is wrong. Since there's no explicit agreement about social media interactions, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation highlights a miscommunication about boundaries. The girlfriend's perception is important here; if she feels cheated, then the author's action, though not malicious, could be considered wrong in her eyes. However, objectively, without prior agreement to avoid such likes, the author isn't necessarily at fault. So the answer leans towards B (No), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
