We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, with their girlfriend considering it as \"minor cheating.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person has a female friend they've known for a long time, meeting occasionally. They both agree they don't want anything more than friendship. The friend posted a photo in a bikini, and the person liked it. The girlfriend feels this is cheating because it shows attraction.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship between the person and their friend. Both have explicitly stated they only want to be friends. The act of liking a photo is a common social media interaction. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention to someone else in a relationship is cheating. \n\nI should consider relationship boundaries. What one person considers a harmless like, another might see as crossing a line. Even if there's no romantic intent, the action could still be hurtful if it makes the partner uncomfortable. The girlfriend's belief that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" suggests she might have trust issues or a different view on what constitutes cheating.\n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't have any intention beyond friendship, and the friend is aware of that. However, actions can have unintended consequences. Even if the author didn't mean to show attraction, the act of liking a revealing photo might be seen as inappropriate in the context of a relationship. \n\nIt's also about communication. The author might need to be more mindful of their partner's feelings, even if they don't share the same perspective. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that this action crossed a boundary for her, which the author might not have been aware of. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible that while they didn't intend to cheat, they failed to consider their partner's feelings. The act itself isn't inherently wrong, but it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if there's no history of jealousy or if the girlfriend is being overly possessive, the blame might not be entirely on the author. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because there's no malicious intent, but they might need to address their girlfriend's concerns. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid if that's her boundary. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action was a like on a photo, which is common, and there's no evidence of further inappropriate behavior, maybe the answer is B (No). But some might argue that it's still a breach of trust.\n"
