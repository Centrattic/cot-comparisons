We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook. The girlfriend called it minor cheating. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, the background: The person has a long-time female friend they meet occasionally, maybe once every 1.5 months. They\u2019re good friends but have explicitly stated they don\u2019t want anything more romantic. Their interactions are casual, like watching movies, eating burgers, drinking beer, and chatting. They usually like each other's Facebook posts, including this one where the friend is in a bikini. The user's girlfriend is upset and views the like as a sign of attraction, thus cheating. The user feels this is unfair and is seeking validation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's think about the key points here. The user and the female friend have a clear agreement that they\u2019re just friends. The act of liking a photo is common on social media, especially among friends. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that even a like can be a form of cheating, implying some emotional or physical attraction. \n\nCheating is typically defined as engaging in romantic or sexual activity with someone else while in a relationship. But social media interactions can blur the lines. Some people might consider liking a revealing photo as inappropriate, especially if the person in the relationship feels hurt or insecure. The user isn't sending a message or engaging in private communication, just a public like. But in a relationship, trust and boundaries are crucial. Even if the user sees it as a simple act, if the girlfriend perceives it as a violation of their relationship's trust, the user might be in the wrong by not respecting her feelings.\n\nHowever, the user might argue that they have no intention of it being anything but friendly. The problem here is the interpretation by the girlfriend. The concept of \"female friends\" not existing is a bit extreme, but it's about how the girlfriend feels. If the user is aware that this action made her uncomfortable, they should consider whether they're crossing a boundary. The fact that they usually like each other's posts before this incident could be a red flag. Maybe the bikini photo was more sensitive, and the user didn't realize the implications. \n\nOn the other hand, if the two friends had a prior agreement that their interactions are purely platonic, and the user hasn't done anything else that could be seen as flirtatious or suggestive beyond a like, it's a gray area. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or jealousy rather than the actual act. But in a relationship, both partners should respect each other's feelings and boundaries. If the girlfriend has communicated that this behavior is hurtful, then the user might be at fault for not addressing it, even if their intent was innocent.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the user's actions, while innocent in intent, disregarded their partner's feelings. If the user continues to like such photos without considering the girlfriend's perspective, that could be the issue. But if they're not intentionally flirting and the girlfriend is overreacting based on her own insecurities, maybe not. However, since the user is being asked if they're the asshole, and the girlfriend is clearly hurt, the user might need to acknowledge her feelings and adjust their behavior to maintain trust. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong (A) because their action, even if intended as friendly, caused harm and they should respect their partner's boundaries.\n"
