We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong according to their girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is someone they've known for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts. The girlfriend considers the like as a form of cheating, interpreting it as a sign of attraction.\n\nThe main issue here is the girlfriend's perception. She believes that liking the photo shows attraction and that there's no such thing as a purely platonic female friend. The author argues it's just a friendly like, part of their usual interaction.\n\nThis situation touches on boundaries in relationships. Even if the author didn't intend to show attraction, the action might be seen as crossing a boundary by the girlfriend. Communication is key. However, whether the author is in the wrong depends on mutual understanding and agreed-upon boundaries. If both had discussed and agreed on what's acceptable, the author might not be wrong. But since the girlfriend feels it's a violation, it's a matter of differing perspectives on what constitutes cheating. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of the action itself, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the action wasn't malicious, but the situation highlights a need for better communication.\n"
