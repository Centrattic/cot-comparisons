We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend considers it a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has a long-term friendship with a female friend, and they agree they don't have romantic feelings. They occasionally like each other's posts, which is common on social media. The girlfriend, however, feels that liking the bikini photo is a sign of physical attraction and thus cheating.\n\nSo, the main question is whether a Facebook like can be considered cheating in this context. The author's perspective is that it's just a friendly interaction, part of their normal behavior. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's a boundary crossed, implying attraction and moving towards infidelity.\n\nCheating typically involves emotional or physical intimacy outside the relationship. But where social media interactions fall into this is subjective. Some people might see liking a photo as harmless, others might see it as crossing a line if it's a flirtatious or attention-seeking action. The key factors here are the context of the friendship, the history of their interactions, and the couple's agreed-upon boundaries.\n\nThe author mentions they are good friends who meet occasionally, and there's no history of attraction. The like is part of their usual interaction, so maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. But from her point of view, if she feels insecure or if this action triggers jealousy, then it's valid for her to express that. The problem here is communication and mutual understanding of boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, what's considered cheating can vary widely based on what both partners agree upon. If the couple hasn't discussed these boundaries, the author might not realize that even a like can be seen as a breach. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she does see it as a violation, so the author might be in the wrong if they didn't communicate or consider her feelings in this situation.\n\nBut then again, if there's no prior agreement that liking photos is off-limits, the author isn't necessarily wrong. It's more about whether the action was intentional in a way that's disrespectful to the girlfriend's feelings. The author might not have meant to cause harm, but if the girlfriend feels hurt, the author should take that into account and adjust their behavior, even if they don't see it as cheating themselves.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions were done with intent to flirt or if it's just a habitual interaction. If it's the latter, maybe they aren't in the wrong, but they should still address their girlfriend's concerns. However, if the girlfriend feels it's crossing a line, the author might need to respect that even if they don't see it the same way. But traditionally, in these sorts of cases, the person is expected to consider their partner's feelings and adjust their behavior to maintain trust. So maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), but they should still be empathetic and possibly avoid such actions if it causes issues.\n"
