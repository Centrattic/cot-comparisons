We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend who called it \"minor cheating.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The man and woman have known each other a long time, are just friends, and have explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They meet occasionally, and they often like each other's Facebook posts. In this case, the man liked a photo where the woman is in a bikini at the beach. His girlfriend is upset, interpreting the like as a sign of physical attraction and potential cheating.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective is that any interaction with this female friend, especially liking a revealing photo, could lead to deeper feelings and thus is a form of cheating. The man feels it's unfair because they're just friends and he didn't have any intention of showing attraction.\n\nI need to consider whether the act of liking the photo crossed a boundary. Liking a friend's photo is a common action online, often just a friendly gesture. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. In relationships, partners have different boundaries and sensitivities. The man might not realize that his actions, even if meant as casual, can cause his partner distress.\n\nThe crux here is communication. The couple needs to discuss what's acceptable. The man's action might be innocent, but if it upsets his girlfriend, it's important to address her feelings. But does liking a photo inherently mean he's being unfaithful? That's subjective. Some might argue it's a minor issue, while others see it as a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's belief that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without potential romantic feelings is a common but not universal viewpoint. It's possible she's projecting her own insecurities here. However, her feelings are real and need to be respected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not black and white. The man might not be in the wrong if his intent was purely friendly, but he's also responsible for considering his partner's perspective. The main issue is whether he acknowledged her feelings and adjusted his behavior accordingly. If he dismissed her concerns, that could be problematic. But if he's open to discussing and finding a compromise, like avoiding liking certain photos, that shows maturity.\n\nSo, while the man isn't necessarily in the wrong, it's a situation where both need to communicate better. The answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong if the context is purely friendly and there's no intent to harm. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, so the situation requires sensitivity from both sides. I think the answer is B (No), but with the note that communication is key here.\n"
