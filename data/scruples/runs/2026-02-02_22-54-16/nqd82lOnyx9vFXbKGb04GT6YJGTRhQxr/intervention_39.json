We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (ITA, or \"I'm the Asshole\") is in the wrong for liking a friend's bikini photo, which his girlfriend considered \"minor cheating.\" The scenario involves a female friend he's known for a long time, and they've clarified they don't want anything more than friendship. The girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction, leading her to label it as cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationships mentioned. The author and his female friend have made it clear they don't want a romantic relationship. They meet occasionally, and their interactions are platonic. The key issue here is the act of liking the photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction, but the author sees it as a normal, friendly interaction.\n\nI should think about whether liking a photo is inherently a romantic gesture. In many contexts, liking a friend's photo, even one where they're in a swimsuit, could be seen as a compliment without romantic intent. However, the girlfriend's perception is that this act breaches trust, which complicates things.\n\nNext, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She believes there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without potential romantic feelings. This might indicate she's insecure or has trust issues. The author isn't doing anything overtly romantic\u2014just a like. But if the girlfriend feels this is cheating, then maybe there's a communication breakdown. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't engaging in any physical or emotional intimacy with the friend. The act of liking a photo is public but not a private interaction. Still, in some relationships, even small gestures can be seen as problematic if one partner is uncomfortable. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally or morally, there's no wrong, but in terms of the relationship, it's about mutual respect and boundaries. If the girlfriend has expressed that this behavior makes her uncomfortable, then the author might need to consider her feelings, even if he doesn't see it as cheating. \n\nBut is he at fault? The author didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend, and he has a history of platonic interactions with the friend. If the girlfriend's definition of cheating includes such actions, it's more about her boundaries than the author's inherent wrongdoing. So maybe the answer leans towards B, he's not in the wrong, but there's a need for discussion about boundaries.\n"
