We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking a friend's bikini photo, which the girlfriend considers minor cheating. The author has a long-time female friend they meet occasionally and have agreed to just be friends. The girlfriend believes that liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definition of cheating. Cheating typically involves a breach of a relationship's boundaries, which are usually defined by the couple. If the couple has agreed that certain actions are off-limits, then doing those actions could be seen as cheating. The author didn't explicitly state if they discussed boundaries with their girlfriend. However, the friend in question is a female friend with whom they have no romantic intentions, and they've told each other they don't want more than friendship. \n\nLiking a photo can be a form of engagement that might be interpreted differently. The girlfriend's perception is that it's a sign of attraction. The author might see it as a friendly gesture. But since the girlfriend is the one who's upset, the relationship's health depends on communication and mutual respect. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, if the girlfriend feels it's a violation, then it's a boundary issue. \n\nThe answer would hinge on whether the couple had established that liking friends' photos, especially those in bikinis, is off-limits. If they didn't, then the author might not be in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's feelings are hurt and the act is considered a breach of trust, then the author's action, though seemingly minor, could be seen as wrong. The key here is the girlfriend's perspective and the agreed-upon boundaries. Without explicit prior agreement, it's a gray area, but the girlfriend's reaction indicates that this action crossed a line she drew. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from her perspective. But the user is asking for a yes or no answer based on the given info. Since the author didn't mention prior discussion, but the girlfriend is upset, the answer could lean towards B (No), because the intention was platonic. However, the girlfriend's POV defines her boundaries, so if she considers it cheating, the author is in the wrong for her. But according to AITA logic, it's more about the perception and the relationship's dynamics. The user says the author feels it's unfair, but the question is whether they are the asshole. In AITA contexts, the SO's feelings are valid, so the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the girlfriend's feelings. So maybe A (Yes). Wait, the author didn't do anything malicious, but if the girlfriend's definition of cheating includes that, then the answer is A. Alternatively, if there's no prior agreement, maybe B. But the girlfriend's definition is part of the relationship's boundaries. So the answer is A.\n"
