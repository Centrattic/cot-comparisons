We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by liking a friend's bikini photo, and his girlfriend considers it cheating. \n\nFirst, the context: The friend is female, they've known each other a long time, meet occasionally, and have clarified they don't want a romantic relationship. They usually like each other's posts, and this time it was a bikini photo. The girlfriend thinks it's cheating because it shows attraction.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether liking a photo constitutes cheating. The author argues it's just a friendly interaction, but the girlfriend feels it's a boundary crossed. \n\nI need to consider the definitions of cheating and what constitutes infidelity. Typically, cheating involves romantic or sexual activity outside the relationship. Liking a photo is a minor action, but it can be a gray area depending on the relationship's context and the partners' boundaries. \n\nThe key points are the mutual agreement between the author and his friend that they don't want anything more than friendship, and the girlfriend's perspective that such an action implies attraction leading to cheating. The girlfriend's power of will (POV) is that female friends inevitably lead to more feelings, so the author is somehow at fault by engaging in this action.\n\nBut is a like really cheating? It's a passive action, not an active pursuit of the friend. The author didn't message the friend about the photo, didn't engage beyond a like. The problem arises from the girlfriend's interpretation of the like as a sign of attraction. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are crucial. If the couple had discussed what actions are considered appropriate and the girlfriend clearly communicated that liking such photos is off-limits, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that boundary. However, if this was an unspoken boundary, the situation is more complicated. \n\nThe author's intention seems to be maintaining a friendship and not showing romantic interest. The girlfriend's perception is that it's a step towards cheating. But unless there's a prior agreement that such likes are unacceptable, it's hard to say the author is in the wrong. \n\nStill, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Even if the action is minor, if it causes distress, the author might need to address it. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong, not whether the girlfriend is upset. \n\nCheating is usually about betrayal. Liking a photo is a public action that doesn't involve physical intimacy or emotional commitment. Unless there's a cultural or personal norm where such actions are seen as cheating, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on the relationship agreements. Since the author and his friend have mutually agreed to remain friends, and the like is a common social media interaction, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's interpretation might stem from insecurity or different views on boundaries, but that doesn't make the author at fault for a like. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
