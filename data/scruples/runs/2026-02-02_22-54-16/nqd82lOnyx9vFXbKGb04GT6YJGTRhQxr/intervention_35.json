We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, and the girlfriend is calling it cheating. The author claims they're just friends with no romantic or sexual interest. The girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction, hence cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is a long-time acquaintance, they meet occasionally, and have a platonic relationship. The author likes other posts too, not just the bikini one. The girlfriend feels that any form of attention to another person, even a friend, is a form of cheating. \n\nNow, whether liking a photo is cheating. Cheating usually involves betrayal in a romantic relationship. But boundaries in relationships can vary. Some people are more sensitive about their partner's interactions with others. The key here is mutual understanding and communication. If the couple hasn't discussed what behaviors are acceptable, it's hard to judge. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or past experiences. The author might not realize how his actions affect her. \n\nThe question is whether the act of liking the photo is inherently wrong. There's no explicit rule against it, but in a relationship, partners might have unspoken boundaries. If the girlfriend feels hurt, the author should consider her feelings, even if he sees it as innocent. However, the author isn't intentionally being deceitful; he's maintaining a friendship. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be at fault if he had no intent to hurt, but the girlfriend's feelings matter. The problem isn't just the like itself but the lack of communication about boundaries. So, maybe the answer is B (No), but the situation needs better communication from both sides.\n"
