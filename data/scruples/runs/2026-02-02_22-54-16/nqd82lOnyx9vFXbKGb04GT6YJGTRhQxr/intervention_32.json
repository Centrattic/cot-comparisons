We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by liking a photo of their female friend in a bikini, and their girlfriend is calling it a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has known this friend for a long time, they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed that there's no romantic interest. They just hang out as friends. The friend posted a photo in a bikini, and the author liked it, which their girlfriend took offense to.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction, which implies cheating. The author thinks it's just a friendly gesture. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nI should think about what liking a photo signifies. On social media, a like is a common way to acknowledge someone's post. If the friends have a history of liking each other's posts, it might just be part of their normal interaction. The friend might post photos occasionally, and the author's like is a standard response. But the girlfriend feels that this specific like crosses a boundary, especially since the photo is in a bikini. \n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the like and the expectations in the relationship. The author claims there's no romantic intent, and the friend is just a friend. However, the girlfriend is interpreting the like as a sign of attraction. It's possible that the girlfriend is uncomfortable with the author interacting with this friend in any way that she perceives as flirtatious, even if it's not intended that way.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with the author liking photos of this friend, even if it's not meant to be flirtatious, then maybe the author should consider adjusting their behavior to respect the girlfriend's feelings. On the other hand, if the author believes that their actions are innocent and within acceptable friend boundaries, they might think the girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nBut the problem here is the girlfriend's perception. Even if the author didn't mean it to be flirtatious, the action still caused hurt or discomfort. The question is whether the author's action was wrong because it was perceived as cheating, regardless of intent. In some relationships, actions that are seen as disrespectful or potentially flirtatious can be problematic, even if unintended.\n\nSo, while the author might not have had malicious intent, if the girlfriend is taking it as cheating, then the author might need to address the situation. The answer hinges on whether the author should have considered the girlfriend's feelings and adjusted their behavior to avoid causing distress. If the author knew or should have known that their girlfriend would find it offensive, then they might be in the wrong. However, if the action was a normal, innocent interaction, then maybe not. But given that the girlfriend is calling it \"minor cheating,\" the author's action might be crossing a boundary that they should be aware of.\n"
