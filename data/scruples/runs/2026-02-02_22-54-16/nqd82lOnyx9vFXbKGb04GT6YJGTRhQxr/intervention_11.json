We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend considers a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term female friend they see occasionally. They've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's Facebook posts. This particular like on the bikini photo is the issue. The girlfriend believes that liking the photo implies attraction and counts as emotional cheating.\n\nI should think about boundaries in relationships. Liking a photo is a common online interaction. But the girlfriend's perspective is that it's a sign of physical attraction. The author argues it's just friendly interaction. The key here is whether the action violates any agreed-upon boundaries. The couple might have different views on what constitutes cheating. Some people consider emotional intimacy with others as cheating, while others don't. \n\nThe author's actions might not be malicious, but the girlfriend feels hurt. If they haven't discussed boundaries beforehand, it's hard to say the author is wrong. However, if the girlfriend clearly communicated her feelings previously, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that. But according to the given info, the girlfriend is bringing this up as a new issue. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's belief that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without romantic feelings. This could be a personal insecurity or past experiences affecting her perception. The author's actions, while innocent in intent, might still be hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't realize the girlfriend's discomfort, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's feelings are valid, then the author should consider her perspective. However, liking a photo is a minor action, and the girlfriend's interpretation might be overreaching. \n\nSo, based on the information provided, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong), as the action is common and the issue is more about differing views on boundaries rather than malicious intent.\n"
