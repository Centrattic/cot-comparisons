We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as per their girlfriend's claim of it being a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, the context is that they have a long-standing friendship with clear boundaries. They both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They occasionally meet up for casual activities, like watching movies and having beers. The key point here is that there's no history of romantic or sexual interest between them.\n\nThe girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of physical attraction, which leads her to feel cheated on. The user argues that liking is just a friendly gesture, especially since they often like each other's posts. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of interaction with a female friend could lead to deeper feelings and thus is a form of cheating.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationship dynamics. Liking a friend's photo, even if it's a bikini picture, is a common social media behavior. Without any indication that the user was trying to flirt or show romantic interest, the like seems innocuous. The user's actions don't cross into flirtatious territory, especially since their friendship is well-established and both have agreed on their boundaries.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because trust and comfort in a relationship are crucial. If she feels that such likes make her uncomfortable or breach the trust, it's important for the user to consider her perspective. But whether it's \"cheating\" depends on mutual understanding and the couple's agreed-upon boundaries. If they didn't discuss what constitutes cheating, the user might not be in the wrong, but perhaps they should have been more considerate of her feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for liking the photo, but the situation highlights the need for better communication about boundaries in their relationship. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for discussion to address the girlfriend's concerns.\n"
