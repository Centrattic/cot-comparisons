We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong. The girlfriend considers this a form of cheating, labeling it as \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend in question is a long-time acquaintance, and they meet occasionally. They're clear that there's no romantic interest between them. The man's girlfriend, however, feels that liking the photo indicates attraction and is a breach of trust.\n\nFrom the man's perspective, he's maintaining a platonic friendship and engaging in normal social media behavior. Liking photos is a common way to show support or acknowledge a friend's post. But his girlfriend's interpretation is that this action crosses a line into inappropriate territory. \n\nIt's important to note that the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Jealousy and insecurity can stem from various factors, including past experiences or personal boundaries. However, the man's actions weren't malicious; he didn't have any romantic intent. \n\nThe key here is whether the action itself was wrong or if the issue lies in the girlfriend's perception. The act of liking a photo doesn't inherently mean attraction, especially when there's a history of mutual liking posts. The problem arises from the girlfriend's interpretation and the fact that the man didn't consider how his action might affect her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The man might not have intended harm, but if his actions cause his partner distress, there's a responsibility to address those feelings. However, without prior discussion about boundaries regarding social media interactions, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. \n\nBut from a relationship standpoint, if the girlfriend feels that such actions are a form of cheating, then ignoring her feelings could be seen as dismissive. However, the act of liking itself isn't inherently cheating unless both parties have agreed that it's a boundary. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether the action itself was inappropriate or if it's the girlfriend's reaction that's the issue. Since the man didn't have ill intent and there's no prior agreement that liking friends' photos is a boundary, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the situation highlights a communication gap. The man might need to be more mindful of his partner's feelings moving forward, but the act itself isn't malicious.\n"
