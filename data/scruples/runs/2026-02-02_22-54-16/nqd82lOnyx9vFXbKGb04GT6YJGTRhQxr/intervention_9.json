We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as per the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend in question is someone they've known for a long time, and they meet occasionally. Both have explicitly stated that they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts on Facebook. The girlfriend is upset because the like on the bikini photo is seen as a form of cheating, implying attraction. The author argues that it's just a friendly like and not a sign of cheating.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective is that any physical attraction shown through liking a photo is cheating. The author's defense is that they're just friends and have no romantic intentions. The question is whether the author's action is wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend feels that liking a photo of a friend in a bikini is a breach of trust. Even if the author didn't intend it that way, actions can have different meanings to different people. In relationships, what one person sees as harmless, another might see as a red flag. The fact that the author and the friend have a history of mutual likes on Facebook might mitigate it, but the girlfriend's interpretation is based on her perception of the action.\n\nHowever, the author isn't engaging in any direct interaction beyond a like. Liking a post is a common social media action, often used to acknowledge or express appreciation without romantic intent. If the author and friend have always liked each other's posts before, it's possible that this is just part of their usual dynamic. Still, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because she perceives it as a breach of the relationship's boundaries she has with the author.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the action crosses the line into emotional infidelity. Emotional cheating can involve actions that create emotional intimacy outside the relationship. While a like might not be emotional, the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of attraction. The author needs to consider their partner's feelings and whether their actions, even if innocent, might be causing unnecessary hurt.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong in intent, but they need to be aware of how their actions affect their partner. The problem isn't the like itself but the perception and the lack of communication about boundaries. The author might need to address this with their partner to clarify their intentions and reassess their behavior to respect the partner's comfort levels.\n\nSo, is the author the asshole? It's a nuanced situation. The author's action isn't inherently wrong, but they should consider their partner's feelings and perhaps adjust their behavior to maintain trust. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on the girlfriend's perspective. If the action causes harm in the relationship, the author might need to take responsibility for not being more considerate. But if the action itself is neutral and the issue is the partner's interpretation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. This is a tough call, but leaning towards B (No) because the action itself isn't malicious, but maybe A (Yes) if the author should have been more aware of the partner's feelings. Hmm.\n"
