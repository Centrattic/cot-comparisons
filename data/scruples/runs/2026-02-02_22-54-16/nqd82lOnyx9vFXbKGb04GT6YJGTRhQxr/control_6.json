We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as their girlfriend considers it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend is someone they've known a long time and meet occasionally. They both explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They also usually like each other's posts. The key point is the like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction or desire, hence cheating.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the relationship dynamics. In many relationships, there are boundaries about interacting with others, especially regarding romantic gestures. If the girlfriend feels that liking a photo in a swimsuit is crossing a line, even if the author didn't intend it, the act could be seen as violating trust. But the author might argue it's just a friendly interaction. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is valid. If she interprets the like as flirtatious, then the author might not be considering her feelings. The fact that they both agreed to just be friends doesn't automatically prevent misunderstandings or hurt feelings. The author should probably have asked himself if the like could be misinterpreted. Since it led to conflict, maybe he did cross a boundary, even unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, if they were just friends and the like was a normal part of their interaction, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's boundaries are part of the relationship agreement, then the author might be at fault for not respecting them. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether there's an unspoken or agreed boundary. Since the girlfriend feels it's cheating, and the author didn't consider her perspective here, it's likely the author is the asshole. So I lean towards A.\n"
