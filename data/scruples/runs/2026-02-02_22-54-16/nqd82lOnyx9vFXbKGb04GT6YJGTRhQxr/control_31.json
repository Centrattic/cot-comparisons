We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend considers this a form of minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is a long-time female friend, and they've met occasionally. They've both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The issue here is the like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend feels that liking such a photo shows attraction and is cheating. The author argues it's just a friendly gesture.\n\nSo, the question is whether liking a friend's photo in a bikini is a breach of trust or cheating. It depends on the boundaries set in the relationship. If the couple agreed that likes or interactions with friends, especially in potentially attractive contexts, should be avoided, then the author might be in the wrong. But if there's no such agreement, and the like is seen as a normal, friendly action, then the author isn't wrong.\n\nCheating typically involves a betrayal of trust, but it's subjective. Some people might see a like as harmless, others might interpret it as flirtatious. The key here is the girlfriend's feelings and their communication. If they haven't discussed these boundaries, the author might not be in the wrong, but if the girlfriend feels violated, there's a communication issue. The author's intention was friendly, but the girlfriend's interpretation leads to conflict.\n\nIn relationships, respect for each other's feelings is crucial. The author might not be intentionally cheating, but the action caused hurt. Whether it's the author's fault or a communication breakdown is the crux. If the author knew or should have known that the like would upset the girlfriend, then maybe they're at fault. But if it's an honest misunderstanding, then both parties need to communicate better. The answer hinges on whether the action crossed a boundary the author was aware of or should have been aware of.\n"
