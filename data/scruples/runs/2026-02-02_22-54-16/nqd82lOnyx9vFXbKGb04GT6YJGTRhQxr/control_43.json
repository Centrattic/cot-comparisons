We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as per their girlfriend's accusation of \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is someone they've known for a long time, meet occasionally, and have a clear understanding of just being friends. They both acknowledge they don't want anything more. The act in question is a Facebook like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are the nature of their relationship with the friend and the girlfriend's perspective. The author argues that liking posts is a normal friendship gesture. However, in a romantic relationship, actions that the partner finds uncomfortable can affect the relationship dynamics. \n\nCheating typically involves emotional or physical infidelity. But here, the girlfriend feels that even a like could represent emotional betrayal. The author's actions might be a boundary issue in the eyes of the partner. Even if the author sees it as harmless, the girlfriend's feelings are valid and should be respected. So, the author might be at fault for not considering their partner's feelings and violating a boundary she sees as important. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. If the girlfriend hasn't previously discussed this concern, the author might not have known. However, once the issue is raised, continuing such behavior could be problematic. The author's responsibility is to respect their partner's feelings to maintain trust. \n\nIn conclusion, while the like itself isn't cheating, the girlfriend's perception of it as a breach of trust means the author needs to address it. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the impact on the partner's feelings, even if the action seems minor.\n"
