We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend considers it a form of \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The main points are that the author has a long-term female friend they've known for a while. They meet occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts. The issue arose when the author liked a photo of the friend in a bikini while she was on vacation. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the nature of the relationship between the author and the friend, the girlfriend's feelings, and whether liking the photo is a valid boundary cross. The author argues that they have a platonic relationship, but the girlfriend feels that liking the photo implies attraction, leading to jealousy or insecurity.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the author's actions caused emotional distress to their partner, even if unintentionally, some might argue that they should consider their partner's feelings more. However, others might say that liking a friend's photo is a normal social interaction and doesn't translate to cheating. The line between friendship and cheating can be subjective and depends on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries.\n\nThe author's girlfriend believes that any form of liking a photo from a former romantic interest (though in this case, they are just friends) could indicate unresolved feelings. But the author and the friend have both confirmed their boundaries. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that the act of liking the photo, especially of her in a bikini, is a form of attraction. \n\nIt's important to note that relationships require mutual understanding and setting clear boundaries. If the author didn't intend to make their girlfriend uncomfortable but didn't consider her perspective, it could be seen as a failure to communicate. On the other hand, if the girlfriend's interpretation is overreacting without the author's intention, it might not be the author's fault.\n\nThe concept of \"minor cheating\" here is subjective. Some people might see it as a breach, while others don't. The answer hinges on the couple's communication and agreed-upon norms. Since the author didn't have the intent to show attraction, but the act caused distress, it's possible the author is in the wrong for not addressing their partner's feelings proactively. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's reaction is based on insecurity not addressed, then the author might not be at fault.\n\nI need to decide whether the act of liking a photo crosses the line. If the couple hasn't discussed what actions are acceptable, the author might be in the wrong for not being aware of their partner's boundaries. But if the author has no intention and the girlfriend is projecting, maybe the answer is B. However, since the act caused harm, the answer could be A. The key is whether the action, regardless of intent, violates the trust in the relationship. If the girlfriend feels it's cheating, the author's failure to respect that feeling might make them the asshole. So leaning towards A.\n"
