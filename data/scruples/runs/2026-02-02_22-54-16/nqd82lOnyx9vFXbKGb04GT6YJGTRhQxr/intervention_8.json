We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo, which their girlfriend considers cheating.\n\nFirst, the context: the friend is someone they've known a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts on Facebook. The issue is the like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and thus cheating.\n\nSo, the main question is whether a simple like constitutes cheating. The author argues that it's just a friendly gesture and part of their usual interaction. The girlfriend, however, feels that any form of online interaction with a friend of the opposite sex can lead to deeper feelings and is a form of cheating.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and boundaries are key. The girlfriend's perspective is that even a small action can be a breach of trust. But the author maintains that their actions are within the bounds of a platonic friendship. \n\nCheating typically involves emotional or physical involvement beyond friendship. A like on a photo is a minor action, not a sign of affection or intent to pursue a relationship. Since both parties have agreed to remain friends, and there's no evidence of the author harboring romantic feelings, it's hard to see this as cheating. \n\nHowever, relationships can have personal boundaries. If the girlfriend finds this action unacceptable, the author should respect her feelings even if they don't agree. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They didn't cross into emotional or physical cheating. The issue is more about differing perceptions of what's acceptable. \n\nSo the answer would lean towards B, the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a need to address the girlfriend's feelings to maintain trust and communication.\n"
