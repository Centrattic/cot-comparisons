We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend considers minor cheating. The situation involves a long-time friend they both agree is just a friendship. The author's girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of physical attraction, leading to jealousy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and the female friend have a clear understanding that their relationship is purely platonic. They've communicated that they don't have romantic or sexual intentions. The author mentions that they occasionally meet and do typical friend activities, and they both have a history of liking each other's posts on Facebook, not just this specific bikini photo.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that any like from the author to the friend's photos implies attraction, which the author doesn't intend. The key here is whether the action (liking the photo) crosses boundaries in the relationship. The author argues that the like is just a friendly gesture, but the girlfriend feels it's a betrayal.\n\nNow, considering social norms, liking a friend's photo is generally a positive reaction, often used to show appreciation for the moment or the person. However, in the context of a romantic relationship, what constitutes appropriate behavior can vary. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable and perceives it as a breach of trust, even if the author intended it as a friend, it's a relationship issue that needs addressing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a strict standpoint of the girlfriend's feelings and relationship boundaries, the author's action might be seen as dismissive of her emotions. Even if there was no malicious intent, the act of liking a photo that the girlfriend finds problematic can be considered a mistake because it causes hurt. However, the author didn't have the intent to flirt or be inappropriate, given their established friendship and mutual understanding.\n\nIt's also important to note that relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the author was unaware of the girlfriend's sensitivity to such actions, it's a matter of communication breakdown. The author might not be in the wrong for the action itself, but perhaps in not being more considerate of the girlfriend's feelings in this context.\n\nIn summary, the author's action might not be inherently wrong, but the situation highlights a need for better communication and understanding between the couple about what behaviors are acceptable. The girlfriend's perspective is valid in that her feelings matter, so the author might need to adjust their actions to respect her boundaries, even if they don't see the issue themselves.\n"
