We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author liked a photo of a female friend in a bikini, and his girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and the female friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have clarified that they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's Facebook posts. The girlfriend is upset because she interprets the like as a sign of attraction leading to infidelity.\n\nThe author's perspective is that it's just a like, part of their usual interaction, and there's no romantic intent. The girlfriend's point of view is that any form of attention to another person can lead to more feelings, hence it's cheating.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the relationship boundaries between the author and the friend, the girlfriend's interpretation of the like, and the cultural or personal norms around social media interactions in relationships.\n\nIn some relationships, people might consider liking a friend's photo as harmless, especially if it's part of their usual behavior. However, others might feel that any positive attention given to someone of the opposite sex can be a red flag. The girlfriend's stance is that such actions could indicate attraction and thus are a form of cheating. But does a like equate to cheating?\n\nI think the answer depends on the couple's understanding of what's acceptable. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable about it, then maybe the author should reconsider the action. However, if the action is within the established boundaries they both agreed upon, then the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe author has a history of liking posts, and there's no indication that the friend has ever misinterpreted those likes as anything other than friendly. The girlfriend's argument is more about the potential for future feelings rather than actual actions. But the author hasn't crossed any lines beyond what they've both agreed is acceptable. The girlfriend might need to communicate her concerns more clearly and maybe discuss boundaries if she feels insecure. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The issue might stem from the girlfriend's insecurities rather than the author's actions. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
