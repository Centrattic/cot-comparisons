We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and the girlfriend considers it a form of cheating. The author and the friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have clarified they don't want anything more than friendship. The girlfriend's perspective is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without ulterior feelings leading to cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key point is whether liking a photo constitutes cheating. The author's intention was to like a photo, which is a common social media interaction. The friend is aware they're just friends and have established boundaries. The act of liking a photo could be seen as innocent, but the girlfriend feels betrayed. \n\nCheating typically involves a breach of trust in a romantic relationship. But liking a photo doesn't necessarily mean attraction or desire to be with that person. However, communication and perception matter. If the girlfriend interprets this action as a sign of attraction, it might be a trust issue. The author might not have intended harm, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. \n\nThe author's defense is that they have a clear understanding with the friend and the like is just a social gesture. The girlfriend's belief that female friends inevitably lead to infidelity is a bit extreme, but emotions can be subjective. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the action was purely innocent and both parties have agreed on boundaries, the author isn't wrong. But the girlfriend's perception is important. If the author knew this would upset the girlfriend and still did it, maybe there's some fault. However, the scenario suggests the author didn't have malicious intent. \n\nIn many cases, relationships involve discussing what behaviors are uncomfortable. If the girlfriend hadn't mentioned it before, the author might not have known. But once it's a point of contention, the author could consider the girlfriend's feelings more. However, the action itself isn't inherently cheating. So the answer likely leans towards B (No), but there's room for both perspectives.\n"
