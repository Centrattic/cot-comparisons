We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, which their girlfriend considers a form of cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is a long-time acquaintance, and they meet occasionally. They've both explicitly stated that they don't want anything more than friendship. The author likes her Facebook posts regularly, including this particular bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of physical attraction, hence calling it cheating.\n\nSo, what's the key here? The main issue is whether a Facebook like constitutes cheating. Cheating typically involves a breach of trust in a committed relationship. If the girlfriend believes that liking a photo is a form of cheating, that's a red flag. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they might not consider the girlfriend's feelings here. \n\nHowever, the author and the friend have a clear agreement about their friendship. The author didn't intend anything beyond friendship, and the friendship seems platonic. The problem arises from the girlfriend's perspective. But in relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend feels insecure about social media interactions, it's a sign that the author might not be fully aware of how their actions affect their partner. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't doing anything explicitly wrong. Liking a friend's photo is a common social media behavior. But in a relationship, partners might have boundaries they expect each other to respect. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the author didn't communicate or set boundaries that align with her comfort level. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the girlfriend expressed concerns before, the author should have been more cautious. However, since the friend is platonic and the author didn't intend anything else, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is over the top. But in a relationship, if your partner interprets your actions as cheating, even if you didn't mean it, you might still be in the wrong because you didn't consider their feelings. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author didn't act with malicious intent, and the friendship is clearly defined. However, the author should have considered their girlfriend's feelings and maybe adjusted their behavior to avoid making her uncomfortable. But technically, the act of liking a photo isn't cheating unless both parties agreed otherwise. The girlfriend's reaction might be an issue of insecurity rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
