We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about liking a female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and the girlfriend considers it minor cheating. \n\nFirst, the author and the friend have known each other for a long time. They meet occasionally, just hang out as friends, and have clarified they don't want anything more than friendship. The author likes her posts on Facebook, including a bikini photo. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks this shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries in relationships. The girlfriend feels that even a like on a photo is crossing a line. The author argues it's just a friendly gesture, part of their usual interaction. But the girlfriend's POV is that any form of attention, especially on a revealing photo, is a sign of attraction and could lead to infidelity. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship. If the couple has an understanding that certain actions are not allowed, then the author might be wrong. However, in this case, the author didn't have prior knowledge that liking posts was off-limits. The friend is also aware that their relationship is strictly platonic. \n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is valid because she feels hurt and sees it as a breach of trust. Even if the author didn't intend it that way, the action caused distress. In relationships, communication about boundaries is crucial. The author might not be in the wrong if there was no prior agreement against such actions, but the girlfriend's feelings need to be considered. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's assumption that a like equals attraction might be a bit extreme, but her feeling that it's a form of cheating is her perspective. The author should probably have been more cautious, considering their girlfriend's sensitivity. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether there was an unspoken boundary. If the author didn't know, maybe he's not at fault. But if the girlfriend had expressed concerns before, then maybe he is. Since the scenario doesn't mention prior warnings, but the girlfriend is now labeling it as cheating, it's a bit tricky. \n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong technically, but he should probably have been more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also influenced by her own insecurities. It's a bit of a gray area, but the question is whether the author is the asshole. Since he didn't have explicit boundaries and the action is common among friends, maybe he's not wrong. But the fact that his girlfriend feels wronged is important. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (No), because the author didn't intentionally cross a line, and the act of liking a photo is a common social gesture. However, he could have communicated better. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if there's no prior agreement, it's not his fault. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
