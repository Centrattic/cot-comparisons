We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and their girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user has known this friend for a long time, they meet occasionally, and they've both explicitly stated that they don't want a romantic relationship. They're just friends who like each other's posts. The key point here is the girlfriend's perspective. She feels that liking the photo is a sign of attraction and thus cheating.\n\nNow, cheating typically involves a breach of trust in a romantic relationship. But the definition can vary based on what the couple agrees on. Some people might consider certain actions as crossing boundaries even if others don't. The user's action was just a like, which is a common thing on social media. However, the girlfriend is interpreting it as a form of physical attraction and a betrayal.\n\nI should think about whether the user's actions were intentional. They said they often like her posts, not just this one. So, maybe it's a habit or sign of friendship. But in this case, the photo was of her in a bikini, which could be seen as more revealing or attention-seeking. The user's girlfriend is hurt because she feels this is a sign of attraction, even if the user didn't mean it that way.\n\nThe user's argument is that there's no wrong in having a female friend, and they've established that they don't want anything more. But the girlfriend's point is that such a relationship might lead to more feelings and that the like is a step towards that. It's about trust and how the action is perceived. Even if the user didn't intend it, if the action causes their girlfriend distress or feels like a betrayal, that's part of the issue.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user might not see the like as a problem, but if their partner does, there's a conflict. The question is whether the user is wrong by not respecting their partner's feelings. Liking a friend's photo in a bikini could be seen as flirtatious or inappropriate by some, especially if the friend is someone the partner is uncomfortable with.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might be in the right if they've had clear boundaries and the action was within those. But the fact that the girlfriend is calling it cheating suggests that maybe the user isn't considering her perspective enough. It's possible that the user didn't realize the significance of the action to their partner. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the couple's agreed-upon definition of cheating. If the girlfriend perceives it as cheating, and the user didn't check in with her or adjust their behavior to respect her feelings, then the user might be in the wrong. But if the user had no intention and the action was within their established boundaries, maybe not. However, since the girlfriend is hurt and calls it cheating, the user might need to reflect on whether their actions, even if not intended, are causing harm. In that case, the user could be at fault for not being sensitive to her feelings. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards B (No), but there's a nuance. The user isn't necessarily cheating, but they might be inconsiderate. The girlfriend's feelings matter here. If the user had a discussion and agreed that such likes are okay, then B. But if the girlfriend's definition includes actions that make her feel betrayed, then maybe A. However, the user's description doesn't mention prior discussions about social media boundaries, so the default assumption is that they didn't consider that. Therefore, the answer could be B, but the user should have communicated better. Wait, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the action is within normal friend behavior but the partner feels wronged, it's more about the partner's feelings. The user isn't cheating, but they might be missing the emotional impact. So the answer is B, but there's a need for dialogue. Since the options are A or B, and the user's perspective is that the action is innocent, the answer is B.\n"
