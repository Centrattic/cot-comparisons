We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as his girlfriend considers it a form of cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user and his friend have been friends for a long time and meet occasionally. They've both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The user usually likes her posts, including this one where she's in a bikini. The girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of attraction, which the user denies.\n\nNow, relationships can have different boundaries. The key point here is whether the action (liking a photo) violates the agreed-upon boundaries. The user argues there's no romantic intention, but the girlfriend feels it's a breach. \n\nFrom a social perspective, liking a photo is a common, low-key interaction. However, in a relationship, what's considered acceptable can vary based on the couple's specific norms. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with any interaction that could be seen as flirtatious or suggestive, even if unintended, the user might need to adjust his behavior to respect her feelings. \n\nBut does that make the user in the wrong? If there's no prior agreement about such actions being off-limits, it's tricky. The user didn't have malicious intent. However, relationships require mutual respect for each other's feelings. Dismissing the girlfriend's feelings as unfair might be the real issue here. The user should communicate better and possibly avoid actions that cause discomfort, even if they seem minor.\n\nOn the other hand, if the user genuinely believes there's no romantic implication and the girlfriend is overreacting, the problem might be about differing expectations. The user isn't the asshole if he's acting based on past agreements and good intentions, but he should still address the issue to maintain trust. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong (B), but it's important to note that addressing the girlfriend's feelings is necessary for a healthy relationship.\n"
