We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend's claim that it's a form of cheating. The author of the post is seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friends have known each other for a long time and meet occasionally. They've both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The girlfriend is upset that liking the photo is a sign of attraction and cheating. \n\nThe question is whether liking a photo of a friend in a bikini is a betrayal. The key points are the relationship between the author and the friend, the nature of the like, and the girlfriend's perspective. \n\nFrom the author's standpoint, they see it as a normal friend interaction\u2014they like each other's posts, and this was no different. They didn't engage in anything more than a like. However, the girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of attraction and a violation of trust. \n\nFriendship boundaries can be subjective. What one person sees as harmless, another might see as inappropriate. The girlfriend's belief that female friends can't just be friends and that such actions lead to infidelity is a common but problematic view. It's important to consider mutual respect in a relationship. If the girlfriend feels this action breaches trust, then from her perspective, it's a problem. \n\nBut the author argues they have no romantic intentions and have a clear agreement with the friend. The issue here is about perception and communication. The author may not be in the wrong if there was no prior agreement about such interactions. However, if the girlfriend feels it's a boundary that shouldn't be crossed, then it's a conflict in the relationship. \n\nI need to weigh both sides. The author's actions may not be malicious, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship and how they've communicated boundaries. If the girlfriend didn't previously express this as a boundary, the author might not be at fault. But if this is part of a pattern where the author knew this would hurt, then maybe they are. \n\nIn the absence of prior communication about such likes, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's feelings are important, and the author should consider discussing it with her to understand her perspective better and maybe adjust their actions to respect her feelings. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because there's no indication they acted with intent to harm, and the friendship was clear. But it's a situation where communication could help resolve the issue.\n"
