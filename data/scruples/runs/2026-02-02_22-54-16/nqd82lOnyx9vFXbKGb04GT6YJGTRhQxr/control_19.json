We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as his girlfriend considers it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says they've been friends a long time, see each other occasionally, and have no romantic intentions. They often like each other's posts on Facebook. The girlfriend feels that liking the bikini photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nThe main issue here is whether a Facebook like can be considered a form of cheating. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attraction or interaction with another person that shows interest crosses a boundary. The author argues that there's no romantic intent, and it's just a friend-like action.\n\nFriendships can sometimes be tricky when one person is in a relationship. The key points here are the history between the friends, the nature of their interactions, and the girlfriend's feelings. The author claims there's no attraction, but the girlfriend is hurt and feels betrayed. The question is about whether the like was an innocent action or a boundary violation.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If the couple hasn't discussed what's acceptable behavior regarding friends of the opposite sex, misunderstandings can happen. The author might not see the like as a big deal, but if the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of attraction, it's causing harm. Even if the author's intention is innocent, the action might still be problematic if it causes emotional distress.\n\nHowever, the context is that they are just friends who occasionally interact, and the author doesn't have romantic feelings. The like on a bikini photo might be seen as crossing a line, especially if the girlfriend is uncomfortable with it. But whether that makes the author wrong depends on the agreed-upon boundaries in the relationship.\n\nSince there's no explicit agreement mentioned, it's a matter of perception. The girlfriend's feeling of betrayal suggests she has different boundaries than the author. In relationships, respecting each other's comfort levels is crucial. If the author knew this would upset his girlfriend, then not liking the photo might have been better. But if the like was a usual action and the girlfriend is overreacting, the author might not be at fault.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action was intentional in showing attraction or if it's just a habitual like without any romantic intent. Since the author and friend don't have romantic feelings, but the action still caused harm, maybe the author is not in the wrong, but he should communicate better. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid, then the author might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective.\n\nI'm leaning towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the intention was likely innocent, but the situation highlights the need for better communication about boundaries. However, it's also possible that the girlfriend's feelings are valid, making the author responsible for not addressing her concerns before the action. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is B, but there's room for both sides.\n"
