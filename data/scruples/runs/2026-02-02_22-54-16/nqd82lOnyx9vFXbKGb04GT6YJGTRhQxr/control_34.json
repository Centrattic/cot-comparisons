We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend who called it \"minor cheating.\" The key points here are the relationship between the individuals and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the author has a long-term female friend, and they've both agreed there's no romantic or physical attraction between them. They meet occasionally and have a platonic friendship. The author likes their friend's Facebook posts, including a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and considers it cheating. The author feels it's unfair since there's no romantic intent.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's viewpoint, she believes that any interaction with a female friend could lead to more feelings and is thus a form of cheating. From her perspective, the act of liking the photo, even if done platonically, is crossing a line. The question is whether the author's action is wrong.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries can vary. Some people are comfortable with friends liking each other's photos, while others may find it inappropriate, especially if it's a close friend. The author isn't engaging in any physical interaction or romantic behavior beyond a like, which is a common social media action. However, the girlfriend's discomfort suggests that the action, though minor, is violating her personal boundaries. \n\nThe concept of cheating isn't black and white here. Cheating typically involves a breach of trust through romantic or physical infidelity. Liking a photo alone doesn't equate to that. However, if the girlfriend perceives it as a betrayal, the author's continued action without addressing her feelings could be seen as dismissive of her needs. \n\nBut the author argues that there's no intent beyond friendship. The key here is communication. If the girlfriend has expressed this as an issue, the author should consider her feelings and perhaps avoid liking such posts to respect her boundaries. However, the act itself isn't inherently wrong; it's more about respecting the partner's feelings and adjusting behavior to maintain trust.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the action violates the agreed-upon boundaries in their relationship. If the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author is aware, then the author might need to adjust their behavior to honor the relationship's dynamics. But the act of liking a photo isn't objectively wrong\u2014it's subjective based on the couple's agreements.\n"
