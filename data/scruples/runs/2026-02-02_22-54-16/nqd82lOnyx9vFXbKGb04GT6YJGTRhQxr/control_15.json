We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, with their girlfriend considering it as minor cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend in question is a long-time friend they meet occasionally. They've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts. The girlfriend is upset because liking the bikini photo is seen as a sign of attraction or cheating.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boundaries in the relationship. The girlfriend feels that liking such a photo implies attraction, which the author denies. The author argues it's just a friendly gesture. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of interaction with another person that shows attraction is cheating, even if it's minor.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend perceives the action as cheating, even if the author didn't intend it, then it's a problem. The fact that they both have agreed the relationship is just friendship is important, but the girlfriend's feelings can't be ignored. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's belief that all female friends will eventually lead to cheating might be a red flag in itself. But the author's action, while perhaps not intended as flirtatious, could still be seen as crossing a boundary set by the partner. Even if the author didn't mean it, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because in a relationship, respecting the partner's comfort levels is important.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the action was a breach of trust or unspoken boundaries. Since the girlfriend is hurt and sees it as cheating, the author might need to consider her perspective. But the author might argue that it's a normal interaction. However, in the context of the girlfriend's strong reaction, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and for not respecting her boundaries, even if unintentionally."
