We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong. The girlfriend considers this a form of cheating, but the person argues that they're just friends and there's no attraction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friends have been friends a long time, meet occasionally, and have no romantic intention. They often like each other's posts. The girlfriend is upset because the like on a bikini photo is seen as a sign of physical attraction. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) The relationship between the user and the friend is platonic. 2) The girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of attraction, which the user denies. 3) The user's action is a simple like on a photo, which is a common social media interaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether this action is wrong. From a general perspective, liking a friend's photo, even if they're in a bikini, might not be considered cheating unless there's a specific agreement against it. However, trust and communication in a relationship are important. The girlfriend's feelings matter here. Even if the user sees it as harmless, if the girlfriend is hurt, the user needs to consider her perspective.\n\nBut the user isn't doing anything more than liking a photo. There's no evidence of flirting or other actions. The girlfriend's belief that a like equates to cheating might be an overreaction based on her insecurities. However, the user should also be aware of how their actions affect their partner. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable, the user might need to adjust their behavior, even if they don't see it as wrong.\n\nIn terms of whether the user is in the wrong, it's more about the girlfriend's perception and the trust between them. The action itself isn't inherently wrong, but the fact that it's causing conflict might require the user to address their partner's feelings. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the action isn't cheating, but the user should still communicate and find a way to make their partner feel secure.\n"
