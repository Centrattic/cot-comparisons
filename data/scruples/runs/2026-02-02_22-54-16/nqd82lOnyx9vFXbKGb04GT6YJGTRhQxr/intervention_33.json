We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend's claim of it being \"minor cheating.\" The friend in question is a long-time friend they see occasionally and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. The girlfriend argues that liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context better. The man's action is liking a photo of his female friend in a bikini. The girlfriend feels this is inappropriate. The key points here are the nature of the relationship between the man and his friend, the girlfriend's perspective, and societal norms.\n\nThe man and his friend have a clear boundary: they're just friends with no romantic interest. They interact occasionally, and their interactions are platonic. Liking Facebook posts is a common social behavior among friends. However, the girlfriend interprets this action as a sign of attraction, which the man doesn't intend. \n\nNow, the question is whether the man is wrong for liking the photo. The girlfriend's belief is that any form of interaction with a female friend could lead to infidelity. But from the man's perspective, he's maintaining clear boundaries and the friend is aware of that. \n\nIt's important to consider the girlfriend's feelings here. Even if the man didn't mean anything by it, if she feels it's crossing a line, that's a valid emotional concern. However, whether the man is \"in the wrong\" depends on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries. If they've discussed what's acceptable and the man hasn't violated those terms, then he might not be at fault. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a different interpretation of social cues. The man's action could be seen as harmless by some, but if it's causing distress in the relationship, the man might need to consider his partner's feelings and adjust his behavior, even if he doesn't see it as wrong. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, liking a friend's photo is generally seen as friendly. However, in the context of a romantic relationship, what's considered acceptable can vary. The key is communication between the couple. If the man hasn't agreed to avoid liking such photos and his girlfriend is upset, it might be a matter of respect for her feelings even if the action itself isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether maintaining the action despite the girlfriend's feelings is acceptable. The man isn't malicious, but if his actions are causing harm, even unintentionally, it's worth addressing. But strictly from the scenario given, the man didn't have ill intent and the boundaries between him and his friend are clear. The girlfriend's reaction might be about her own insecurities rather than the man's actions being inherently wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. However, it's important to note that relationships require mutual understanding and communication, and the man might need to have a conversation to address his girlfriend's concerns.\n"
