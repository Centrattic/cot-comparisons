We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is wrong, especially since their girlfriend called it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend is someone they've known a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts. The girlfriend is upset because liking the bikini photo is seen as showing attraction, which she interprets as cheating.\n\nThe main issue here is trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author didn't have any ill intent, but the girlfriend feels hurt. Even though the author and the friend are just friends, actions can be misinterpreted. The key is whether the action crossed a boundary the girlfriend had set. \n\nIn relationships, what one person sees as harmless, another might find offensive. The girlfriend's perspective is that any like on a revealing photo could signal attraction, which she doesn't want. The author might not see it that way, but the fact that it caused distress means there's a communication problem. \n\nThe question is if the author is wrong. Since the action led to hurt feelings and the girlfriend felt it was cheating, even if unintentionally, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how it would be perceived. However, if the action was purely platonic and the girlfriend's interpretation is overreaching, maybe not. But typically, in such cases, maintaining your partner's comfort is important. So, possibly A (yes, in the wrong), but maybe B (no) if intent is pure. However, the answer might lean towards A because actions have consequences, regardless of intent.\n"
