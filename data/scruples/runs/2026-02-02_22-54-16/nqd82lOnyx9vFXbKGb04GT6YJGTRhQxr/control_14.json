We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as their girlfriend called it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend in question is someone they've known for a long time, meet occasionally, and have a platonic relationship. They've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. The user likes the photo, which is a bikini picture from a beach trip. The girlfriend feels that liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nNow, from a general perspective, liking a photo is a common social media interaction. People often like photos of friends regardless of their gender. The user and the friend have been clear about their boundaries, so the action might not be intended as anything more than friendly. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention towards another person can be seen as cheating, which is her personal boundary.\n\nThe key here is understanding the girlfriend's viewpoint. If she defines liking a photo as cheating, then from her standpoint, the user violated that boundary. Even if the user didn't intend it that way, the girlfriend feels hurt, which is a valid emotional response. The question is whether the user crossed a boundary by not respecting their girlfriend's feelings or if the girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual understanding of boundaries are crucial. If the user was aware that their partner felt this way and still chose to like the photo, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the girlfriend hadn't communicated this boundary clearly before, the user might not be entirely at fault. But since the action caused distress, the user might need to apologize and be more mindful in the future.\n\nSo, whether the user is in the wrong depends on the relationship's dynamics. If they were aware of the girlfriend's feelings and ignored them, then yes. If the girlfriend raised this issue for the first time, the user isn't necessarily wrong, but they should respect her feelings moving forward. The answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
