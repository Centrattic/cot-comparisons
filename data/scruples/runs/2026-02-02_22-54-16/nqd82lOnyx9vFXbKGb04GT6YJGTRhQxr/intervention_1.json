We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about liking a female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and the girlfriend is upset, calling it \"minor cheating.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a long-term female friend. They meet occasionally, hang out in a platonic way, and have explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The girlfriend is upset because liking the bikini photo is seen as a sign of attraction or cheating. The author argues it's just a friendly action, part of mutual likes on each other's posts.\n\nI need to consider the perspective of both parties. From the author's side, it's a simple like on a photo, part of normal social media interaction. They've had no romantic intentions with the friend and maintain a platonic relationship. However, the girlfriend feels betrayed, thinking that even a like could indicate attraction. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or jealousy. Even if the action is innocent, if it upsets the partner, maybe there's something to discuss. But does that make the author wrong? It depends on the context. If the author didn't have any ill intent and the action is common among friends, maybe they aren't wrong. However, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author could have been more considerate, there might be some fault.\n\nThe key factors are: the author's intentions (no attraction), the nature of the friendship (clear boundaries), and the girlfriend's perspective (feeling of betrayal). Since the author didn't act with malice and the action is a typical social media interaction, they might not be in the wrong. However, relationships require sensitivity to each other's feelings. Maybe the author could have been more aware of how the action might be perceived, even if unintentionally. But given the context, the author likely isn't at fault. The answer would be B."
