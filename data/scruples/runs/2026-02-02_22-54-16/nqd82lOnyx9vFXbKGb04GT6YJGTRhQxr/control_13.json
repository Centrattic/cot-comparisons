We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their friend's bikini photo is in the wrong according to their girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" The situation is that the man and his female friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. He likes her Facebook posts, including a bikini picture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's viewpoint. She believes that liking the photo is an act of physical attraction and implies something more than friendship. She thinks there's no such thing as a female friend without one developing feelings eventually. The man argues that it's just a friendly like, part of their usual interaction.\n\nIs he wrong? Well, actions can have different meanings. From an outsider's perspective, liking a photo is a minor action, but in a relationship, what's considered acceptable varies. The key here is communication and trust. If the girlfriend feels insecure or sees it as a boundary crossed, maybe the man should consider her feelings. However, if both friends have always maintained a clear boundary and there's no history of jealousy or misunderstanding, the action might be seen as harmless.\n\nBut relationships have their own dynamics. Even if the action is innocent, if it causes hurt, the person might need to address it. The man's responsibility might be to acknowledge her feelings and perhaps adjust his behavior if it's causing distress, even if he doesn't see it as wrong. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on mutual understanding. If both agreed on boundaries, and liking posts is part of their normal interaction, then maybe not. But if the girlfriend's feelings are valid and he should respect them, then he might be at fault for not considering her perspective.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether respecting the partner's feelings is necessary even if the action seems minor. In many relationship contexts, acknowledging a partner's comfort is important. Therefore, the answer might be A, but there's nuance. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend perceives it as cheating, and in relationships, perceptions matter, the answer could be A. But some might argue B if the action is objectively innocent. However, the consensus in such situations often leans toward considering the partner's feelings as valid, so A.\n"
