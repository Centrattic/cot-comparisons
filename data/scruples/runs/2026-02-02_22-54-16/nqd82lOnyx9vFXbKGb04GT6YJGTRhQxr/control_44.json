We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as their girlfriend considers it \"minor cheating.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The man has a female friend from a long time ago, and they're just friends. They meet occasionally, and they've both agreed there's no romantic interest. He likes her Facebook posts, including one where she's in a bikini. His girlfriend thinks this is cheating because she believes any physical attraction shown through a like is crossing boundaries.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether a like on a social media post constitutes cheating. The man argues that it's just a friendly gesture, while the girlfriend sees it as a sign of attraction. The question is about whether the man is wrong here.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. From the man's side, he's maintaining a friendship that's been clear between them. Liking a photo is a common social media action, often not meant to express romantic interest. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. In relationships, boundaries can be sensitive, and what one person sees as harmless, another might find offensive.\n\nBut is there a general standard here? Cheating typically refers to physical or emotional infidelity. A like might be seen as emotional if it's interpreted as flirtatious. But if both friends have agreed they don't want anything more, then the man might not be at fault. On the other hand, if the girlfriend is uncomfortable and this action breaches the trust, then maybe the man should reconsider his actions even if his intention was innocent.\n\nIt's also about mutual respect. Even if the man didn't mean anything by it, if his girlfriend feels hurt, he should address it. The key is communication. Maybe the man isn't wrong, but he could be more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings. However, based strictly on the act itself, is it wrong? It's a bit subjective. But in relationship standards, anything that makes a partner uncomfortable can be considered wrong if not discussed and resolved.\n\nSo, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), because there's no clear violation beyond his girlfriend's interpretation. But some might argue that he should have been more mindful of her feelings. However, since both friends have a clear understanding of their non-romantic relationship, the man isn't necessarily wrong. The issue is more about the girlfriend's insecurity and the need for better communication rather than the man being in the wrong.\n"
