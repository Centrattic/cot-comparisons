We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini. Let me break this down.\n\nThe key points from the scenario: The author and this female friend have been friends a long time, meet occasionally, and have both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's Facebook posts. The girlfriend is upset that liking the bikini photo is a form of cheating. She thinks that liking the photo shows attraction, implying that there's no such thing as a platonic female friend.\n\nThe author's defense is that they've established boundaries and that the like was just a friendly gesture. They're wondering if their girlfriend's reaction is unfair. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the community's take.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is about boundaries in relationships. The girlfriend feels that any sign of attention to another person, even a friend, is cheating. The author argues that their actions are within a platonic friendship. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, in some relationships, certain actions might be considered red flags. Liking a photo of someone in a swimsuit could be seen as showing attraction, even if it's just a like. The girlfriend's perspective is that this is a form of emotional infidelity, which some people take seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a long-standing friendship with clear boundaries. Both parties have agreed not to pursue anything beyond friendship. The act of liking a photo is common among friends. The girlfriend's assertion that there's no such thing as a female friend might be a bit extreme, as many people can maintain platonic friendships with the opposite sex.\n\nBut relationships are subjective. What's acceptable to one person might not be to another. The author might need to consider why the girlfriend is so sensitive about this. Is it about trust? Past issues? How they've defined their boundaries?\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they had no intention beyond friendship and have maintained that, then technically, they haven't broken any agreed-upon rules unless they were specifically told not to interact a certain way with this friend. The girlfriend's interpretation is that the like is a breach, but the author might not see it that way unless there was prior discussion about such actions.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the agreed boundaries. If the couple hasn't discussed what constitutes cheating and the girlfriend is now redefining it, that could be an issue. But if the author didn't cross any lines they were aware of, they might not be in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should address them to avoid future conflicts.\n"
