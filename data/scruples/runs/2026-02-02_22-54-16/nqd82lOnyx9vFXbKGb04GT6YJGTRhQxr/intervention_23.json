We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which his girlfriend considers minor cheating.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and the friend have known each other a long time, see each other occasionally, and have clarified they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's Facebook posts. The issue here is liking a specific photo where the friend is in a bikini.\n\nThe girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of physical attraction or flirtation, which the author denies. The question is about whether the like crosses boundaries in their relationship.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's just a friendly like. But from the girlfriend's viewpoint, it's a breach because it's perceived as showing attraction to another person. Relationships often have unspoken boundaries, and if the girlfriend feels violated, that's a valid emotion to consider.\n\nHowever, the author argues that there's no romantic interest and that they're just friends. Liking a photo is a common social media action, so maybe it's not malicious. But in relationships, trust and comfort matter. If the action causes distress, the author might need to consider that even if he doesn't see it as wrong, his girlfriend does.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The couple's communication about boundaries. If they discussed it and agreed that liking such photos is okay, then maybe not. If they didn't, and the girlfriend feels it's a problem now, the author's responsibility is to respect her feelings. 2) The intent vs. perception. The author didn't mean to flirt, but the act might still be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on their relationship dynamics. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable and the author knew there was a potential issue, he might have a responsibility to avoid actions that cause her distress. Even if his intention was innocent, the effect matters in maintaining trust and respect in a relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong in terms of intent, but he should consider his girlfriend's feelings. However, if they had established boundaries and he ignored them, then he would be in the wrong. Since the prompt doesn't mention prior discussions, it's a bit ambiguous. But the girlfriend's perception is valid, so the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because actions that make a partner uncomfortable can be considered wrong in a relationship context, even if the intention was innocent.\n"
