We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as called out by their girlfriend for being a form of cheating. The friend in question is someone they've known for a long time, meet occasionally, and they both have agreed that there's no romantic interest. The girlfriend's main point is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without eventual romantic feelings, leading to cheating.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the boundaries of the friendship and the girlfriend's perception. The author argues that they have a platonic relationship, and liking a photo is just a normal interaction. The girlfriend, however, sees it as a sign of attraction and thus cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple's relationship dynamics are crucial. If the girlfriend has established that certain actions are off-limits because they make her uncomfortable, even if the action seems trivial, then maybe the author should have respected that boundary. But the author didn't know it would upset her, so maybe it's not intentional.\n\nOn the other hand, in relationships, partners often have expectations about how each other interacts with others. Even if the author didn't have ill intent, if the action caused harm or discomfort to the girlfriend, it's a communication issue. The author might not be in the wrong for liking a photo, but they might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's feelings. However, the girlfriend's belief that all female friendships will lead to cheating is extreme and could indicate insecurity or jealousy issues. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for the action itself, but perhaps they should have been more aware of their partner's boundaries. But since the girlfriend's reasoning is based on the idea that no female friend can exist without romantic feelings, that's a problematic belief. The author's actions alone don't necessarily make them an asshole unless they crossed a clear boundary they were both aware of. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the action itself isn't inherently wrong, but the situation involves the girlfriend's personal boundaries and their communication about them. However, if the girlfriend communicated that liking such photos is a boundary, then the author should respect that. The problem here is that the author didn't know it was a problem until after the fact. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's a form of cheating, but the author's actions don't meet the traditional definition of cheating. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation points to a need for better communication between the couple.\n"
