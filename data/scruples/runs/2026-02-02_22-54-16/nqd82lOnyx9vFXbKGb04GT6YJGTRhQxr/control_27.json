We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author liked a photo of their female friend wearing a bikini on Facebook. Their girlfriend is calling it a form of cheating. The author says they've been friends a long time, meet occasionally, and have clarified they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's side: they're maintaining a friendship and engaging in normal social media behavior. Liking a photo is a common action, and they argue it's just friendly. They don't see it as cheating because there's no romantic intent.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction and is a step towards infidelity. She believes that having a \"female friend\" inevitably leads to more feelings and cheating. She's upset because she feels the like was a sign of physical attraction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Cheating typically involves romantic or sexual fidelity. Liking a photo isn't a physical act, but the girlfriend interprets it as such. The key here is the intent and the perception. The author didn't have romantic intent, but the action was misinterpreted by the girlfriend. \n\nFriendships, especially between opposite genders, can be complex. The author and friend have boundaries in place. However, actions that one person sees as friendly can be seen as flirtatious or inappropriate by a partner. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her insecurities or different views on what constitutes cheating in a relationship.\n\nIs liking a photo a form of cheating? It's a gray area. Some might say no, as it's a minor action without direct interaction. Others might say yes if it's part of a pattern of behavior that leads to emotional or physical infidelity. The author's girlfriend seems to draw the line here, so even if the author didn't mean to, the action caused distress and is seen as a violation of trust.\n\nBut the author didn't have the intention to cheat. The issue is about how the action is perceived. In relationships, communication and mutual understanding of boundaries are crucial. If the girlfriend expressed her concerns about such actions and the author continued, they might be at fault. However, from the description, it seems the author didn't know this would upset her until after the fact. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the girlfriend considers this a form of cheating, and the author was aware of previous boundaries (they said they don't want more than friendship), then maybe the author isn't entirely innocent. However, the act itself is quite minor and could be a misunderstanding. The girlfriend's reaction is also significant here; if she's not communicated her boundaries clearly, part of the blame could be on her.\n\nIn the end, the answer depends on the relationship's context and how both parties view boundaries. Since the question is whether the author is the asshole, considering the provided info, the author didn't have malicious intent, but the action did hurt their girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid in her own right. It's a bit of a toss-up, but since the author didn't mean to cross a line, but the girlfriend felt wronged, it's a situation where both sides have valid points. But technically, the author might not be in the wrong if the intent was purely friendly. Alternatively, if the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with such actions, the author might be at fault for not respecting her feelings. The scenario doesn't mention prior communication from the girlfriend about this, so maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
