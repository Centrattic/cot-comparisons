We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend who called it \"minor cheating.\" The situation is that they've been friends a long time, meet occasionally, and are clear about being just friends. The girlfriend feels it's cheating because liking the photo implies attraction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is female, and they've been friends a long time. They've met every 1.5 months, so not super frequent. The main issue is the like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction, leading to the claim of cheating.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the relationship dynamics. The girlfriend's perspective is that any sign of attraction towards someone else is cheating. But traditionally, cheating involves a physical or emotional affair. Liking a photo might be seen as a boundary issue, but it's not a physical act. The key here is whether the couple has established boundaries about social media interactions. If they haven't discussed it before, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity. However, the author's actions were a like, which is a common social media interaction. Since they've been clear about being just friends, the author might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's interpretation is subjective, but the author's action itself is neutral unless they had prior agreements. So, the answer might be B, No.\n"
