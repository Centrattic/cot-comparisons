We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation. The author, a guy, has a female friend who's been a friend for a long time. They meet occasionally, and they both have made it clear that there's no romantic interest. He liked a photo of her in a bikini on Facebook, and his girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The friends have been clear that they only see each other as friends. They meet infrequently, and their interactions are platonic. The act in question is a Facebook like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction, leading her to feel cheated on. But the author argues that liking photos is a common thing among friends, and it's not intentional to cause harm.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and relationships. In many relationships, boundaries are important. Jealousy can sometimes stem from insecurity or past experiences. The author didn't have any prior issues with his girlfriend, so maybe this is a new situation for her. The key points here are consent and mutual understanding. The friends had agreed there's no romantic interest, so the act of liking a photo might not be a breach of that agreement unless there's an explicit boundary against it.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention on a friend's photo could be seen as flirtatious. But in reality, people often like each other's photos without romantic intent. The problem here might be more about the girlfriend's interpretation rather than the action itself. That said, if the action made the girlfriend feel hurt or disrespected, the author might need to consider her feelings even if he sees it as harmless.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. He's been friends for a long time, and the interaction is purely friendly. The act of liking a photo is a common social media gesture. Unless there was a prior agreement not to do so, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the fact that his girlfriend is upset might mean he should have been more cautious to avoid hurt feelings, even if unintentionally.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's belief that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" suggests she might have trust issues or fear of losing him. The author's actions didn't involve direct interaction beyond a like, which is passive. It's possible the girlfriend overreacted, but the author could have communicated better to reassure her.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was likely not intentionally harmful, and given the context of their friendship, he's not in the wrong. The issue is more about the girlfriend's interpretation and the need for better communication between the couple to address her insecurities.\n"
