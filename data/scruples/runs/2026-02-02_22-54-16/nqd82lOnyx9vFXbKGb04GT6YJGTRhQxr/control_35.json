We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as his girlfriend called it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They have a long-term friendship, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. The friend posted a photo in a bikini, and the user liked it. The girlfriend feels that liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the nature of their relationship with the friend, the act of liking the photo, and the girlfriend's perspective. The user claims it's just a friendly gesture, but the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of physical attraction. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the user's intention was innocent, the girlfriend feels hurt. The user's girlfriend might feel insecure or think that liking such a photo crosses a boundary. But the user argues that this is a platonic friendship and that liking photos is part of their usual interaction.\n\nCheating typically involves emotional or physical infidelity. Liking a photo isn't a physical act, but if it's leading to emotional issues in the relationship, it might be a problem. However, it's subjective. The user might not be in the wrong if their actions were intended to be friendly, but the issue is the girlfriend's perception. \n\nThe question is whether the user is the asshole (AITA). The user isn't physically cheating, but if their actions, even unintentionally, make their partner uncomfortable and are interpreted as cheating, does that make them wrong? It's possible the user isn't aware of the emotional impact. \n\nIn some cases, respecting the partner's feelings is necessary even if the action seems minor. But if the user's actions are within the bounds of their agreed-upon friendship and they didn't have ill intent, it might not be their fault. However, the girlfriend's feeling that \"female friends\" inevitably lead to romantic feelings might be a red flag about her trust issues rather than the user's actions. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the relationship dynamics. If the user's actions don't violate any boundaries they've set, maybe it's not their fault. But if the girlfriend's insecurity is valid and they need to adjust their behavior to respect her feelings, then the user might need to consider that. However, if the boundaries are clear and the user followed them, then they aren't wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation. The user didn't act with intent to harm, and the friendship was agreed to be platonic. However, the girlfriend's interpretation is valid as her feelings matter. But the user isn't necessarily wrong if their actions were innocent. The real issue might be communication between the couple.\n"
