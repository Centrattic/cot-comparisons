We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by liking a bikini photo of a female friend, which his girlfriend considers minor cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have clarified that their relationship is purely platonic. They both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. The friend posted a photo during a trip, and the author liked it, which he does regularly.\n\nThe girlfriend interprets this like as a sign of attraction or a step towards cheating. She believes that any close relationship with the opposite sex could lead to cheating. The author thinks she's being unfair.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries in relationships and how partners perceive actions. The author's action is a simple like on social media, which many people do without any romantic intent. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that even small gestures can be problematic if they're seen as showing attraction. \n\nI need to determine if the author's action is objectively wrong or if it's more about differing expectations. The author didn't act with the intent to be inappropriate; he's maintaining a friendship as they've always done. The girlfriend's discomfort stems from her own insecurities or beliefs about relationships. \n\nIn relationship dynamics, what's considered appropriate can vary. If both partners had discussed boundaries beforehand, maybe the girlfriend would have expressed her concerns. However, the author didn't do anything that breaks their agreed-upon boundaries. He didn't engage beyond a like, didn't send messages, and their friendship is established as non-romantic.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that even a like is crossing a line because it's a public gesture that could be misinterpreted, especially with a bikini photo. But the author's history with the friend shows no signs of romantic interest, and the action itself is common. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It seems like the issue is more about the girlfriend's interpretation rather than the author's action. Unless there were prior explicit boundaries against liking photos, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies in communication between the couple about what each considers appropriate.\n"
