We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend who calls it \"minor cheating.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend is a long-time friend, they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't want a romantic relationship. They like each other's posts on Facebook. The friend posted a bikini photo while traveling, and the person liked it. The girlfriend interprets this like as a sign of attraction and considers it cheating.\n\nThe main issue here is whether liking a friend's photo, especially one where they're in a bikini, is inappropriate in a committed relationship. The girlfriend's perspective is that even a simple like can indicate attraction and breach trust. The author thinks it's unfair.\n\nI should consider relationship boundaries. In many relationships, partners agree on what's acceptable in terms of interactions with others. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable with the likes, even if the author doesn't see it as a big deal, the key is mutual respect. The fact that they've established they're just friends might not be enough if the actions still cause insecurity.\n\nAlso, the context of liking other posts versus this particular one. If the author likes other photos too, maybe the bikini photo is the trigger here. The girlfriend might see it as objectifying her partner or showing attraction to another person, which can be a breach of trust even without physical contact.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that it's just a like and part of their usual interaction. But in relationships, perception matters. If the action causes distress, even if unintended, it's important to address it. The girlfriend's feeling that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" suggests deeper insecurities about the author's loyalty or past experiences.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the agreed-upon boundaries in their relationship. If the girlfriend has communicated this as an issue and the author continued, then it's a breach. But if the author didn't intend any harm and the girlfriend is overreacting, maybe the issue is more about her insecurity than his action. However, in relationship terms, actions that hurt the partner's feelings are generally a problem regardless of intent.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because even though the action seems small, it's causing significant emotional distress. The responsibility is to respect the partner's feelings and adjust behavior to maintain trust.\n"
