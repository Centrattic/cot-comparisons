We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as his girlfriend considers it a form of cheating. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The friend in question is someone he's known for a long time, they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts, so this isn't an isolated incident.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating. She believes that any friendship between a man and a woman will inevitably lead to one having more feelings. The user feels this is unfair.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationship boundaries. In many relationships, what's considered a boundary varies. Some couples are more open to friends liking each other's posts, especially if they're just friends. However, others might see it as crossing a line, especially if the friend is in a revealing photo. The key factors here are mutual understanding and communication between the couple.\n\nThe author's actions alone don't necessarily indicate wrongdoing. Liking a friend's photo isn't inherently cheating unless both parties have agreed otherwise. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because she feels hurt and sees it as a boundary issue. The problem might stem from a lack of clear communication about what's acceptable in the relationship.\n\nIf the couple hasn't discussed these boundaries beforehand, the author might not be in the wrong, but he should consider his girlfriend's feelings. Conversely, if they had agreements about not engaging with other people in certain ways, then he might be at fault. Since the scenario mentions that they do like each other's posts regularly, it seems like the girlfriend is newly interpreting this as a boundary breach, which could indicate her own insecurities rather than the author's actions being malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the relationship's specific boundaries. Since the user hasn't violated any prior agreements and the girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from personal feelings rather than established rules, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, open communication is key to resolving this.\n"
