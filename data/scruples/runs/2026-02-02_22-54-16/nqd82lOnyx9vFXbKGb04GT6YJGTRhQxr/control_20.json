We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he liked a photo of his female friend on Facebook where she's in a bikini. His girlfriend is calling it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, the author and this friend have been friends for a long time. They meet occasionally, like once every 1.5 months. They hang out doing normal friend stuff\u2014movies, burgers, beer, chatting. They've both explicitly said they don't want anything more than friendship. So their relationship is pretty clear in their minds. \n\nHe usually likes her posts, including this one where she's in a bikini. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating. Her point is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without romantic feelings, and this leads to cheating.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the context of their friendship, the nature of the action (a like on a photo), and the girlfriend's perception. \n\nIn many relationships, boundaries are important. Even if the author didn't have any intention beyond friendship, the girlfriend is interpreting the like as a sign of attraction. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's insecurities or how she perceives social media interactions. However, the author might not have considered how his actions could be perceived, even if they were innocent. \n\nBut since the author and the friend have clarified their boundaries and there's no history of attraction, the act of liking a post might not be inherently wrong. However, in relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable, the author should have been more mindful of her feelings. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the action itself is wrong. The author didn't have malicious intent, but the girlfriend's reaction is based on her interpretation. So it's a bit of a gray area. Depending on the relationship dynamics, the author might not be in the wrong, but he could be expected to adjust his behavior to respect his girlfriend's feelings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible the girlfriend's reaction is over the top, but in a relationship, actions that make the partner uncomfortable can be problematic even if unintended. So maybe the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend is projecting her insecurities, then the author might not be wrong. But if the action, regardless of intent, is something that the girlfriend sees as crossing a boundary, then maybe the author is in the wrong. \n\nBut since the author and the friend have a clear, non-romantic relationship, and the like is a common social media interaction, the author might not be in the wrong. The issue is more about the girlfriend's perception. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
