She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and planning to move in with the author without a solid financial plan.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about their financial future. They want her to get a job instead of relying on her parents and on affiliate marketing through her Instagram. The author points out the practical issues, like how after rent and bills, there's not much left, and that she might expect him to cover expenses. He also mentions that her friends are in similar situations, which might be a factor in her mindset.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she feels criticized. She's graduating with a master's but hasn't worked before. The author's tone comes across as dismissive of her plans, even calling her posts about \"posting pics of her ass and tits.\" That part seems harsh and possibly disrespectful. The author's intention is to push for financial responsibility, which is valid, but the way he communicated it might have been hurtful.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author has a valid point about financial independence and planning. However, the approach taken\u2014publicly calling her out on Reddit, criticizing her aspirations, and using a derogatory comment about her Instagram content\u2014might be part of the problem. Relationships require communication and support, and while pushing for responsibility is okay, doing so in a way that makes her feel like a failure could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe girlfriend's situation is complicated. She's transitioning from a life of financial support to independence, which is challenging. The author's role is to support her through that transition, not to belittle her efforts. The comment about her Instagram posts is particularly problematic as it's disrespectful and undermines her potential. Even if the author thinks she's not making enough from affiliate marketing, the way he conveyed that message was harsh.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author is right to be concerned about financial planning, but the manner in which he expressed his concerns was hurtful and disrespectful. That makes the answer more nuanced. However, the question is whether he's \"in the wrong.\" Since the core issue is about the approach rather than the intent, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the disrespectful communication.\n"
