She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The context is that she's about to finish her master's, has never worked a job, and relies on her parents' allowance. He wants her to get a job instead of relying on affiliate marketing through Instagram, which he seems skeptical about. She got upset, feeling judged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. He's advocating for financial responsibility, which is a valid concern. She's transitioning from a life without work to moving in together, which requires shared responsibilities. His points about financial stability and not relying on her parents' allowance make sense, especially for a long-term relationship. However, his approach might have come off as harsh or judgmental. He called her out for not working, implying she's a \"bum,\" and criticized her friends for not being in the \"real world.\" That could be hurtful, even if his intentions are good.\n\nOn the other hand, she's at a crossroads. Her plan to rely on Instagram and allowance might not be sustainable. He's trying to prepare her for reality, but the way he communicated it might have been lacking empathy. The key here is whether his criticism was constructive or just harsh. He did express concern about their financial future together, which is reasonable. However, the tone and choice of words might have contributed to her feeling attacked rather than supported.\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters. Even if the message is valid, how it's delivered affects the outcome. He could have approached it with more understanding, perhaps discussing her goals in affiliate marketing and exploring how realistic they are together. Instead, he made her feel like a failure, which isn't helpful. So while his concerns are valid, his method of expressing them might be where he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, if the focus is on his valid concerns despite the delivery, maybe B. But given the emotional impact and the way he dismissed her plans, A could be correct.\n"
