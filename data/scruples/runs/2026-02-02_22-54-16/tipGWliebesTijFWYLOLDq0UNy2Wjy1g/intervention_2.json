She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to finish her master's, has never had a job, and is getting a significant allowance from her parents. The guy wants her to get a job and not rely on her parents' money when they move in together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy is concerned about their financial stability and independence. He's earning 70k this year, but he's not willing to cover her expenses. He's asking her to take responsibility, which seems reasonable. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum\" and dismissed her plans for affiliate marketing. That could be where the problem lies.\n\nThe girlfriend is transitioning from a sheltered life with financial support to living independently. His approach might have been well-intentioned, but the delivery could have been more supportive. Instead of making her feel like she's a burden, maybe he should have discussed practical steps together. He also made a comment about her using her body for Instagram, which could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of her intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy has valid points about financial responsibility. It's important for both partners to contribute to living expenses. The question is whether his approach was wrong. While his intentions might be good, the method of communication and the harsh words could have caused unnecessary hurt. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the way he delivered his message, even if the content had merit. People often need empathy and support when discussing sensitive topics like financial independence. The criticism should be constructive, not belittling. The fact that she got upset and felt devalued suggests that the approach wasn't effective or respectful.\n"
