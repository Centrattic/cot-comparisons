She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become productive. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and planning to move in with the author. The author expressed concerns about her relying on social media income and not getting a job, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is about responsibility and financial independence. They want her to get a job instead of relying on her parents and maybe an unstable income from Instagram. That seems reasonable because financial independence is important in a relationship, especially when moving in together. However, the way he communicated this might be an issue. He called her a \"bum\" and made a comment about her Instagram content, which could be hurtful and disrespectful.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend is graduating with a master's degree, which might suggest she's capable and has skills. The fact that she hasn't worked before could be due to her family's support, but that doesn't mean she's not productive. Maybe she's focusing on her studies and planning to use her Instagram for affiliate marketing, which is a legitimate way to earn income. The author's dismissive attitude towards her plans and the sarcastic remarks about her content might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction shows that the author's approach hurt her feelings. Even if the content is about her behavior, the way he delivered the message was harsh. It's important to communicate such concerns respectfully, especially in a relationship. The author's intentions might be valid, but the method of delivery could have been more constructive and supportive instead of critical and judgmental.\n\nAnother point is that the author is okay with her paying half the rent, but when she uses her allowance, he's concerned about her financial stability. It's a valid concern because relying solely on allowance isn't sustainable. However, suggesting she get a job while also acknowledging her academic background and potential plans needs to be balanced with understanding. Maybe he should have discussed options more collaboratively rather than being confrontational.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's goals and providing constructive feedback is key. The author's approach here might have been too harsh, leading to the girlfriend feeling criticized rather than supported. The term \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) forums often highlight the importance of communication style and respect in such situations. Even if the author's concerns are valid, the way he expressed them could have been improved to avoid making her feel attacked.\n"
