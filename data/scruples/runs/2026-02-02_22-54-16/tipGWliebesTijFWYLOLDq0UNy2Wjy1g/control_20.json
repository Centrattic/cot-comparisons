She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves him advising his girlfriend to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and social media for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's degree but has no work experience. Her family is financially stable, giving her a $1k+ allowance. She plans to move in with him, paying half the rent, but she's relying on her parents' money and IG for income. The author is concerned she's not being realistic and might not have enough left after expenses.\n\nHe expressed his concerns, suggesting she get a job. She took offense, feeling he called her a \"bum.\" The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a general perspective, it's important to validate both sides. The author is voicing a practical concern about their financial future together. It's reasonable to discuss financial responsibilities in a relationship, especially when planning to live together. However, the way he communicated this might have been harsh. Using terms like \"bum,\" pointing out her body in a derogatory way (\"pics of her ass and tits\"), and implying she's not responsible could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful.\n\nHe might have good intentions, but the delivery and some of the comments (especially about her Instagram content and friends) could come across as condescending. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that his tone hurt her feelings. In relationships, how criticism is delivered matters a lot. Even if the concerns are valid, the approach can affect the other person's emotional well-being.\n\nAdditionally, the author's assumption that his girlfriend should work a minimum wage job might not consider her qualifications (she has a master's degree). She might be looking for a job in her field, which isn't mentioned here. It's possible he didn't explore that angle, leading to an oversimplified solution.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's approach of relying on her parents and affiliate marketing might not be sustainable. The author is trying to prepare her for real-world financial responsibilities, which is important for their future together. However, his communication style seems to lack empathy and understanding, which could damage their relationship.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the content of his message or the manner of delivery is more significant. If the advice is valid but delivered poorly, the author might be in the wrong. If the advice is both valid and the delivery is neutral, he's not. Here, the language he used (\"bum,\" \"dick,\" \"not in the real world\") seems harsh and disrespectful. The criticism about her Instagram content also adds an element of judgment that's unnecessary. \n\nTherefore, even if his intentions were good, the way he expressed them likely hurt her feelings unnecessarily. The girlfriend's emotional reaction indicates that his approach was harmful. In relationships, especially when discussing such sensitive topics as financial independence, communication should be constructive and respectful. The author's response crossed that line by using derogatory terms and making her feel criticized.\n"
