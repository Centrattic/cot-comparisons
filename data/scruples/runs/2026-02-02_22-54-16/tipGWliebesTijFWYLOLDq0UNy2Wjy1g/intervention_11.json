She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become more productive. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and planning to move in with him while using her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial responsibility. He wants her to get a job instead of relying on family money and social media. He's right that a full-time job at minimum wage would add to her income. But maybe he came across as harsh. He criticized her friends and her approach, which might have hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is graduating with a master's degree but hasn't worked. Moving in together with financial contributions is a big step, and his concerns are valid about sustainability. However, the way he expressed his concerns\u2014calling her a \"bum\" and making comments about her content\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nIs it wrong to push someone to be more responsible? Maybe not entirely, but the method matters. The author's tone seems confrontational, which could be why she reacted negatively. The question is whether his intentions were right but the delivery wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key factors are intentions and impact. The author's intent was to encourage responsibility, but the impact was hurtful. So while his concerns are legitimate, the way he communicated them might make him partially at fault. However, he's not entirely wrong for wanting her to be independent. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The author's approach could have been more supportive. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, maybe the answer is B because he's advocating for responsibility, but the way he did it is part of the issue.\n"
