She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and planning to move in together where she'd pay half the rent using her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. The author is concerned she's not being realistic and wants her to get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is being practical, pointing out the financial instability of relying on an allowance and potential income from social media. They're worried about their partner not understanding the real-world financial responsibilities, which is a valid concern. It's good that they're thinking about the future and want both partners to be financially responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach might come off as harsh. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or implying their current plans aren't viable without supporting evidence could be hurtful. The girlfriend might feel criticized for her lifestyle, especially if she's been supported by her family financially. The comment about her Instagram content being just pictures of her body could be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of her efforts.\n\nThe key points here are communication style and respect. Even if the author's intentions are good, the way they conveyed their concerns might have been too direct or hurtful. The girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests that the message wasn't received well, possibly due to the delivery rather than the content. It's important to address issues in a supportive manner that encourages growth without making the other person feel attacked.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's background, she might not have had the same experiences as the author, so her perspective is shaped by her environment. The author's friends all have wealthy families and may not have faced the same financial pressures. The author is trying to bridge that gap, but the approach needs to be more empathetic.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to balance honesty with kindness. The author is right to encourage financial independence, but the method of communication could be improved. Instead of calling her a \"bum\" or making sarcastic remarks about her Instagram, the author could have discussed the financial realities in a more collaborative way, perhaps exploring options together for her to find a job or diversify her income.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are reasonable, the execution might be where they went wrong. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because of the harsh communication style and lack of respect in their approach.\n"
