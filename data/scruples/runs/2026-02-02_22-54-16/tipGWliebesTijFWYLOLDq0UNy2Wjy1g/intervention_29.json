She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, who's about to finish her master's degree. She's never had a job before and gets a $1k+ monthly allowance from her well-off parents. They're planning to move in together, and the author expects her to pay half the rent and bills. She says she'll use her parents' money and expand her Instagram (which has 8k followers) to make money via affiliate marketing. The author thinks she should get a job instead, even a minimum wage one, to have a stable income and avoid living paycheque to paycheque. He's worried she'll expect him to cover the costs if she can't afford it. He also mentions that her lifestyle and her friends' lifestyles (who don't work) might be why she's not seeing the reality. The girlfriend got upset, feeling he's judging her and calling her a bum. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. He's concerned about financial responsibilities when moving in together. It's reasonable for him to expect his partner to be able to cover her share of the expenses. He's pointing out the potential instability of relying on her parents' allowance and affiliate marketing, which might not be reliable. He's not necessarily being mean, but he's being realistic. He also mentions that he's on track to make $70k, but he's not willing to cover her shortfalls. That's fair because people in a relationship should be financially independent, especially when living together.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her aspirations and current plans are valid. Starting with affiliate marketing and using her Instagram might be a path she's considering. The author's criticism about her not having a job and relying on her family could come off as dismissive of her efforts and future plans. Also, the comment about her posting pictures of her body might be seen as condescending, even if he's trying to be realistic. It's possible that his approach was harsh, and he could have been more supportive of her goals while still discussing the financial concerns.\n\nThe key points here are communication style and the actual financial concerns. The author has valid concerns about financial responsibility, but the way he expressed them might have been hurtful. He accused her of being a \"bum\" and made a judgmental remark about her content. That could have been unnecessary. A better approach might have been to discuss the financial risks and suggest alternatives without belittling her. The girlfriend's feelings of being judged are valid, even if the underlying concerns are reasonable.\n\nSo, the author is partly right in his concerns but may have handled the situation poorly. The question is whether being right about the financial aspect justifies his harsh approach. If someone is being supportive but realistic, they might still be in the right. However, if the method of communication is hurtful and dismissive, that could place some blame on the author. The answer might be a mix, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the author's intentions were to address real issues but his delivery was harsh, there's a possibility he's in the wrong for how he expressed his concerns rather than the content. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the way he communicated, even if the content had valid points.\n"
