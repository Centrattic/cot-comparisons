She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The guy is concerned about financial responsibility and stability. His girlfriend is moving in with him, and he wants her to contribute by getting a job. He's worried she's not realistic about her finances and that she might expect him to cover everything if she relies on her parents and affiliate marketing. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is graduating with a master's degree but hasn't worked, supported by her family. She has a plan, albeit maybe unrealistic, to use Instagram for income. The author's comments were direct and maybe harsh, especially the part about her posting certain content. That could be hurtful. \n\nI should think about whether pushing someone to be more responsible is wrong. It's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute to shared expenses. However, the way he communicated it led to her feeling belittled. The tone and the specific comments about her content might have crossed a line. \n\nAlso, considering their relationship, they've been together almost a year and this is a significant life decision. The author's approach might have been too confrontational, not allowing for a constructive discussion. Maybe he didn't consider her feelings or her perspective on her future.\n\nIn relationships, support is key. While he's right about the need for financial stability, the method of addressing it matters. The girlfriend's reaction shows that his message made her feel attacked. So, the content of the message (urging responsibility) might be valid, but the delivery was poor. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting her to be productive, but the way he handled it could be problematic. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since the main issue is the communication style, maybe the answer is A. But some might argue that he's not wrong in the content of his message. It's a bit tricky. The key point is that while his intentions are good, the approach was hurtful. So, perhaps he is in the wrong for the way he communicated it, not the message itself.\n"
