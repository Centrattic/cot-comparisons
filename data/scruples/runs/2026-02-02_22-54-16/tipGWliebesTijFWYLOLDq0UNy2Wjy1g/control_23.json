She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy questioning his girlfriend's decision to move in with him without a job, relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to get her master's but has never worked. Her family is wealthy, giving her $1k+ a month. She wants to move in with him, paying half the rent, but she plans to use her parents' money and expand her Instagram for income. He tells her she needs a job to be responsible, mentions she might struggle financially, and questions her content (posts of her body), leading to her feeling upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, he's concerned about financial responsibility. It's reasonable for him to want her to have a stable income, especially if they're moving in together. He's right to point out that relying solely on allowance and an uncertain income stream (Instagram) might not be sustainable. He's also being honest about his expectations, which is important in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the way he delivered the message might have been hurtful. Calling her a \"bum\" or making her feel like an \"asshole\" is harsh. He criticized her aspirations and her friends' lifestyles, which could come off as judgmental. Even if his concerns are valid, the manner in which he communicated them could have been more supportive. Instead of making her feel attacked, he might have offered encouragement to find a job or balance her Instagram work with traditional employment.\n\nThere's also the aspect of respecting her autonomy. While he's concerned about financial stability, she has the right to make her own choices, even if they differ from his. Pushing her to get a job might be valid, but it's important to approach it collaboratively rather than dismissively. His comments about her Instagram content (\"posts of her ass and tits\") could be seen as undermining her efforts and making her feel disrespected.\n\nConsidering relationship dynamics, communication is key. His intentions might be good\u2014wanting financial responsibility and a stable future\u2014but his approach led to hurt feelings. It's possible he didn't anticipate how his words would affect her. However, the core issue is whether he's in the wrong. If the advice was given in a condescending or belittling way, then he might be at fault. But if the concern was valid and the criticism was just poorly delivered, the answer might be different.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a balance between supporting someone's choices and encouraging practical steps. It's not wrong to advocate for financial independence, but how that's communicated matters. If the criticism leads to a breakdown in communication and hurt feelings, that's a problem. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing valid concerns, but the way he did it could be seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's concerns are valid, but his delivery was harsh and hurtful. Therefore, he might be at fault for how he communicated his expectations rather than the expectations themselves.\n"
