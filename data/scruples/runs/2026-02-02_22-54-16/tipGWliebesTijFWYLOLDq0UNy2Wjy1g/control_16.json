She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old male in a relationship with a 23-year-old female who's about to finish her master's degree. She hasn't worked a job before and relies on an allowance from her parents. They're planning to move in together, and she expects her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing to cover her half of the rent and bills. The author is pushing her to get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both perspectives. The author's main concern is financial responsibility. He's worried that her current plan isn't sustainable, especially if she's only making money through Instagram, which can be unreliable. He's trying to set realistic expectations about living expenses and not relying on him to cover the costs. His intention seems to be about preparing her for real-world responsibilities, which is a valid concern in a relationship where both partners need to contribute.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being questioned. She's finishing her education and might feel that she has the right to choose her path, even if it's unconventional. The comment about her Instagram posts being \"pics of her ass and tits\" could be a point of contention. Even if it's a blunt way of saying her content isn't substantive, it's a judgmental remark that might come off as condescending. That part could be hurtful and not constructive.\n\nFinancial expectations in a relationship are crucial. The author is right to address the practical side, but the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or that they need to \"move into reality\" could be seen as disrespectful. It's important to approach such discussions with empathy, acknowledging her situation while expressing your own needs.\n\nHer not having a job is a choice given her family's financial support, but if they're moving in together, both should be on the same page about financial contributions. The author's concern about her expecting him to cover the shortfall is valid, but instead of framing it as a criticism of her, he could have suggested working together to find a solution.\n\nThe key points here are communication style and mutual respect. The author's intentions are reasonable, but the delivery might have been lacking in sensitivity. It's possible he's not entirely in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but the manner in which he did so could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable if she felt belittled. In relationships, especially when discussing finances, how you communicate is as important as the message itself.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he's addressing a legitimate financial issue, but his approach could have been more respectful. However, the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. Some might argue that he's right to push for financial responsibility, while others might see his comments as dismissive of her capabilities.\n"

  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author's concern about financial responsibility is valid, but his approach was dismissive and disrespectful. While it's reasonable to discuss practical living expenses and shared responsibilities, criticizing her lifestyle choices in a demeaning way (e.g., calling her a \"bum,\" mocking her content) is harmful. Financial planning in relationships requires collaboration and empathy, not condescension. The author's tone and judgmental language likely exacerbated the conflict rather than fostering a constructive solution.",
