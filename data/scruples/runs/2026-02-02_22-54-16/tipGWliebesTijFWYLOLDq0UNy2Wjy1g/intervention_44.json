She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she needs to become a productive member of society. The girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's degree, hasn't worked a job before, gets an allowance from her parents, and wants to move in with him but plans to rely on her parents' money and Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, the author's concern seems valid. He's worried about their financial stability if she doesn't have a steady job. It's reasonable to expect that living together would require mutual financial responsibility. She's planning to use her parents' allowance and affiliate marketing, which might not be reliable long-term. The author is pushing her to get a job for financial security, which is a common and rational perspective.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The way he communicated his concerns might have come off as dismissive or judgmental. Calling her a \"bum\" or making comments about her Instagram content (like \"posting pics of her ass and tits\") could be hurtful and demeaning. Even if his intentions were good, the tone and choice of words could have contributed to her feeling attacked. Relationships require empathy, and the way he expressed his concerns might have overshadowed the actual message.\n\nHer reaction suggests that she felt criticized and devalued. While the author's points about financial responsibility are valid, the delivery might have been harsh. The key here is whether his criticism was constructive or not. If he focused more on the practical aspects of their shared living situation rather than personal attacks, it might have been received better.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He's not wrong for wanting her to be financially responsible, but the method of conveying that might have been inappropriate. Relationships involve compromise and communication, and this situation highlights a failure in that department. So, while his intentions aren't entirely in the wrong, the way he handled the conversation could be criticized. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of the hurtful communication style, even if the financial advice was sound.\n"
