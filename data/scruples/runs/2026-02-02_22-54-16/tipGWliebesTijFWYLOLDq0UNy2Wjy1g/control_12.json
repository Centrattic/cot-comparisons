She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and planning to use her Instagram for income. The author is pushing her to get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's degree but has never worked. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and the practicality of her relying on her parents and affiliate marketing. He's worried she might end up struggling financially if they move in together. His intention seems to be about responsibility and future stability.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because the author's comments made her feel criticized. She's in a stage where she's transitioning from education to the workforce, and she might be feeling pressure. The author's approach might have come off as harsh, especially mentioning her content on Instagram as just \"pics of her ass and tits,\" which could be seen as condescending or disrespectful. Even if his intentions were good, the delivery might have been hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are the intention versus the impact. The author's concern is valid\u2014financial independence is important. But the way he communicated it might have been insensitive. The girlfriend might need support in taking steps towards independence rather than being criticized. Also, the author's assumption that affiliate marketing is not a valid way to earn income could be a point of contention. While it's less stable than a job, it's not inherently invalid, and dismissing her plan might undermine her efforts.\n\nFinancial independence is a common issue in relationships, but how it's addressed matters. The author's tone and choice of words could have been more constructive. Instead of making her feel like a \"bum,\" he could have discussed practical steps together. The fact that she's moving into a new phase (graduating) and this is a sensitive time adds to the emotional impact of his criticism.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intentions might not be malicious, but the execution was problematic. It's about balancing honesty with empathy. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because feeling criticized can strain a relationship. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but the way he did it could have been better handled. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach was hurtful, even if the underlying concern was reasonable.\n"
