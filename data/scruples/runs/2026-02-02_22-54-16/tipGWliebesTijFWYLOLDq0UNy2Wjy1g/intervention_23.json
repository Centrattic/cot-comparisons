She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The scenario involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and planning to move in with the author. The author is suggesting she get a job instead of relying on her parents and social media for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is going to graduate with a master's but has no work experience. She's getting a monthly allowance from her wealthy family. The author is concerned about financial stability when moving in together. He's pointing out practical issues like being able to cover expenses and the importance of gaining real-world experience. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels criticized. She's relying on her social media for income, which the author dismisses as not substantial. The author's comments about her friends and their lifestyles might have added to the tension. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, advising someone to be financially responsible isn't inherently wrong. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have come off as harsh or disrespectful. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt, which suggests that the approach could have been more empathetic. The author's mention of her body in the context of her income could be seen as objectifying, which might be a point against him. \n\nBut considering the financial responsibilities of moving in together, the author is justified in wanting a stable arrangement. The core issue is whether the advice given was valid versus how it was delivered. The author's intentions are reasonable, but the method might have been insensitive. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, encouraging financial independence is positive. However, the criticism of her lifestyle and friends might be unfair. The author could have approached the conversation with more support, acknowledging her aspirations while discussing practical steps. \n\nOverall, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting his partner to be financially responsible. The problem lies in the delivery of the message, which could have been more considerate. So the answer is B (No), but with the caveat that the approach could improve.\n"
