She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple discussing moving in together, and the man is concerned about his girlfriend not having a job and relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The man is worried about financial stability. His girlfriend is graduating with a master's degree but hasn't worked a job. She plans to use her Instagram (8k followers) for affiliate marketing and her parents' allowance to cover rent and bills. He's pushing her to get a job, which he sees as a more stable income. He's concerned that without a job, she might not be able to save money and might rely on him, even though he's earning well. He also made a comment about her using her appearance on Instagram, which she took as an insult.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels hurt and called a \"bum.\" She might feel that her plan is valid, and that her partner is being dismissive of her talents and her family's support. The man's comment about her Instagram posts being about her body could be seen as undermining her efforts and could be hurtful, regardless of the truth. Even if he's right about the financial instability, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh.\n\nFinancial independence is important in relationships, and his concerns about shared living expenses are practical. However, the tone and the specific comment about her Instagram content might come off as disrespectful. He's not wrong for wanting her to be financially responsible, but the manner in which he expressed it could be problematic. The key here is whether his intentions were constructive or if he was being condescending.\n\nAlso, considering their relationship, the man is on track for $70k, which is a good income, but he expects her to contribute equally. She's in a unique position where her parents support her, but that might not be sustainable long-term. His push for her to enter the workforce is understandable, but the way he criticized her current plan and made a comment about her body might have been the main issue here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He's right to be concerned about financial stability, but his approach could be seen as hurtful and disrespectful. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the way he communicated his concerns might have damaged their relationship. So, while his intentions might be good, the method and the specific comment about her Instagram posts (which could be seen as objectifying) might make him at fault.\n"
