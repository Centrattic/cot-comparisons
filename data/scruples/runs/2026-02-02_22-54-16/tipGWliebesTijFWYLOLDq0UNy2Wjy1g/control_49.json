She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So the scenario is that the man (M22) is telling his girlfriend (F23) she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram. She's about to finish her master's but hasn't worked before. He's okay with her moving in but insists she should work, not just depend on her parents and affiliate marketing. She got upset, feeling he's being harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective is that she's not being responsible, not working, and he's worried about their financial stability. He's planning to make $70k and doesn't want to support her financially. His criticism is about her not being an adult and relying on friends who are also not working. He's trying to set boundaries for their future together.\n\nOn her side, she's in a masters program, hasn't worked before, and is used to financial support from her family. She's transitioning into the real world and might feel unprepared. Her plan is to use Instagram for income, which he dismisses as just posting certain body parts. That comment could be hurtful and dismissive of her efforts. Also, she's moving out of her family's home, which is a big step, and he's making it conditional on her having a job immediately.\n\nNow, the key points. Is he right to push her to get a job? Financial independence is important, and if they're moving in together, splitting costs fairly makes sense. But his tone and the way he criticized her could be the issue. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or that their efforts are trivial (like calling her Instagram posts about body parts) can be damaging. He might be right in wanting her to be responsible, but his approach might be too harsh. Also, she's in a transition phase, and maybe she needs support in finding a job rather than being told she's not an adult.\n\nAnother angle: the allowance from her parents is $1k+ a month. If she gets a minimum wage job, that could add up. But if she's moving out, splitting the rent, and using her allowance, maybe she doesn't have enough left. His concern about financial stability is valid. However, his comment about her body and friends being in the same boat could be judgmental and not helpful.\n\nIs he wrong for expressing these concerns? Maybe not, but the way he did it might be. He's trying to prepare her for reality, but without empathy. The question is whether his approach was wrong. If he's being supportive in helping her find a job, but instead he's belittling her current situation, that's where he might be in the wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often hinges on whether the criticism was constructive or just harsh without support. Since he's not offering help but instead judging her lifestyle, maybe he's at fault. Also, the part where he says she's not in the real world and her friends aren't either might come off as condescending. He's not wrong to want her to be financially responsible, but the manner in which he delivered it could be the issue. So the answer might be that he's not entirely in the wrong (B), but his approach could use some softening. However, in the context of the question, the options are A (he is in the wrong) or B (not). Given that he's advocating for financial responsibility but in a judgmental way, the answer might be B because his intentions are valid, but the method is questionable. Wait, but does that make him in the wrong? Or is it that the criticism is valid but delivered poorly? In AITA, the community often looks at both intent and impact. So even if the intent is good, if the impact is hurtful, the person might be considered at fault. So in this case, the answer might be A because he's being harsh and judgmental, despite having valid points. However, others might argue that he's right to set boundaries. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given the way he's dismissive of her efforts (calling her Instagram posts about her body) and making her feel like a bum, which caused her to be upset, the community might side that he's in the wrong (A). Alternatively, if they think he's justified in wanting her to be responsible, then B. It's tricky. But considering the emotional impact and the way he phrased things, the answer is likely A.\n"
