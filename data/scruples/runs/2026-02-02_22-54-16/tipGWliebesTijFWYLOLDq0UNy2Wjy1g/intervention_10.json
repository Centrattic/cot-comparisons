She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The key points here are the relationship dynamics, financial expectations, and communication.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend is about to finish her master's degree but hasn't worked a job before. She's receiving a substantial allowance from her wealthy parents. She plans to use this allowance to cover half the rent and bills when moving in, and rely on Instagram affiliate marketing for the rest. The author, on the other hand, is earning around $70k this year and renting an apartment alone. He's pushing for her to get a job, emphasizing financial responsibility and independence.\n\nNow, the author's intention seems to be about setting realistic expectations for their future together. He's concerned that relying on her parents and Instagram might not be sustainable, and he wants her to take responsibility for her finances. However, the way he communicated this might have come off as harsh. He called her a \"bum,\" criticized her friends' lack of real-world experience, and made a comment about her using \"pics of her ass and tits,\" which is not respectful and could be hurtful.\n\nFinancial discussions in relationships can be tricky. While the author has valid concerns about financial stability and shared responsibility, his approach might have been confrontational. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt attacked, which is understandable. It's important to encourage each other towards goals without undermining the other's efforts or self-esteem.\n\nThe author's advice about getting a job is sound, but the delivery and the derogatory remarks about her potential income source (Instagram) are problematic. Everyone has different paths to success, and affiliate marketing can be a legitimate income stream, though it's true that it requires effort and might not be as stable as a regular job. However, dismissing her plans in that way isn't helpful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is right to address financial planning, especially if they're moving in together. However, the way he did it\u2014publicly on a forum like Reddit with a confrontational tone\u2014might not be the best approach. Open, respectful communication is key in such situations. Instead of making her feel like a \"bum,\" he should have discussed his concerns in a more supportive manner, offering to help her explore options or setting clear expectations for their shared financial responsibilities.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are understandable, his methods and the language used were inappropriate. The judgment here is whether the means justify the message. Since the message is valid but the delivery caused harm, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong for the way he communicated his concerns, even if the concerns themselves are reasonable.\n"
