She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the guy is suggesting his girlfriend, who's about to finish her master's, should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. They're planning to move in together, and he's concerned she won't have enough to cover her half of the rent and bills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy is trying to be responsible. He mentions that her current plan might not be realistic\u2014relying on Instagram affiliate marketing and her parents' money. He's pointing out that even with minimum wage, she could have a more stable income. That seems practical, right? He's probably trying to avoid future financial strain on both of them.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend might feel criticized. She's graduating, which is a big achievement. She might see her plan as viable, especially if she has a decent following. The guy's comment about her content (posts of her body) could have come off as dismissive or belittling, even if he was trying to be honest. That might have hurt her feelings.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he's voicing his concerns about their financial future, which is reasonable. But the way he communicated it might have been harsh. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" isn't helpful. Also, the comment about her content could be seen as disrespectful. Maybe there's a balance between being practical and being supportive. He might have a valid point about financial responsibility, but his approach might have been lacking in empathy. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how he handled the situation. But according to the options, it's either A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). Since his intentions were good but the delivery could be better, I'm leaning towards B, but unsure. However, considering that he's advocating for financial responsibility and she's being realistic about their situation, maybe B is correct. The key is whether his approach was wrong. If the problem is the tone and the specific comment about her content, then maybe A. But the question is about if he's in the wrong for telling her to be productive. Since he's encouraging her to work, which is reasonable, the answer might be B. But the comment about her body posts could tip it to A. Hmm. I think the core issue is his concern is valid, but the way he expressed it wasn't. So maybe he's not in the wrong for the main message, but the method was problematic. Since the question is about the act of telling her to be productive, which is not wrong, the answer is B. The specific comment about her content is a separate issue but doesn't negate the main point.\n"
