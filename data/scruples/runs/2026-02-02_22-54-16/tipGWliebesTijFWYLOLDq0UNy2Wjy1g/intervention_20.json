She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The man is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's and has never worked before. Her parents give her a $1k monthly allowance. They're planning to move in together, and he's okay with her paying half the rent. But when she says she'll use her allowance and expand her Instagram for income, he pushes back, saying she should get a job. He mentions she might not have enough left after bills and expresses concerns that she expects him to cover other expenses. She got upset, feeling he called her a bum.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, he's being realistic about financial responsibilities. Living together typically means splitting costs, and relying on an allowance plus social media income might not be stable. He's trying to set realistic expectations, which is responsible. On the other hand, his approach might be harsh. Telling her she's not an adult and calling her a bum could be hurtful. He might not have considered her feelings or the pressure she's under. Also, she's transitioning from a life of financial support, so expecting her to immediately get a job might be stressful. The tone and choice of words matter here. Even if his concerns are valid, how he communicated them might have been unkind. So, while he's right to address the practical aspects, the way he did it could be seen as insensitive. Therefore, he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's a part where he could have handled it better. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the main issue is financial responsibility, but the delivery was questionable. However, in AITA questions, the main focus is on intent and whether the action was justified. Since he's addressing a legitimate concern about shared living costs and financial stability, he's probably not in the wrong overall. But the way he framed it as her being a \"bum\" adds a negative tone. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is B, but with a note that his communication could improve.\n"
