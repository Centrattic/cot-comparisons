She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their girlfriend to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and wants their GF to be independent. They're planning to move in together, and they're worried about splitting rent and bills. The GF's plan relies on her parents' money and potentially unstable income from Instagram.\n\nOn the other hand, the GF is graduating with a master's, which might mean she's in a field that requires further education or has different career paths. She might feel that the author is being harsh or not supportive of her chosen method of earning money. The author's comments about her content could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, which might hurt her feelings.\n\nI should think about financial independence in relationships. It's reasonable to want a partner to contribute equally, especially when moving in together. However, the way the author communicated their concerns might have been too harsh. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or making comments about their content could come off as insulting rather than helpful.\n\nAlso, considering the GF's background, she might not have had the opportunity to work before, so maybe she's still figuring out her path. The author's push for her to get a job is practical, but maybe they need to approach it with more empathy and support. The key here is whether the author's intentions are valid but their delivery was inappropriate.\n\nFinancial planning is important, and the author is right to be concerned about their future together. However, the way they expressed those concerns might have been too critical, leading to the GF feeling attacked instead of supported. So, whether the author is in the wrong could depend on the balance between their valid concerns and the manner in which they were communicated.\n"
