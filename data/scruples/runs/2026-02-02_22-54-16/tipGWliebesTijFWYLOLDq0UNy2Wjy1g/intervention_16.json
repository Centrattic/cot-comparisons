She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to finish her master's, has never had a job, and relies on her parents' allowance. The author wants her to get a job instead of just using her Instagram for affiliate marketing. She got upset and called him names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that his girlfriend isn't taking responsibility for her financial future and expects him to support her. He's concerned about their future together if she's not working. On the other hand, she relies on her parents and is transitioning from academia to the workforce, which can be challenging. The author's comments about her Instagram content being just \"pics of her ass and tits\" might come off as dismissive or disrespectful, even if his intentions are good.\n\nThe key points here are communication style, expectations in a relationship, and the transition to financial independence. The author is right to encourage her to get a job, as financial dependence on parents isn't sustainable. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh, leading to emotional hurt. The comment about her Instagram content is particularly problematic because it's derogatory and undermines her efforts in a different way. \n\nIn relationships, how you express concerns matters as much as the concerns themselves. Even if the author's intentions are valid, the tone and specific remarks could be seen as disrespectful, which might make him partly at fault. However, the core issue of encouraging financial independence is reasonable. \n\nSo, considering both the content of the message and the delivery, the answer isn't entirely clear. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's main point about needing a job is valid, but the way he delivered it was hurtful, there's a mix here. However, the user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, so I need to weigh the validity of the concern against the delivery.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both the intentions and the impact. The author's intentions are about financial responsibility, which is reasonable, but the impact on his girlfriend was negative. However, since he's trying to set boundaries for their future together, maybe he's in the right. Alternatively, the way he criticized her could be seen as condescending, especially commenting on her body in that way. That might tip the scales towards him being in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards the author being in the right in terms of the message but the delivery is poor. But in AITA terms, maybe the delivery matters more because it caused harm. So the answer might be a mix, but according to the user's initial thought, they think the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide between A and B. Given that the main issue is the validity of the concern versus the harsh delivery. In AITA, the community often values the intention but also the way it's handled. The author's comment about her Instagram content is a clear issue. That's probably the key point. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because of that specific comment, which is derogatory, even if the main point is valid. Alternatively, if the main point is valid, maybe B. It's a tough call. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The answer might depend on how much weight is given to the delivery versus the message.\n"
