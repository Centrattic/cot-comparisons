She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is graduating with a master's degree but hasn't had a job before. She's getting an allowance from her family, which is pretty substantial (dentist and accountant parents). She wants to move in with the author, paying half the rent using her allowance and planning to monetize her Instagram with affiliate marketing.\n\nThe author is concerned because relying on allowance and Instagram might not be stable, and they want her to get a real job. The girlfriend got upset, feeling accused of being a bum. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial stability and responsibility. Moving in together would involve shared expenses, and the author is worried that the girlfriend's income plan isn't realistic. They might have a point if relying on allowance and uncertain income (Instagram affiliate marketing) could lead to financial strain. The author is trying to set realistic expectations, which is understandable in a relationship moving towards financial partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is transitioning from a supportive family environment to independence. She might feel that the author is being harsh, criticizing her lifestyle choices. The author's approach might come off as dismissive or condescending, especially when making comments about her content (posts of her body). That part could be seen as disrespectful, which might have contributed to her feeling hurt.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions versus their delivery. While the author's concerns are valid, the way they communicated their concerns\u2014especially the part about her posts\u2014could be seen as belittling. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting financial responsibility, but the manner in which they expressed it could be problematic. However, in relationships, especially when discussing financial matters, the approach matters a lot. The author's comments about her friends and their lifestyles might also imply judgment on her social circle, which could add to the tension.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's main point about financial responsibility isn't unreasonable, but the way they delivered it, including the specific comment about her Instagram content, could be seen as disrespectful. So, there's a mix of valid concerns and poor communication. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized for her choices, which are influenced by her family's support and her social environment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intentions are to ensure financial stability, which is a responsible approach. However, the method of communication could be improved. The answer might hinge on whether the advice was given constructively. Since the author used a confrontational tone and made a comment about her body content, which is a sensitive topic, that could be where they went wrong. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong due to poor communication, but the core concern about financial responsibility isn't invalid. However, the specific comment about her Instagram posts is a significant issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the disrespectful comments and the way the criticism was delivered, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n"
