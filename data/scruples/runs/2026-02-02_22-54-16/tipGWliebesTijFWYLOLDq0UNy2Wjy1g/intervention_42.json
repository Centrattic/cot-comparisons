She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and using her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's girlfriend is graduating with a master's but has never had a job. She's getting a $1k+ allowance from her parents. They're planning to move in together, and she expects to cover half the rent with her allowance and Instagram. The author is against this, feeling she should get a job for financial stability. He mentions she might struggle financially otherwise and that she might expect him to cover expenses. \n\nNow, the author's reasoning: he's concerned about her financial independence and their future stability. He's not wrong to worry about shared responsibilities if they live together. However, the way he communicated this might be an issue. He called her a \"bum\" and made derogatory comments about her Instagram content. That's hurtful and could have made her feel attacked. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being realistic about financial matters. It's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute fairly and to have a stable income. The girlfriend's plan relies on unpredictable income (Instagram affiliate marketing) and parental support, which might not be sustainable. The author's advice is practical, but his delivery was harsh.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The intention is valid (financial responsibility), but the method and tone could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is also valid because the way he expressed his concerns was disrespectful. \n\nIn relationships, communication style matters a lot. Even if the issue is legitimate, how it's presented affects the outcome. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of the content of his message, but the manner in which he delivered it is questionable. However, in AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the action's justification rather than the tone. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his concerns about financial responsibility, even if the delivery was harsh. The core issue is valid: he's advocating for a realistic approach to their shared living situation. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable due to the harsh words, but the author's stance on financial stability isn't wrong.\n"
