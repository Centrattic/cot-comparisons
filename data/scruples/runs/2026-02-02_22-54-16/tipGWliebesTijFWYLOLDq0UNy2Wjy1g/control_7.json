She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's telling his girlfriend to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The guy is concerned about financial responsibility. He's planning for them to move in together, and he wants her to be financially independent. His arguments are about needing a stable income, not relying on social media, and avoiding debt. That makes sense because financial stability is important in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is coming from a supportive family, which might make her less aware of the need to work. She's relying on her allowance and a side hustle via Instagram. The guy's comments about her body and friends being in the same situation could be seen as insensitive. Also, calling her a \"bum\" or an asshole might be harsh, even if his intentions are good.\n\nBut the key points here are about his intentions. He's trying to encourage her to take real steps towards independence. However, how he communicated his concerns might have been hurtful. The way he dismissed her plans for Instagram and made a comment about her content could come off as disrespectful. Even if he's right about the financial advice, the delivery matters in a relationship.\n\nAlso, considering their future together, it's reasonable for him to want her to be self-sufficient. But pushing her too hard without support might not be the best approach. The question is whether his actions were wrong. The main issue is the harshness of his tone and the specific comment about her body, which is unkind and degrading. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the guy has a valid point about financial prudence. But the way he expressed it might have crossed a line. So, the answer might hinge on whether the wrong lies in the message or the delivery. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if the criticism is about the delivery being hurtful, then the author is in the wrong. If it's about the content of the message, he's not. But the combination of valid concerns and hurtful delivery makes it a nuanced case. \n\nMost people would argue that the intention is good, but the method was poor. Therefore, the author's approach was wrong, but not the message itself. However, in relationships, how you communicate is as important as the message. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the hurtful language, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n"
