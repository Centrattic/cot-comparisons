She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become productive. \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to get her master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k+ allowance. They're planning to move in together, and she wants to use her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing to cover her share. He's pushing her to get a job instead.\n\nThe author argues that relying on parents' money and affiliate marketing isn't reliable. He's concerned about financial stability and that she's not preparing for the real world. He also mentions she's expecting him to cover expenses, which he's against. The girlfriend got upset, feeling judged and called a \"bum.\"\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Is it wrong to encourage someone to be financially independent? On one hand, the author is right to want his partner to be self-sufficient, especially if they're moving in together. It's reasonable to expect her to contribute equally. On the other hand, the way he communicated his concerns might have come off as harsh or dismissive. He criticized her plans and implied her friends aren't responsible, which could have hurt her feelings.\n\nFinancial independence is important in a relationship, so his intentions aren't bad. However, the approach matters. Being direct is one thing, but making her feel like a failure might be counterproductive. He could have expressed his concerns without being so judgmental. The key is whether the criticism was constructive or just hurtful.\n\nAlso, her situation: she's from a well-off family, which might make her less experienced with financial management. His push for a job is valid because relying solely on allowance isn't sustainable. But he should consider her feelings and perhaps offer support in finding a job or improving her affiliate marketing.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions stem from a place of wanting a stable future together, which is understandable. However, the manner in which he expressed these concerns could be seen as insensitive. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the balance between his valid concerns and how they were communicated. Since the question is about being in the wrong, it's more about the approach than the intent. So, maybe AITA? The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the intentions are good, but some might argue A (in the wrong) for the way it was said. But in AITA posts, often if the intent is good and the criticism is reasonable, it's seen as not the author's fault. So probably B.\n"
