She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's, has never had a job, gets an allowance from her well-off parents, and wants to move in with him. He's okay with her paying half the rent but is upset that she plans to use her parents' money and her Instagram for income instead of getting a job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that she's avoiding real-world responsibilities by relying on family money and not working. He's concerned about financial stability and wants her to be independent. His reasoning is about financial responsibility and preparing for adulthood. He also mentions that she might expect him to cover expenses if she doesn't work, which he's not willing to do.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is that she feels criticized and devalued. She's planning to use her Instagram, which could be a legitimate source of income, though maybe not as stable as a job. The author's tone comes across as harsh, especially when he mentions her posting pictures and implying that's not a real job. That could be hurtful and dismissive of her efforts. Also, her emotional response\u2014feeling like a \"bum\"\u2014suggests that his words were damaging to her self-esteem.\n\nFinancial independence is a valid concern, but the way it was communicated might be the issue here. Instead of being supportive and discussing practical steps, he came off as critical and judgmental. The author's approach could be seen as lacking empathy, especially since she's transitioning from a sheltered environment to a more independent life. The comment about her Instagram posts being just \"pics of her ass and tits\" is particularly harsh and could contribute to her feeling attacked.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's plan to use affiliate marketing via Instagram isn't impossible, but it's a common source of income for many. However, without a job, relying solely on that might be risky. The author is right to point out the financial instability, but the method of communication matters. Telling someone they're being irresponsible versus having a constructive conversation makes a big difference.\n\nAlso, considering their relationship stage\u2014being in a long-term relationship and planning to move in together\u2014financial discussions should be approached with care and mutual respect. The author's approach might have been too direct and lacking in understanding of her situation and feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about financial responsibility, the way he conveyed them was harsh and hurtful. The key issue here is the approach and communication style rather than the content of the message itself. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the manner in which he delivered his concerns, affecting their relationship negatively.\n"
