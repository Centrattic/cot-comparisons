She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the man is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she needs to become a productive member of society. The situation is that she's about to get her master's, never had a job, gets an allowance, and wants to move in with him but rely on her parents' money and Instagram affiliate marketing.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the man's criticism of her not working. He's concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to get a job. He points out the practical aspects of living costs and saving. But she's offended, feeling he's being harsh and making her feel like a bum.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The man is being honest about his expectations for financial independence in a relationship. Moving in together usually involves shared responsibilities. He's not okay with her relying solely on her parents and affiliate marketing, which he doubts. His concerns are valid; financial stability is important. However, the way he communicated it might be an issue. He called her out for not working, criticized her friends' lifestyles, and made a comment about her using her body for Instagram. That could come off as condescending or dismissive of her aspirations.\n\nOn the other hand, she has the right to pursue her goals, and maybe she's not ready for a traditional job. The man's tone and choice of words might have been harsh, making her feel attacked. Even if his intentions are good, the approach matters. He should have been supportive but realistic, discussing options without belittling her current path.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a mix. He's right to want financial responsibility, but his delivery was possibly hurtful. The answer hinges on the balance between being practical and respecting her autonomy. The comment about her Instagram content is particularly problematic as it's a personal jab. Therefore, while his intentions are understandable, his method was flawed, making him at least partially in the wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. Since his advice is valid but delivered poorly, maybe a B is more accurate, but some might argue A because of the harshness.\n"
