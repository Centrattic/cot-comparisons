She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she needs to become more productive. So, the situation is that the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's but has no job experience. Her parents are wealthy and give her a $1k+ monthly allowance. They want to move in together, and she plans to use her allowance and expand her Instagram (which has 8k followers) for income through affiliate marketing. The guy is against this, pushing her to get a job instead. He thinks relying on allowance and Instagram might not be enough, and he's worried she'll struggle financially. She got upset and accused him of being harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about financial responsibility and wanting his partner to be self-sufficient. He's concerned about their future together if she can't cover her share of expenses. On the other hand, the girlfriend is coming from a family that supports her, and she's trying to leverage her existing platform. The guy's criticism might come off as dismissive of her efforts or her background. He also made a comment about her using Instagram for certain content, which could be seen as condescending or belittling.\n\nFinancial independence is important, but the approach matters. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or that they need to \"move into reality\" might be too harsh. The guy's intention might be valid, but the way he communicated his concerns likely hurt her feelings. He didn't validate her aspirations or consider that she might be trying to find a way that works for her. Also, suggesting that her Instagram efforts are only about certain content could undermine her potential.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of being confrontational, discussing concerns with empathy might be more effective. The author's actions might not be entirely wrong in wanting her to be independent, but the manner in which he expressed it could have been more supportive. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the harsh communication and lack of empathy.\n"
