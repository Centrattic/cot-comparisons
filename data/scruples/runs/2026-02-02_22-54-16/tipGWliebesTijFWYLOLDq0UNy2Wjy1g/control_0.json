She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society.\n\nFirst, the context: The author (M22) is in a relationship with his girlfriend (F23) who's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. She's been supported financially by her parents, getting around $1k a month. They're planning to move in together, and she intends to cover half the rent with her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. The author is against this, insisting she should get a job. He expresses concerns about her financial stability and not wanting to support her if they live together. She got upset, feeling judged and called him names. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider different angles.\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about their financial partnership. He's right to think about practical matters like splitting rent and bills. His argument is that relying on allowance and potentially unreliable income from Instagram isn't sustainable. He's also being honest about his unwillingness to support her financially beyond what's agreed, which is fair. His intention is to encourage her to be financially independent, which is a reasonable expectation in a committed relationship, especially when moving in together. \n\nOn the other hand, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. Telling someone they need to \"move into reality\" and implying they're not an adult can be hurtful. The phrase \"posting pics of her ass and tits\" is especially problematic. It's disrespectful and objectifies her, which could contribute to her feeling belittled. Even if his intentions were good, the tone and language used could be seen as condescending and dismissive of her efforts to find alternative income through her existing platform.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also valid. Feeling like a \"bum\" after being criticized for relying on family support and not having a job might be hurtful, especially if she's in a transitional phase. However, the author's concerns are grounded in practicality. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intentions are about financial responsibility and shared expectations, but the delivery was possibly harsh and disrespectful. The girlfriend's feelings of being judged are justified if the communication wasn't empathetic. However, the author isn't entirely wrong in wanting her to be employed. \n\nIn relationships, especially when discussing financial matters, communication style matters a lot. While the author's core message might be valid, the way he delivered it could be seen as dismissive or hurtful. So, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's more about the approach than the message itself. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his communication was harsh and disrespectful, even if his concerns were valid. Alternatively, it could be B (No) if the message is seen as a legitimate discussion about financial responsibility. \n\nBut given the language like \"posting pics of her ass and tits,\" which is derogatory and undermines her potential, it's likely that the author is in the wrong. The way he framed her goals (affiliate marketing via Instagram) as just about her body is condescending and not supportive. So, Answer A."
