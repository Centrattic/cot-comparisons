She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become productive. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's but has no work experience. She's getting an allowance from her parents and plans to use her Instagram and affiliate marketing to cover the rent. The author is pushing her to get a job because he thinks relying on parents and social media isn't realistic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is about responsibility and real-world expectations. He wants her to be financially independent, which makes sense. But maybe his approach was harsh. He called her a \"bum\" and made her feel bad, which could be hurtful. Communication style matters. Even if his intent was good, the way he expressed it might have been unkind. Also, suggesting that her income from Instagram is just from posting certain content might be dismissive of her potential or passion.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has grown up in a supportive environment with financial help. She might not have had the chance to work yet, and transitioning to living on her own is a big step. The author's concern about financial stability is valid, but maybe he should have been more supportive in helping her find a job or explore other options instead of criticizing her choices.\n\nThere's also the aspect of their relationship dynamics. The author expects her to contribute equally financially, which is fair, but pushing her to get a job without considering her situation might be too much. Maybe he should have discussed practical steps together, like part-time work or internships, instead of just telling her to \"become productive.\"\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. His intentions are good, but his method of communication was harsh. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's encouraging responsibility, but there's room to argue that his approach was insensitive. However, given the context of wanting financial independence, the main issue might be more about how he said it rather than the message itself. Therefore, the answer could lean towards B, but with the note that his delivery was problematic.\n"
