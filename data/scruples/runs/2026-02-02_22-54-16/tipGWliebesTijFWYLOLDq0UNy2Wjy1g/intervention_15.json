She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become productive. He's M22, she's F23, about to get a master's degree but never had a job. Her family gives her $1k+ a month. They're planning to move in together, and she wants to pay half the rent using her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. He's against it, wants her to get a job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy is concerned about financial stability. His girlfriend is relying on family money and social media income, which might not be reliable. He's trying to set realistic expectations. But the way he communicates his concerns might come off as harsh or dismissive, especially calling her friends \"bums\" or making comments about her Instagram content.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is emotional, feeling belittled. He might have valid financial concerns, but the approach could be the issue. Was he right to express his concerns? Yes, but the method might have been too harsh. He could have been more supportive, maybe suggesting practical steps instead of making her feel like a failure. The key is whether his intentions were to help or to criticize. If he's trying to be realistic but his tone was hurtful, he's partly at fault. If he's being mean without considering her perspective, he's definitely in the wrong.\n\nAlso, she's transitioning from a sheltered life to independence. He's pushing her into the real world, which is good, but the way he's doing it might not be supportive. Maybe he should have a more collaborative approach instead of being dismissive of her plans. So, while his intentions might be good, the way he communicated them is problematic. Therefore, he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in his approach. So the answer would be B (No), but with the nuance that his communication could be better.\n"
