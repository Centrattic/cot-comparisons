She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become more productive. The situation is that the girlfriend is graduating with a master's, has never worked, gets a substantial allowance from her parents, and wants to move in with him. She plans to use her Instagram (with 8k followers) for affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. The author is upset about this plan and told her she needs to get a real job. She got upset and accused him of being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 22, his girlfriend is 23. He's working and on track to make 70k, which is a decent salary. The girlfriend's financial situation is that she's been supported by her parents and hasn't had to work for money. Moving in together is a big step, and financial responsibility is a key part of that. The author is concerned about her financial stability and independence, which is valid. He's worried that relying on Instagram and her parents' allowance isn't sustainable, especially if they live together and share expenses. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's plan to use Instagram for affiliate marketing is a legitimate endeavor, albeit with uncertain income. However, 8k followers isn't a huge number, and making a substantial income from that might be challenging. The author's point about her needing a steady income to cover shared expenses is practical. Also, the author isn't willing to financially support her, which is fair since they're moving in together. \n\nThe way the author communicated his concerns might have been harsh. He called her out for relying on her parents and friends who are similarly financially supported, which could have made her feel attacked. Instead of framing it as constructive advice, he might have come off as dismissive or condescending, leading her to feel like a \"bum.\" \n\nFinancial independence is important, especially in a relationship where both partners contribute. However, the approach matters. The author's intentions are understandable, but the method of delivery could have been a mistake. He might not be wrong in his stance that she needs a job, but the way he expressed it may have been hurtful and counterproductive. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely wrong in his expectations, but he could have handled the conversation better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since his advice is practical and his refusal to support her financially is reasonable, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong. But the way he communicated it might have been a misstep. But according to the options, it's either A or B. If the main issue is the approach rather than the content, then B (not in the wrong) might be the answer. But if the problem is his dismissiveness towards her potential income (even if it's risky), then maybe A. Hmm.\n"
