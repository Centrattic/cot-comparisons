She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a 22-year-old male who's been in a relationship with his 23-year-old girlfriend for almost a year. She's about to graduate with a master's degree but has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1,000+ monthly allowance. They're discussing moving in together, and the author wants her to get a job instead of relying on her parents' money and affiliate marketing through her Instagram, which has 8k followers. The GF got upset and called him names, so he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned about financial responsibilities if they move in together. He's on track to earn $70k this year, but he's not willing to cover the other half of the expenses if she can't contribute. She's planning to use her parents' allowance and her Instagram, which he's skeptical about. His arguments are about her being a productive adult, financial stability, and not struggling month to month. On the other hand, she hasn't had to work before, comes from a well-off family, and her friends are in similar situations. The author's tone might have been harsh, especially the part about her making money off \"pics of her ass and tits,\" which could be seen as condescending or hurtful.\n\nNow, the key points here are financial expectations, communication, and respect. The author is setting boundaries, which is understandable, but the way he communicated those might have been insensitive. He called her a \"bum\" and made a comment that could make her feel disrespected. Even if his concerns are valid, the approach matters. The GF's reaction is also significant\u2014she felt attacked and devalued. \n\nIn relationships, especially when discussing finances, it's important to approach the topic with empathy. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting her to have a stable income, but his delivery could be problematic. He should have considered her feelings and maybe suggested alternatives rather than being blunt and judgmental. The part about her parents not being in the real world and her friends might be true, but bringing that up could be seen as belittling her past. \n\nAlso, the author is okay with her contributing half the rent, but he's concerned she's relying on her parents and an uncertain income source (affiliate marketing). It's reasonable to want a partner to be financially independent, but the way he expressed it might have been the issue. The community usually looks at intent and communication style in these scenarios. If he was genuinely concerned about their future and not being dismissive of her efforts, but the delivery was harsh, he might not be in the wrong. However, if he was condescending or not supportive, that could be his fault.\n\nI need to decide if the author's actions were justified. His main point is about her needing to be a \"productive member of society,\" which is a bit of a loaded term. It could imply that she's not contributing enough, but if she's in school and there's no requirement for work, maybe that's not his call to make. Also, suggesting she's not in the real world might be true, but it's important to frame such discussions constructively. The comment about her Instagram content is definitely a red flag. It's unkind and could be seen as criticizing her body or her choices, which is personal and not professional.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's concerns are valid in terms of financial planning, but his communication was lacking in empathy and respect. The GF's reaction shows that his words hurt her, which is a sign that he might have handled it poorly. The community might see that while the topic is important, the way he approached it was wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the harsh and disrespectful way he expressed his concerns, even if the concerns themselves are somewhat reasonable.\n"
