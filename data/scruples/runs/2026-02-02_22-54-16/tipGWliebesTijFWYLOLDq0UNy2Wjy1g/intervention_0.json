She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a guy in a relationship with a girl who's about to get her master's degree but has never had a job. She's getting a decent allowance from her parents and plans to move in with him, paying half the rent by using her Instagram for affiliate marketing. He's against that idea and wants her to get a job instead. She got upset, feeling he's judging her and calling her a bum.\n\nFirst, is he in the wrong? Well, he's concerned about practical aspects. Living together can be tough if one person isn't contributing financially in a stable way. Her relying on allowance and uncertain Instagram income might not be sustainable. He's pointing out real financial issues, which seems responsible. But the way he communicated it might have been harsh. Telling her she's avoiding reality and implying she's a bum could be hurtful, even if his intentions are good.\n\nHe also made a comment about her content, which might be offensive. Even if he's right about her financial plan, the tone and choice of words matter in relationships. She's in a transition phase from student to working, which is a big step. His support is important, but maybe he should have approached it more gently. However, the core issue of financial responsibility is valid. So, is he in the wrong for the approach, or is he right about the substance? It's a mix. If the answer is about whether he's in the wrong morally, maybe he's not in the wrong for the content of his message, but the delivery could have been better. Since the options are A or B, and the user thinks he's not wrong, but the comment about her posts might be an issue. However, overall, the main point is about financial responsibility, which is reasonable. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
