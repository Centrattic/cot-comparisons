She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy telling his girlfriend that she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's, never had a job, gets a $1k+ allowance from her parents (dentist and accountant). She wants to move in with him, paying half the rent. She plans to use her Instagram (8k followers) for affiliate marketing. He's against that and insists she should get a real job. She got upset, feeling he's being harsh and making her feel like a bum.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the guy is concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to be independent. He's worried about their future if she relies on her parents and Instagram, which might not be reliable. On the other hand, he called her a \"bum,\" said she's posting \"pics of her ass and tits,\" which is disrespectful. He dismissed her idea of affiliate marketing and criticized her friends. She's in a position where she hasn't had to work due to her family's support, and suddenly facing criticism might be hurtful.\n\nFactors to consider: Communication style, respect, financial expectations, and the reality of her situation. While the author's intentions might be about responsibility, the way he communicated it was harsh. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" and mocking her content is not constructive. He should have discussed the financial aspects without attacking her character. Also, she's transitioning into the workforce, and his approach might be dismissive of her efforts to find alternative income.\n\nBut it's also valid to expect that moving in together means both contribute financially in a sustainable way. However, the tone and choice of words matter a lot. The criticism about her Instagram content is particularly problematic. People's incomes can come from various sources, and affiliate marketing isn't inherently \"not real.\" His judgmental attitude might be the issue here.\n\nSo, balancing the intention (wanting her to be responsible) against the method (insulting and disrespectful) suggests that the author's approach was wrong. Therefore, he's in the wrong (A).\n"
