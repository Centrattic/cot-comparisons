She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy telling his girlfriend she needs to become a productive member of society, specifically by getting a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The guy (M22) is concerned about financial responsibility. He's renting an apartment by himself and wants her to contribute half the rent. He's worried that if she only uses her parents' allowance and tries to make money through Instagram, they might struggle financially. He's suggesting she get a job, which seems like a reasonable concern for financial stability in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl (F23) is graduating with a master's degree and hasn't had a job before. Her family is financially stable, and she's been given an allowance. She's planning to use her Instagram following (8k followers) for affiliate marketing. The guy's criticism of her relying on friends who also come from wealthy backgrounds and don't work might come across as judgmental. \n\nThe key points here are about expectations in a relationship, financial independence, and communication. The guy's intention is to ensure financial stability, which is valid. However, the way he presented his concerns might have been harsh. Telling her she's a \"bum\" and calling out her friends could have been hurtful. It's possible that his approach was more about expressing his values than considering her feelings or her plans.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. He's not wrong for wanting her to be financially responsible, but his method of communication might have been poor. Relationships require empathy and understanding. If he dismissed her plans without considering her perspective, that's where he might be in the wrong. However, his concern is justified. \n\nThe girl's reliance on her parents' money and her lack of work experience could be an issue, but she might be trying to find a different path. The guy's tone, including the comment about Instagram posts, might have been condescending. The question is whether the message (she should get a job) is right, or if the delivery made it wrong.\n\nIn AITA threads, the community often looks at intent versus impact. His intent was to be supportive and realistic, but the impact was hurtful. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but the way he communicated it is where the issue lies. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong overall. \n\nConsidering that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his concerns are valid, but some might argue A if the way he communicated is seen as too harsh. But in AITA contexts, the main question is about being in the wrong, not just the tone. Since he's advocating for financial responsibility, which is a good point, the answer is likely B. However, the comment about her Instagram and her body could be seen as disrespectful, which might tip it to A. \n\nBut the core issue is the financial expectation. He's not wrong to want her to contribute fairly. The harsh words are a problem, but does that make him in the wrong? The community might see it as a communication issue rather than being in the wrong. So B.\n"
