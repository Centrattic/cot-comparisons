She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The post is about the author telling their girlfriend she needs to get a job and be productive instead of relying on her family's allowance and Instagram. The girlfriend is graduating with a master's but hasn't worked before. The author is concerned about financial stability if they move in together, as her current plan relies on allowance and affiliate marketing, which he doubts. He called her out for not being in the real world and mentioned her relying on friends with wealthy backgrounds. The girlfriend was upset and felt judged.\n\nSo, first, I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. The author's concerns about financial responsibility and future stability are valid. It's common for people in relationships to discuss financial expectations, especially when moving in together. The author's critique of her not having a job is about practicality\u2014ensuring she can support herself. However, the way he communicated this might have come off as harsh. Phrases like \"you need to get a job and go into the real world like an adult\" and \"you're a bum\" could be seen as condescending, even if his intentions were good.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being realistic. He's pointing out the financial impracticality of relying on allowance and uncertain income from Instagram. The girlfriend might not have considered the real-world costs and the risk of instability. The author's concern about her expecting him to cover expenses is also valid if they plan to split costs equally. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key point is the approach and tone. Even if his concerns are valid, the way he expressed them might have been dismissive or disrespectful. Calling her a \"bum\" and implying her friends are not in the real world could be hurtful. Relationships require communication that is both honest and kind. The author could have approached the discussion more compassionately, perhaps suggesting alternatives or supporting her in finding a job rather than criticizing her current situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction also shows that the communication hurt her feelings, leading her to feel judged. While the author's concerns are practical, the execution might have been lacking in empathy. Therefore, while the author isn't entirely wrong in his concerns, the way he handled the conversation might make him at least partially responsible for the conflict. However, the core issue is whether he's \"in the wrong,\" which could be a yes or no. If the question is about whether his actions were wrong, the harshness and judgmental tone might make the answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong). Alternatively, if the focus is on the validity of his concerns, the answer might be B (No). But since the AITA framework often considers both intent and impact, the way he communicated his concerns could be seen as the problem, making him at fault. So, the answer might be A.\n"
