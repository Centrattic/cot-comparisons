She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the guy suggesting his girlfriend should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and using Instagram for income. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's, has no work experience, and expects to move in with him. She plans to use her parents' money and Instagram affiliate marketing, which he thinks isn't reliable. He's pushing her to get a job, which he sees as responsible, but she's taken offense.\n\nHe's concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to be independent, which is a valid point. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. Telling someone they're \"just living off their parents\" and implying they're not a \"real adult\" can come off as condescending. Also, commenting on her Instagram content by saying it's about \"pics of her ass and tits\" is definitely disrespectful, even if he felt it wasn't a viable income source. That's personal and could have been phrased better.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She feels judged and like a \"bum,\" which makes sense given the criticism. The guy's tone and specific comments might have crossed a line, even if his intentions were good. Being honest about financial concerns is important, but the delivery matters in a relationship. He could have expressed his worries without attacking her lifestyle or appearance.\n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to be realistic about their future together. Financial stability is crucial when moving in together, so his concerns are valid. However, the balance between being honest and being supportive is key. Maybe he could have suggested alternatives, like part-time work while building her Instagram, or helping her explore other income streams without belittling her current approach.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people do have different views on financial independence. Some might agree with him that she should work, others might see her plan as feasible. But the way he criticized her and her friends' lifestyles could have been more empathetic. The term \"real world\" might imply that her way isn't legitimate, which isn't helpful for a partner.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the man has valid financial concerns and the right to expect his partner to contribute, but his approach was disrespectful and potentially hurtful. The answer hinges on whether his intentions were right but his method wrong. Since he's not in the wrong for caring about financial responsibility but is in the wrong for how he communicated it, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because the way he handled it could have been more considerate. However, some might argue that he's not in the wrong because he's being honest about the practicalities. But given the harshness of his comments, especially the Instagram remark, the answer is likely A.\n"
