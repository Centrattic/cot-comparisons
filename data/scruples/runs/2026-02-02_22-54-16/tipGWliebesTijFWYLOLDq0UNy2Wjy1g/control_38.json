She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 22-year-old guy, who is in a relationship with a 23-year-old woman who's about to finish her master's degree. She's never had a job, gets an allowance from her well-off parents, and wants to move in with him, paying half the rent using her allowance and plans to make money via Instagram affiliate marketing.\n\nThe author is concerned she's not being responsible, suggesting she should get a job instead of relying on her parents and social media for income. He argues she needs to enter the real world and not depend on her allowance. She got upset, feeling he called her a \"bum\" and was harsh.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. First, financial independence is a common topic in relationships. The author's concern is valid because relying on parents and social media might not be sustainable. However, the way he expressed his concerns might have been harsh. He criticized her lifestyle and choices, which could have been hurtful. \n\nBut is he wrong for wanting her to be financially responsible? It's reasonable to expect a partner to have a stable income when moving in together. The issue might be how he delivered his message rather than the message itself. He might not be in the wrong for wanting her to be responsible, but maybe the approach was too confrontational. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. \n\nIf the criticism was constructive and based on real concerns, maybe not. But if he came off as condescending or dismissive, that's where the problem lies. The key points are his tone and the validity of his concerns. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are about financial responsibility, but the method might be an issue. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, if his approach was too harsh, he might be partly at fault. But the community often sides with practicality in such cases. So, maybe B.\n"
