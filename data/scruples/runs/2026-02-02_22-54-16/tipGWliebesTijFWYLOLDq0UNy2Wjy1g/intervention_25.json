She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a man in a relationship, is concerned that his girlfriend isn't planning to work and instead relies on her parents' allowance and wants to monetize her Instagram. He's pushing her to get a job, while she's upset and feels judged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is about to get her master's degree but hasn't worked before. Her family is wealthy, giving her a $1k monthly allowance. She plans to move in with the author, paying half the rent using her allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. The author is against this, arguing she should work a real job, save money, and not rely on her family. He's worried she'll struggle financially and expects him to cover the costs, even though he's earning $70k annually.\n\nNow, the author's intentions might be to be responsible and set realistic expectations for their future together. He's concerned about financial stability and wants her to be independent. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels hurt and judged. She might feel that the author is being dismissive of her plans to monetize Instagram and is being critical of her choice to rely on her family's support.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's approach was respectful and constructive. He did express his concerns directly, pointing out potential financial issues and the importance of working. However, he also made a comment about her Instagram content, which could be seen as disrespectful. Using her body image in a negative way might have hurt her feelings, even if his intention was to highlight the impracticality of her plan. His friends' situation is also mentioned, which might imply judgment on her social circle.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend hasn't had a job, so transitioning to working might be a big step. The author's push for her to get a job is practical, but the way he communicated it might have been harsh. He didn't offer support or alternatives, just criticism. This could have made her feel attacked rather than encouraged.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author's main points are valid in terms of financial planning and responsibility. However, the manner in which he delivered his message, especially the comment about her Instagram content, was probably unkind and contributed to her feeling upset. Relationships require communication that's both honest and respectful. While the author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting her to be responsible, the way he approached the conversation might have been too harsh, leading to unnecessary hurt.\n\nSo, the answer might be a balance. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing his concerns about financial responsibility, but the delivery and some of his comments could be seen as disrespectful. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. Since the core issue is about financial planning and the author's intentions are to protect their future, but the method was poor, it's a bit of both. But in AITA terms, sometimes the answer hinges on the approach. If the message was delivered in a way that was hurtful, even if the content was valid, the person might still be in the wrong for the manner. But maybe not. It's tricky. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his main point is reasonable, but some of his comments were poor. However, in AITA contexts, sometimes the answer is more about whether the actions were morally wrong regardless of the intent. Since he was being honest and had valid concerns, even if the delivery was harsh, he might not be in the wrong. But the fact that he made a derogatory comment about her Instagram content could tip it towards him being in the wrong. So maybe A. Hmm. It's a tough call. I'll go with B because the main issue is about financial responsibility and he's trying to be honest, but the comment about her body was unkind. But in AITA, sometimes the answer is B because the person is not wrong for wanting their partner to be responsible. The final answer is B.\n"
