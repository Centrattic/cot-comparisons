She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 22-year-old male, and his girlfriend, a 23-year-old female who's about to finish her master's degree but has never had a job. She's supported financially by her well-off parents, and now she wants to move in with him. The author is concerned about her financial responsibility and suggests she gets a job instead of relying on her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. She's upset because he called her out on this, and now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is advising his GF to take responsibility for her finances. He's planning to have her pay half the rent, which is reasonable. He's concerned that her income from parents and her current plans (Instagram) might not be sufficient, leading to financial strain. He's trying to prepare her for reality, emphasizing the importance of working and saving. However, his tone and choice of words might have been harsh. He mentions she's living off her parents and friends who don't work, and he's critical of her using Instagram for affiliate marketing, even making a comment about her posts. \n\nThe GF is hurt and feels judged. The author acknowledges that her friends are in similar situations, so maybe she's not used to such direct feedback. The question is whether the author was wrong to express his concerns, even if the way he did it was blunt or insensitive.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's common for people to be in the right if they're advocating for their own boundaries or financial responsibilities. The author isn't directly causing harm but is pointing out potential issues. However, the way he communicated it might have been unkind, especially the comment about her Instagram posts. That part could be seen as disrespectful, contributing to her feeling hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intentions seem valid. He's trying to ensure both of them can manage financially and avoid future problems. The core issue is his approach. While he's not wrong about the financial practicality, the delivery might have been the problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting her to be responsible, but his method of communication could have been improved. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on the content of his message rather than the delivery. Since his main point is about financial responsibility, which is a valid concern, but the way he phrased it was harsh, the answer is a bit tricky. But in AITA terms, people are often not considered in the wrong if their intentions are to set boundaries or address practical issues, even if the delivery was rough. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
