She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the man, 22, and his girlfriend, 23, who's about to get a master's degree but has never worked a job. She plans to move in with him and rely on her parents' allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. He's pushing her to get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The man is concerned about financial responsibility. He wants her to be independent and not rely on her parents or unrealistic income streams like Instagram. He's worried about their future together if she doesn't have a stable income. His arguments about saving money, avoiding financial strain, and preparing for real-world responsibilities seem valid. He's also being upfront about his expectations, which is important in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the man is being dismissive of her plans and not supportive. She's transitioning from academia to the workforce, which can be daunting. His comment about her \"posting pics of her ass and tits\" could be seen as disrespectful or undermining her potential. Even if his intention was to be honest, the way he phrased it might have come across as harsh or derogatory. Also, he's making assumptions about her financial capabilities without fully considering her perspective or the viability of her Instagram strategy.\n\nFinancial planning in a relationship is crucial. The man is right to want her to contribute fairly and not depend on him. However, his approach might have been too confrontational. Instead of calling her a \"bum\" or criticizing her appearance, he could have discussed realistic expectations and supported her in finding a job or exploring other income sources. Communication is key here. If he's concerned about her financial future, he should collaborate with her to find solutions rather than making unilateral decisions about her capabilities.\n\nAnother angle is the cultural and social context. Her family's financial support might influence her view of work and independence. The man's friends and environment, where people work for a living, could create a disconnect. It's possible that she's been sheltered and needs guidance, but his method of confronting her might have been too harsh, leading to the emotional reaction.\n\nIn relationships, especially when discussing finances and life choices, empathy and support are important. While the man has valid concerns, the way he expressed them might have been hurtful. He should have been more encouraging, perhaps suggesting job opportunities or helping her understand the financial realities without belittling her aspirations.\n\nSo, considering all this, the man isn't entirely wrong in wanting her to be financially responsible, but his approach and choice of words were inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the manner in which he communicated his concerns, even if his intentions were good.\n"
