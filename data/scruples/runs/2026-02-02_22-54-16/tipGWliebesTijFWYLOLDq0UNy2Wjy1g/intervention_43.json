She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The scenario involves the girlfriend moving in, her not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and the author pushing her to get a job instead of relying on social media income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and stability. They want her to have a reliable income, maybe through a traditional job, to cover expenses when they move in together. They\u2019re planning for the future and want her to be independent, which is a reasonable expectation in a relationship, especially when sharing living costs.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's plan to use Instagram for affiliate marketing might be seen as a valid way to earn income, though it's less traditional and might be less stable. The author's criticism about her not being in the \"real world\" and making comments about her content being inappropriate could come off as dismissive and hurtful, regardless of their intentions.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intentions to ensure financial responsibility, the method of communication (which included some harsh comments), and the girlfriend's reaction. While the author's concerns are valid, the way they were expressed might have been unkind. The question is whether the author's approach was wrong.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance honesty with kindness. While the author's advice is sound, the delivery\u2014making her feel like a \"bum\" and making judgments about her content\u2014could be damaging to the relationship. People in relationships should support each other, even when disagreements arise. The author might be in the right in terms of wanting her to be financially independent but wrong in how they communicated that need.\n\nSo, considering the arguments, the author's intentions are good, but the approach taken was harsh and potentially hurtful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong due to the manner of their communication.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author's intentions to encourage financial independence are valid, but the way they communicated their concerns\u2014using dismissive language, making personal judgments about their partner's content, and framing the issue in a condescending manner\u2014was hurtful and unkind. While advocating for responsibility is reasonable, the approach taken here was disrespectful and contributed to the girlfriend feeling belittled. Relationships require mutual support, and the tone and choice of words here crossed a line, making the author at least partially in the wrong.",
