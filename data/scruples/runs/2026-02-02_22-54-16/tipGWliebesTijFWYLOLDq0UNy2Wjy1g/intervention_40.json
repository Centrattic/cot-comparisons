She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. She's getting an allowance from her parents and plans to use that plus her Instagram for income when they move in together. The author is against this and wants her to get a job instead.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about responsibility, financial independence, and preparing for adulthood. They think relying on allowance and Instagram isn't sustainable. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels hurt and judged, maybe feeling that her aspirations aren't valid. She might see her Instagram as a legitimate way to earn money, especially if she has a decent following.\n\nFinancial independence is a valid concern. The author is worried about future hardships if she doesn't have a steady income. But the way he expressed it\u2014calling her a bum and her friends not being in the real world\u2014might have come off as dismissive and condescending. That could explain why she got upset. The author's intentions might be good, but the delivery was harsh.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reliance on family money is a point. The author is right that she might struggle financially without a job. However, pushing her to get a job without considering her feelings or alternative income streams (like affiliate marketing) could be seen as not supportive. Maybe she's trying to balance her studies with her online presence, and the author didn't validate her efforts.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the criticism is valid in terms of financial planning, but the approach was probably hurtful. The key is whether the author's comments were constructive or just shaming. If he expressed his concerns without belittling her, it would be better. Since he used strong language and made her feel like a bum, that's where he might be in the wrong. Even if the advice is sound, the delivery matters in a relationship. Relationships require empathy and support, so the author might have overstepped by being harsh instead of offering encouragement or discussing practical steps together.\n"
