She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 22-year-old man, and his girlfriend, a 23-year-old woman who's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. Her family is wealthy and gives her a $1k+ monthly allowance. She wants to move in with him, paying half the rent, using her allowance and expanding her Instagram for affiliate marketing. The author pushed her to get a job instead of relying on her parents and social media, which led to an argument where she felt insulted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about financial responsibility. He's making $70k this year and wants her to be independent, not rely on her parents or unrealistic income from social media. His reasoning is that her current plan leaves her with little after bills, and he's not willing to support her financially. That makes sense from a financial planning standpoint. He's trying to set realistic expectations for their future together.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a master's degree and hasn't worked, supported by her family. She's transitioning into the workforce, which can be challenging. The author's approach might come off as harsh or dismissive. He criticized her Instagram income as being based on \"pics of her ass and tits,\" which could be seen as belittling her efforts. Even if his intentions are good, the way he delivered the message might have been hurtful. She felt called a \"bum,\" which is a personal attack rather than a constructive conversation.\n\nFinancial independence is important, but how it's communicated matters. The author is right to encourage her to get a job for financial stability, but his tone and the specific comment about her content could be offensive. He didn't consider her feelings or the effort she's putting into her Instagram. Maybe he should have been supportive but also set boundaries. The key here is whether his approach was constructive or just critical. Since the question is about being in the wrong, it's not just about the content of his message but also the manner in which it was delivered.\n\nIn relationships, especially when discussing finances, communication is key. The author's intentions might be valid, but the execution could have been better. He might not be in the wrong for wanting her to be responsible, but his method of expressing it might be. However, it's also important to note that he's being realistic about their financial future, which is a legitimate concern. The line between being supportive and being critical is thin here. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author's main issue is the way he communicated his concerns rather than the concerns themselves. He's not entirely wrong for wanting her to be responsible, but his approach could have been more considerate. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because his delivery was harsh and potentially disrespectful, even if his concerns are valid.\n"
