She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to finish her master's, hasn't had a job before, gets an allowance from her parents, and wants to move in with the author. She plans to use her Instagram for affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. The author is pushing her to get a job, and their conversation led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to be independent. He's on track to make $70k, but he doesn't want to support her financially. He's trying to set realistic expectations about bills and rent. His main argument is that relying on parents and social media income isn't stable, and she needs real employment.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a master's degree but hasn't worked. She's using her parents' allowance and social media for income. She might feel that her plans are valid, especially if she has a large following. The author's comments about her content being \"pics of her ass and tits\" might come off as dismissive or condescending, which could hurt her feelings. The way he framed his message as making her feel like a \"bum\" is a point against him.\n\nFinancial independence is a valid concern, but the approach matters. The author's tone and specific comments about her content might have been harsh. Telling someone they're not productive could be seen as judgmental, especially in a relationship. Also, suggesting that her friends are not in the real world might not be helpful and could be perceived as blaming others. The key here is whether the criticism was constructive or just hurtful.\n\nThe author's intention is understandable\u2014he wants her to be responsible and self-sufficient. However, how he communicated that might be the issue. The term \"productivity\" can be subjective. If the author had discussed their financial plans together, offering support rather than criticism, that might have been better. The fact that she got upset and felt insulted suggests that his approach wasn't the best, even if his concerns are valid.\n\nIn relationships, especially when discussing finances and future plans, communication style is crucial. The author's comments about her content and friends might have been more about personal attacks rather than addressing the financial issues. So while he's right in wanting her to have a job, the way he delivered it could be seen as the author being in the wrong for not being supportive and for hurting her feelings.\n"
