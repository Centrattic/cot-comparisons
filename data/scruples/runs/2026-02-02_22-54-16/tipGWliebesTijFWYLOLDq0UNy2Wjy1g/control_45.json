She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the guy telling his girlfriend she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy, 22, is concerned about their future living arrangement. He wants her to be financially responsible, which makes sense. She's 23, has a master's degree but no work experience, and relies on her family's money. He's worried she's not realistic about her financial plans, thinking she can make money through Instagram (which he doubts) instead of getting a job.\n\nOn the other hand, she got upset and felt belittled. He criticized her lifestyle and friends, implying she's not taking her responsibilities seriously. He called her a \"bum\" and mentioned her body in a derogatory way when talking about her Instagram content. That might be where the issue is. Even if he's right about the financial planning, the way he communicated it was harsh and disrespectful.\n\nHe's also suggesting that her friends are not in the real world, which could be judgmental. Maybe he's overstepping by making assumptions about her life choices. While it's valid to discuss financial responsibilities in a relationship, how he approached it might have been condescending and hurtful.\n\nThe key points are: Is it wrong to encourage someone to be financially independent in a relationship? Probably not wrong in intent. But the method of communication matters. Insulting her, criticizing her body, and belittling her friends might cross the line. So, the answer would depend on whether the intent was constructive criticism or if the delivery was unnecessarily harsh. Since he used derogatory terms and made her feel like a bum, he might be in the wrong.\n"
