She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society when she's planning to move in with him. She's graduating with a master's but has never had a job. She's relying on her family's allowance and wants to use Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned about financial responsibility. He's willing to have her cover half the rent, but she's relying on her parents' money and affiliate marketing. He's pushing her to get a job. Is that being inconsiderate or is it reasonable?\n\nHe points out the practical issue: with her current plan, she might struggle financially after rent and bills. He's not okay with covering the expenses himself, even though he's earning 70k. He's trying to set boundaries, which is important. However, the way he communicates this might come off as harsh. He mentions her income sources in a dismissive way, calling her friends a bad influence, which could hurt her feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend reacts emotionally, feeling belittled. The author's intention is to promote responsibility, but his approach might lack empathy. Is it fair to criticize her for not having a job when she's in school, especially since her family supports her financially? Maybe she's in a different life situation. But moving in together implies shared financial responsibility, so he's right to address it.\n\nHowever, the way he frames it as her being a \"bum\" or making money from \"pics of her ass and tits\" is disrespectful. That part is definitely inconsiderate. He's not wrong to want her to be financially independent, but the tone and choice of words might cross a line. So, the answer is a balance between his valid concerns and his approach. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the author's intentions are reasonable, but the execution could be better. However, in AITA scenarios, people often look at both sides. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and maybe that's the case because he's advocating for practicality, but the way he did it is questionable. But given the options A or B, I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his concerns are valid and he's setting boundaries, even if the delivery was harsh.\n"
