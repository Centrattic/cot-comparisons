She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and the author pushing her to get a job instead of just relying on social media for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is concerned about their financial future together. He's making 70k this year and wants her to contribute equally to rent and bills. She's about to graduate with a master's but hasn't worked a job yet. Her plan is to use her Instagram (with 8k followers) for affiliate marketing. The author is skeptical about her ability to make enough and thinks she should get a regular job instead. She took offense, feeling judged and called a \"bum,\" and the author's tone seems harsh.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, how we communicate our concerns matters. The author's intention might be valid\u2014financial stability is important. But the way he expressed it might have been hurtful. Using phrases like \"move into reality\" and making comments about her content could be seen as condescending. Even if his advice is reasonable, the manner in which he delivered it might have been disrespectful, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's situation isn't that far-fetched. Starting a side hustle through social media isn't unheard of, and she's trying to leverage her existing platform. The author dismissing her plan as just posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" seems judgmental and might not account for the effort or strategy involved in affiliate marketing. It's possible that she has a legitimate business plan, but the author didn't consider that angle.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns. Financial responsibility in a relationship is crucial. If they're moving in together, splitting expenses fairly is essential. The author is right to want her to be self-sufficient. However, the approach matters. Insulting her current situation or mocking her method of earning might not be the best way to approach the conversation.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a clue. She felt belittled and called the author names, which suggests that the communication wasn't effective. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and constructive dialogue. Even if the author's intentions are good, the way he communicated might have been harmful.\n\nSo, considering all this, while the author's concerns are reasonable, the way he expressed them could be seen as inconsiderate. He might not be entirely in the wrong for having the conversation, but the approach was problematic. However, the key issue is whether he's in the wrong for the content of the message versus the delivery. If he's advocating for financial responsibility, that's valid, but the tone and specific comments could make him at fault. The answer might depend on the balance between valid concerns and respectful communication.\n"
