She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a guy, is telling his girlfriend, who's about to finish her master's and has never worked, that she needs to get a real job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. The girlfriend gets upset and calls him names.\n\nSo, the author is asking if he's in the wrong (AITA). The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The girlfriend has never had a job, is relying on her parents' money, and plans to use her Instagram for income. The author is concerned about their financial future together, especially since she's moving in and wants to split costs. He's pointing out the reality that her current plan might not be sustainable. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his concerns. Financial responsibility is important, especially in a relationship where you're sharing living expenses. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable, like working full-time immediately, but rather suggesting a stable income source. \n\nOn the other hand, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. He called her out for not working and implied she's not a \"real adult,\" which could come off as dismissive or disrespectful. Also, making comments about her Instagram content (posts he finds inappropriate) could be hurtful and undermine her efforts. \n\nBut the main issue is whether he's wrong for expressing his legitimate concerns. Relationships require mutual support and realistic planning. If he's worried about their financial stability, it's reasonable to discuss it. However, the tone and the specific comments about her content might have been unkind. \n\nThe key here is the balance between honesty and sensitivity. While the author has valid points about financial responsibility, the way he delivered them might have been unkind, leading to her feeling belittled. However, the core message about needing a stable income isn't inherently wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is in the right if they're advocating for practicality, but if the approach was unnecessarily harsh, it could tip the scales. Here, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting her to be financially responsible, but the manner in which he expressed it might be questionable. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong\" in general, not just the delivery, the answer might still be B (not in the wrong) because the underlying concern is valid. But some might argue that his approach was wrong. \n\nI think the main issue is that he's right about the financial planning aspect, but his delivery could have been better. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just the delivery. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his concerns are legitimate, even if the communication could have been improved.\n"
