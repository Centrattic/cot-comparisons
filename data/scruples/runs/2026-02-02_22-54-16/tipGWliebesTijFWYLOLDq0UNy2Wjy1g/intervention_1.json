She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their girlfriend to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 22-year-old guy with a girlfriend who's 23 and about to finish her master's. She hasn't worked before, gets an allowance from her parents, and wants to move in with him, paying half the rent using that allowance and hopes to make money through Instagram. The author is pushing her to get a job, saying she needs to be productive. She got upset, feeling attacked.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to be independent. It's reasonable to want her to have a stable income, especially if they're moving in together. He's pointing out practical issues like struggling with expenses if she relies only on allowance and affiliate marketing. That seems responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the way he approached it might have come off as harsh or dismissive. Calling her a \"bum\" and criticizing her friends and their lifestyles could be hurtful. Using phrases like \"posting pics of her ass and tits\" might be disrespectful and could have made her feel belittled. Even if his intentions were good, the delivery might have been unkind, leading to her feeling upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the message's content or the way he delivered it. The content\u2014encouraging her to get a job\u2014is reasonable. The delivery, however, could be problematic. Yelling at someone or making them feel like a failure might not be the right approach, even if the concern is valid. But in the AITA context, people often judge based on both intent and impact.\n\nConsidering that, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong for expressing his concerns, but the approach could be better. However, in the AITA framework, sometimes the focus is on whether they overstepped, regardless of intent. The fact that he criticized her lifestyle and friends' lifestyles might be seen as judgmental. Also, the comment about her Instagram content being just photos of her body could be seen as disrespectful, even if she does that. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because of the harsh way he communicated his concerns, even if the concerns themselves are valid. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he's being responsible and honest. But given that AITA often considers the emotional impact, maybe the answer is A.\n"
