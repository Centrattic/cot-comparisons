She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 22-year-old guy in a relationship with a 23-year-old girl who's about to finish her master's degree. She hasn't had a job before and gets a $1k+ monthly allowance from her parents, who are both professionals. She wants to move in with him, and she plans to use her parents' allowance and expand her Instagram to make money through affiliate marketing instead of getting a traditional job. The author is against this, telling her she needs to get a job and be an adult, pointing out that relying on her allowance and Instagram might not be enough. He mentions she might struggle financially and that he won't support her if she doesn't contribute. She got upset, feeling he's an asshole for calling her out.\n\nFirst, the author's concern seems valid. He's worried about their financial stability if they move in together. She's not working, relying on family money, and trying to monetize Instagram, which isn't a guaranteed income. He's trying to set realistic expectations. But the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. He criticized her lifestyle, mentioned her body in a derogatory way (\"posting pics of her ass and tits\"), and compared her to her friends who are also not working. That part definitely sounds condescending and hurtful. He's right about the financial planning, but the delivery could have been more supportive.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being responsible by discussing practical matters. Moving in together is a big step, and financial compatibility is important. He's not wrong to want her to have a stable income. However, the way he dismissed her plans for affiliate marketing, especially with a negative comment about her content, might have been unnecessary. It's possible he undermined her efforts and made her feel devalued. Even if his intentions were good, the approach was hurtful.\n\nThe girl's reaction is also understandable. Feeling called a \"bum\" and criticized for her lifestyle, especially when she's coming from a supportive family, could be emotionally wounding. The author might not have considered her feelings while presenting his points. There's a balance between being honest about financial realities and being respectful. He might have crossed the line into being judgmental rather than helpful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to address a real issue, but the method he used wasn't constructive. He should have focused on the financial aspects without belittling her or her content. The fact that he acknowledged her Instagram's current follower count and potential but then mocked the content itself shows a lack of sensitivity. It's possible he's right about the need for a job, but his communication style caused conflict unnecessarily.\n\nSo, considering both sides: he's right about the financial concerns but wrong in how he communicated them. The answer would depend on whether the wrong in communication outweighs the right in the message. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer is probably A (he is in the wrong) because of the hurtful comments and the way he dismissed her efforts, even if his intentions were good.\n"
