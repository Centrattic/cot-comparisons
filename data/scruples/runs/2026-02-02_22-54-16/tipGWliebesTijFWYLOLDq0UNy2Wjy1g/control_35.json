She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who told their girlfriend to become productive is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy is 22, the girl is 23. She's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. Her parents provide her with $1k+ a month allowance. She wants to move in with him, paying half the rent. He's okay with that but when she says she'll use her allowance and expand her Instagram for income, he pushes her to get a job. She gets upset, feeling called out as a \"bum,\" and accuses him of being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. He's concerned about financial stability. Her plan relies on allowance and potentially unreliable income from Instagram. He's suggesting a more stable path with a job. But the way he communicated this might be the issue. He called her out for not working, implying she's not an adult, and made a comment about her content (posts of her body). That last part is probably where he went wrong. Even if his intentions were good, the way he phrased it could be hurtful. She's in a vulnerable position, moving in with him, and his criticism might feel like a betrayal. Also, he's not in a position to judge her choices, especially since he's expecting her to contribute financially. Maybe he should've approached it with more empathy instead of being confrontational. But also, is it reasonable for him to expect her to have a job? If they're living together, splitting costs is fair, so his concern is valid. However, the method of communication and the derogatory remarks about her content are problematic. So, there are elements where he's right (financial responsibility) and elements where he's wrong (the way he expressed it). But the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might hinge on communication style and respect. The comment about her Instagram content being about her body is especially sensitive and could be seen as disrespectful, even if he's making a point about income reliability. So, even though his concerns are understandable, his approach was likely inappropriate. Therefore, answer A (he's in the wrong) might be the right choice here.\n"
