She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her $1k+ a month. She wants to move in with him, paying half the rent and bills using her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. He told her she needs to get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The guy is saying she's not contributing as a \"productive member\" by just relying on her allowance and trying to monetize Instagram. He's worried she won't be able to cover expenses and expects him to support her. She got upset, called him names, and felt judged. \n\nNow, is he wrong for expressing his concerns? Well, he's being honest about financial expectations. It's reasonable to discuss responsibilities before moving in together. But maybe his tone was harsh. He called her a \"bum\" and made comments about her Instagram posts, which might be condescending. He also made assumptions about her ability to earn money through affiliate marketing without evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to set boundaries and ensure financial stability. She's in a privileged position with her parents' support, but maybe she feels that her path (using social media) is valid. The issue could be communication style. He might not realize that his criticism could hurt her, especially if she's transitioning from a sheltered life. \n\nIs it wrong to push her to be responsible? Maybe not. But the way he did it might be the problem. He didn't support her aspirations but dismissed them. So maybe the answer is a mix, but according to the options given, I have to choose A or B. AITA usually considers if the person is in the wrong. The guy's intentions are good (financial responsibility), but his approach might be wrong. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because of the harsh comments and judgment. But I'm a bit conflicted because he's right about financial planning. Hmm.\n"
