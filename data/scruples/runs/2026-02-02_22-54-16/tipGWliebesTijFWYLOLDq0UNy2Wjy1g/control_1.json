She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (a 22-year-old guy) telling his girlfriend (23) that she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's degree and has never worked a job. She plans to move in with him and pay half the rent using her allowance and her Instagram income. The author is concerned that she's not being productive and doesn't understand financial responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's argument is that she should get a job to be a productive member of society, earn real money, and avoid financial struggles. He's worried she expects him to cover expenses if she can't make enough. The girlfriend got upset, feeling insulted and accused of being a bum. The author uses some harsh language, like calling her friends \"bums\" and making a comment about her Instagram posts. \n\nNow, considering the ethical angle here. Is it wrong to encourage someone to be financially responsible? Well, financial responsibility is generally seen as a positive trait. The author is expressing concern about their future living arrangements and financial stability. However, the way he conveyed his message might be an issue. He came across as judgmental and condescending, using phrases like \"move into reality\" and implying she's not an adult yet. Also, the comment about her Instagram posts being about her body could be seen as disrespectful, even if it's true. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important too. She's about to finish her education and is transitioning into a new phase. Her plan to use her Instagram for income might not be as unrealistic as the author thinks, though it's risky. The fact that her parents are providing support might not be the issue; the problem is that the author is critical of her approach without considering her feelings or potential. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, the author's approach might be seen as dismissive of her aspirations and capabilities. Even if his concerns are valid, the way he expressed them could have been hurtful. Healthy communication involves expressing concerns without belittling the other person. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, his concerns about financial responsibility are reasonable. On the other hand, his delivery was harsh, judgmental, and possibly disrespectful. The key here is whether the intent was valid but the method was inappropriate. In AITA scenarios, the tone and respect in the communication often play a big role. The author's comments about her Instagram and friends being out of the real world might have been unnecessary and could have been framed more constructively. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that the author's words deeply hurt her, which is a red flag. Even if he's right about the need for her to get a job, the way he communicated it led to conflict. So, while the underlying issue might be valid, the manner in which it was addressed is where the author could be in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the judgmental tone and disrespectful language used, even if his intentions were to encourage responsibility.\n"
