She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the guy, who's 22, telling his girlfriend, who's 23, that she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. The girl is graduating with a master's degree but has never had a job. The guy is concerned about her financial stability and not wanting to be the one supporting her, while she's upset and feels he's being harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy's intention seems to be about financial responsibility and independence. He's planning for them to live together, and he's realistic about her budget if she gets a job versus relying on her parents and affiliate marketing. He's also concerned that her friends aren't in the real world, so she might not have seen the necessity of working.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might feel that her partner is being dismissive of her efforts to monetize her Instagram and that he's undermining her by making comments about the content (posting pics of her body). She could feel that he's not supporting her dreams or her chosen path. Also, she's coming from a family that provides financial support, so maybe she hasn't had to deal with the pressures of working a traditional job yet.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility versus personal freedom and expectations in a relationship. The guy is pushing for practicality, while the girl might feel her approach is valid. The question is whether his approach is being an asshole.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the person crossed a line. The guy's comments about her content on Instagram might be seen as disrespectful, even if his concerns are valid. The term \"posting pics of her ass and tits\" could be hurtful and judgmental, which might make him the asshole in terms of communication style. However, his main concern about financial responsibility is legitimate.\n\nBut the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. Instead of supporting her in finding a balance between her studies, her Instagram, and a job, he criticized her and her friends. The girl feeling like a \"bum\" is a significant emotional impact. So, while his intentions might be good, the method could be where he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be that he's not entirely in the wrong because he's raising valid financial points, but his delivery was poor. However, in the AITA context, the community often prioritizes how the situation made the other person feel. The girl's emotional reaction suggests that his approach was hurtful, even if his intentions were good. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the disrespectful communication, even if the underlying concerns are valid.\n"
