She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about the author, a 22-year-old guy, telling his 23-year-old girlfriend that she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram for income. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's degree and has never had a job before. The author is against her moving in with him unless she gets a job, arguing that she needs to become a \"productive member of society.\" She got upset and called him names, and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author is concerned about his girlfriend's financial independence and wants her to be responsible. He's okay with her paying half the rent, but she's relying on her parents' money and an uncertain income from Instagram. He's suggesting she get a job to secure her income, which is reasonable for someone moving in together. However, the way he communicated this might have been harsh. He criticized her lifestyle and friends, calling her a \"bum\" and implying she's not living in reality. He also made a comment about her using her body on Instagram, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a right to choose her career path, even if it's unconventional. However, financial responsibility is important, especially if they're planning to live together. The author is trying to set boundaries for their future together, which is understandable. But the way he expressed his concerns might have been insensitive. The key issue here is whether the author's intentions were valid but his methods were wrong, or if his criticism is justified.\n\nLooking at common AITA scenarios, people are often in the right if they're setting boundaries about their own living situations and advocating for financial responsibility. However, the tone and delivery can affect the outcome. Insulting someone's choices, even if they're questionable, can make the person criticizing seem in the wrong. The author called her a \"bum,\" criticized her friends, and made a derogatory comment about her Instagram content, which crossed a line into personal attacks rather than constructive discussion.\n\nSo, while the author has valid concerns about financial stability, the way he communicated them was disrespectful and harmful. Therefore, he's more likely in the wrong for the way he expressed his concerns rather than the concerns themselves. The answer would be A, meaning he is in the wrong.\n"
