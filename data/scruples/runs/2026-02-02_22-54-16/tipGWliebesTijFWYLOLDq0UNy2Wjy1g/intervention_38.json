She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, a 22-year-old guy, who is telling his girlfriend, who's 23, that she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram affiliate marketing. The girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's degree but has never had a job. The author is concerned about her financial independence and their shared living situation where she expects to cover half the rent with her allowance and Instagram money. The girlfriend got upset, feeling called out as a \"bum.\"\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He's trying to be realistic about financial responsibilities. He's planning their future and thinks she needs to contribute equally, which is reasonable. He's concerned about her financial stability if she relies on an unreliable income source like Instagram affiliate marketing. His comments about her needing a real job and his criticism of her friends' lifestyles might have been harsh, but his intentions are about responsibility and mutual support.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: She's about to graduate with a master's, which implies she's been in education, maybe in a field that requires further study (like a terminal degree). Her family's financial support is enabling her to focus on her education. She's transitioning into a new phase, and her plan, though perhaps unrealistic, is her attempt to become self-sufficient. The author's direct approach might have come off as dismissive or disrespectful, making her feel attacked. She might feel that her efforts (even if not fully formed) are being belittled, and his suggestion that she's a \"bum\" could be demoralizing.\n\nThe key points to consider are: 1) The author's right to express concerns about financial responsibility vs. the girlfriend's right to her chosen path. 2) The tone and delivery of the message. 3) The girlfriend's current situation and how she's handling the transition from education to the workforce.\n\nThe author is correct in pointing out the financial realities of their shared living situation. It's reasonable to expect that she contributes fairly, especially if they are moving in together. However, the way he communicated his concerns\u2014calling her a \"bum,\" criticizing her friends, and being dismissive of her Instagram plan\u2014might have been hurtful and could have been said more sensitively. The girlfriend's feelings are valid; being told she's not contributing as an adult can be hurtful, especially if she's already under pressure to transition.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the main question is whether the actions were reasonable given the context. The author's intentions are good, but the manner in which he delivered his message could be seen as harsh. The girlfriend's reaction is also understandable given the criticism. So, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong, the way he handled the conversation might have contributed to the conflict. However, the core issue of financial responsibility is valid. The answer might depend on whether the criticism was justified in terms of content vs. delivery.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often considers both the intent and the impact. If the author's comments were meant to be constructive but came across as harsh, he might not be the asshole, but he could have handled it better. The girlfriend's feelings are important, but so is the need for financial stability. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for discussion on how to approach such a sensitive topic.\n"
