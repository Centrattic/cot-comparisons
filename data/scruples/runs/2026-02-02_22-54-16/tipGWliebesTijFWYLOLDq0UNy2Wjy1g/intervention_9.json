She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The girlfriend is graduating with a master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k+ allowance. She wants to move in, pay half the rent, and use her Instagram for affiliate marketing. The author thinks she should get a job instead. She got upset and called him names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concern is valid because financial independence is important, especially in a shared living situation. They're worried about her relying on family money and possibly expecting him to cover expenses. It's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute fairly. But the way he communicated it might have come off as harsh. He called her a \"bum\" and mocked her content, which could be hurtful. Respectful communication is key in relationships. Even if the message is correct, the delivery matters.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: she's transitioning into the workforce after graduate school. Maybe she's exploring different ways to monetize her skills, like affiliate marketing. Relying on family support isn't unusual, especially if they're financially stable. The author's dismissiveness of her plans might not account for her confidence or the potential of her online endeavors. Also, his tone and choice of words seem to undermine her efforts, which could explain her emotional reaction.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The core issue is the approach. While his intention is to encourage responsibility, the method could be seen as condescending. He might not be in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but the way he did it could be problematic. The answer hinges on whether the rightness of his advice overrides the hurtful manner. Some might say he's not in the wrong because he's advocating for financial responsibility, but others might say he's in the wrong for the way he delivered it. However, in AITA contexts, the community often focuses on both the action and the intent. If the advice is well-meaning but delivered poorly, it's a grey area. But given that he's pushing for her independence in a shared financial arrangement, maybe he's not in the wrong. The key is whether the criticism is justified. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's a better angle. Alternatively, maybe A because the way he spoke to her was disrespectful. Hmm.\n"
