She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who made the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a guy, and his girlfriend, who is about to finish her master's but has never had a job. Her family is wealthy, and she gets a $1k+ allowance. She wants to move in with him, pay half the rent, but plans to use her parents' money and expand her Instagram for income. He's pushing her to get a job instead, which upsets her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and wants his partner to be independent. She's relying on her family's money and a potentially unreliable income source (Instagram affiliate marketing). He's worried about their financial stability once they live together and that she might expect him to cover costs if she doesn't make enough. \n\nHe's being honest about his concerns, which is reasonable. However, the way he expressed it might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum\" and made a demeaning comment about her Instagram content. That's probably where the conflict arises. Even if his intentions are good, the tone and specific remarks could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, he's taking her financial future seriously. It's important for both partners to be financially responsible, especially when moving in together. His concern that she might not save money and could rely on him is valid. But the way he communicated his concerns might have been too confrontational or dismissive of her plans.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the focus is on the content of his message rather than the delivery, he's not wrong to want her to be independent. However, his choice of words and the harshness of his criticism could be seen as insensitive. The AITA format often looks at both intent and impact. While his intent was to encourage responsibility, the impact was hurtful. So there's a balance here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for being unsupportive or harsh, even if their points are valid. The girlfriend's response indicates she felt belittled. The author's comment about her using \"pics of her ass and tits\" is particularly problematic, even if it's a truth. It's a disrespectful way to address her chosen method of making money. \n\nSo, while the core concern is valid, the manner in which he conveyed it makes him at least partially responsible for the conflict. The answer might hinge on whether the wrong is in the message's content or delivery. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering the hurtful language used, the answer could be A. But if the focus is on the financial advice being reasonable, then B. However, given the tone and specific remarks, it's more likely A. But I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
