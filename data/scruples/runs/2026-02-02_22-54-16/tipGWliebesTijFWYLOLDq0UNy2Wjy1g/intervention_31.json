She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society, given that she's about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. She's getting an allowance from her parents and wants to move in with the author, paying half the rent using her allowance and plans to make money through Instagram affiliate marketing. The author is against this, thinking she should get a job instead, and the girlfriend got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about responsibility and wanting their partner to be financially independent. They're concerned about her relying on family money and not facing the realities of working. The girlfriend feels criticized and judged, leading her to feel like a \"bum.\" \n\nThe key points here are about communication, expectations in a relationship, and financial responsibility. The author's intentions might be rooted in wanting to build a stable future together, but the way they expressed their concerns might have come off as harsh or dismissive. Saying things like \"she needs to get a job and move into the real world like an adult\" and making a comment about her using her body on Instagram could be seen as condescending or not supportive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns. Relying on family money indefinitely isn't sustainable, and expecting a partner to cover costs while not contributing financially could lead to long-term issues. But how the author communicated these concerns matters. Instead of being confrontational, they might have approached it with more empathy and understanding. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the message was delivered in a way that hurt her feelings, making her feel attacked.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's background: her family is well-off, and she's used to being supported. Transitioning to independence can be challenging, and the author's criticism might not account for her personal growth journey. The author might not have considered alternative paths, like her using her Instagram for affiliate marketing, which could be a valid income source, though maybe not enough alone. However, dismissing her efforts as just posting certain content without support could undermine her potential.\n\nIn relationships, communication style is crucial. Even if the message is about financial responsibility, the delivery affects how it's received. The author might have been right to bring up the topic but not in the way they did. They might not be in the wrong for having these concerns but could be in the wrong for how they expressed them. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether their actions were justified.\n\nSome people might argue that the author is right to encourage responsibility, while others might say they should have approached the conversation more sensitively. The term \"AITA\" usually focuses on the moral rightness of the action. Here, the author's intentions are good, but the method was flawed. So, the answer could be a bit of both. But since the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide which side is stronger. The key is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since they expressed their concerns in a way that hurt the girlfriend and didn't consider her feelings, maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong. However, the core issue of wanting the girlfriend to be responsible isn't wrong. But the way it was handled is problematic. In many cases, \"AITA\" forums often consider both intent and action. If the action was hurtful, even with good intentions, the person might be considered in the wrong. So, the answer might be A. But I'm a bit conflicted because the author's concerns are valid. However, the way they were presented led to a negative outcome. So leaning towards A, but some might say B. Hmm.\n"
