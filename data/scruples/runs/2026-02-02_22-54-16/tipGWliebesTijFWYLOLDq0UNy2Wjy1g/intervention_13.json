She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for urging his girlfriend to get a job and be more productive. The situation is that his girlfriend is about to finish her master's, has never had a job, and relies on her parents' allowance. She wants to move in with him, paying half the rent with her allowance and her plan to monetize Instagram. The author is concerned she's being unrealistic and that she might not be able to afford things beyond rent and bills, leading to financial strain. He expressed these concerns, which made her upset, feeling judged and called an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author is trying to be responsible, pointing out practical financial realities. His girlfriend is coming from a supportive family, which is a valid starting point for her. However, the author is concerned about their future together if she doesn't have a stable income. His main points are about financial sustainability and not relying on her parents or his income.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her goals (like affiliate marketing) are valid, even if they're not traditional jobs. She might also feel that the author is being dismissive of her aspirations and undermining her by making comments about her social media content. The way he communicated his concerns could have been harsh, especially the comment about her posting pictures. Even if his intentions were good, the delivery might have come across as condescending or disrespectful.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to express his concerns but did so in a way that was hurtful. Financial discussions in relationships can be sensitive, and how they're approached matters. The author's advice is reasonable from a financial standpoint, but the manner in which he delivered it, including the sarcastic remarks about her Instagram content, likely caused unnecessary hurt. \n\nSo, while the author's concerns are valid and his intention to be responsible is commendable, his approach may have been inappropriate. The question is whether the content of his message (the advice) is right or if the way he communicated it (the tone and specific comments) is what's problematic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" for wanting to be financially responsible, but his method of communication could be seen as lacking empathy. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for the content of his message. If the issue is the advice itself, then he's not in the wrong. If the issue is the delivery, then maybe he's not in the wrong either, but perhaps he could have handled it better. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong for the content of his message (telling her to get a job), the answer would be B (No). However, if the question is about the manner, maybe it's a different answer. But the user's question is about the content, not the delivery. The user also thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B.\n"
