She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and planning to move in with him while using her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. She's getting $1k+ from her parents, which seems substantial. The author is concerned about her financial responsibility and independence. He suggests she get a job instead of relying on her parents and doing affiliate marketing through Instagram. \n\nThe author's argument is about financial responsibility and moving towards independence. He's concerned about their future living together and the sustainability of her income. On the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because he criticized her approach, possibly feeling he's being harsh without considering her plans or background. \n\nI should think about whether the author's actions are justified. He's trying to be responsible, but maybe his approach was too harsh. He criticized her Instagram method and called her friends' lifestyles into question, which might have come across as judgmental. \n\nFinancial independence is a valid concern in a relationship, especially when moving in together. However, how he communicated this might be the issue. He didn't support her in finding a job but instead criticized her current path. Also, making comments about her content (posts of her body) could be seen as disrespectful, even if he disagrees with her methods.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being realistic about financial planning. If she only has a few hundred dollars left after expenses, that's not sustainable. Encouraging her to work is reasonable, but the tone and methods of communication matter. \n\nSo, the key points are: Is it wrong to encourage financial responsibility? No. But the way he expressed it\u2014calling her a \"bum,\" making comments about her content, and dismissing her plans without support\u2014could be the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because of the manner in which he conveyed his concerns, not the content of his message itself.\n"
