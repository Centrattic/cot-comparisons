She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram. He's M22, she's F23, about to get a master's. She's never had a job, lives with her wealthy parents, gets $1k+ a month. They're moving in together, he wants her to pay half the rent, but she plans to use her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. He's against this, says she should get a job, maybe minimum wage, to be more financially stable. He's worried she'll run out of money and expect him to cover expenses. He also made some comments about her using Instagram for certain content, which she found hurtful. She got upset, called him names.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The author is concerned about their financial future and wants her to be independent. He's right to consider practical matters, especially if they're moving in together. However, the way he communicated this might be a problem. He called her a \"bum\" and referred to her Instagram content in a derogatory way, which could be hurtful and disrespectful. Even if his intentions are valid, the tone and choice of words matter in relationships. She might feel criticized for her lifestyle, especially if she's transitioning from a supportive family environment to independence. While his concerns are valid, the approach could be seen as dismissive of her efforts and aspirations. So, it's a balance between being realistic and being supportive. He might not be in the wrong in terms of the message, but the delivery could be problematic.\n"
