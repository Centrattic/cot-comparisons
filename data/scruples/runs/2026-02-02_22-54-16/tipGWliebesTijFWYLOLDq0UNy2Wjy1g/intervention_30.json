She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is graduating with a master's, has never worked a job, gets a $1k+ allowance from her parents, and wants to move in with the author. The author is okay with her paying half the rent but is concerned that she relies on her parents and an Instagram affiliate marketing plan that he doubts. He told her she needs a real job and expressed concerns about her financial independence.\n\nFirst, the author's intention seems to be about financial responsibility and wanting the relationship to be fair. He's worried she won't be able to cover expenses and might end up dependent on him. But how he communicated this is important. He came across as judgmental, questioning her ability to make money through Instagram and even making a comment about her posting pictures of her body. That's probably where the issue lies. \n\nEven if his concerns are valid, the way he presented them could have been more supportive. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or an \"asshole\" might not be the best approach. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable\u2014feeling attacked can make people defensive. The author might not be wrong in wanting her to be financially independent, but the delivery and the personal comments (especially about her Instagram content) could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the author is making assumptions about her financial plan without discussing it in depth. Maybe she has a viable strategy for affiliate marketing, even if he doubts it. His comment about her using her body for posts might undermine her efforts and come off as condescending. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns about shared financial responsibilities and wants to avoid future issues. But the key is how to address those concerns without belittling the other person. So while the underlying issue is about responsibility, the execution was poor, which could make the author at fault in terms of communication and respect.\n"
