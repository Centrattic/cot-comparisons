She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a guy in a relationship with a girl who's graduating with a master's degree but has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k allowance a month, and she plans to use that plus her Instagram for income when they move in together. He's pushing her to get a job, which makes sense because relying on family money and affiliate marketing might not be reliable for shared living expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's argument is about responsibility and financial stability. He's concerned that her current plan might not cover their expenses, and he wants her to be independent. He's also worried that she might expect him to cover her if things don't go as planned. That seems reasonable because financial responsibilities in a relationship need to be clear. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl might feel that his comments are dismissive of her efforts. She's trying to use her Instagram for income, which is a legitimate side hustle for some people. His remark about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" could come off as condescending and disrespectful, even if his intention was to question the viability of her income source. That kind of comment can hurt her feelings and undermine her efforts. \n\nAlso, their communication style is important. He might have approached the conversation in a way that's accusatory instead of supportive. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or that they should \"act like an adult\" without offering encouragement or practical support can be demoralizing. It's possible he didn't consider her perspective or the pressure she's under to transition from academia to work life.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. He's earning $70k this year, while she's just starting out. He's not in a position to financially support her long-term, so pushing her to become self-sufficient makes sense. However, the way he's doing it could be the issue. Criticizing her life choices and implying she's lazy might not be the best approach, even if his intentions are good.\n\nI should also think about societal expectations. It's common for people to rely on family support while pursuing education, but moving out and sharing expenses requires financial independence. His concern is valid, but the method of communication might have been too harsh. The key here is whether his criticism was constructive or just a personal attack.\n\nIn summary, while his intentions might be to help her become responsible, the way he expressed it could have been hurtful and disrespectful. The girl's reaction is understandable if he made her feel belittled. So, the answer might hinge on whether his criticism was well-meaning but poorly delivered, making him at least partially at fault for the way he communicated his concerns.\n"
