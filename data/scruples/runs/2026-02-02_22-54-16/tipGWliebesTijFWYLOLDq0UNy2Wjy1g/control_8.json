She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she needs to become more productive and get a job. So, the situation is that the girlfriend is about to finish her master's, never had a job, and her family gives her a $1k+ allowance. She wants to move in with him and pay half the rent using her allowance and expanding her Instagram for income. The author is against it, thinks she should get a job, and called her out for not working, which upset her.\n\nHmm, first, the author's main point is about responsibility and financial independence. He's concerned that relying on her parents' allowance and affiliate marketing isn't sustainable. He's trying to be realistic, maybe because he's working and making $70k. But he also made some harsh comments, like saying she's a \"bum\" and that her friends are not in the real world. That part might be offensive.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a right to her own financial choices. Maybe she's confident in her ability to monetize her Instagram, even if it's not traditional work. The author's push for her to get a job could be seen as dismissive of her plans and aspirations. Also, the way he communicated his concerns was harsh, leading to her feeling hurt and called names. \n\nSo, the question is about accountability. Is it wrong to encourage someone to be financially responsible? Or is the way he approached it the problem? If the author had expressed his concerns respectfully, maybe there would be less conflict. But he did make personal attacks, which isn't good. Even if his intentions are about financial stability, the method matters. \n\nAlso, considering their relationship, it's important to balance personal goals with mutual respect. The girlfriend's choice to focus on her Instagram might be a valid career path for her, even if others don't see it that way. The author might not be wrong in his perspective, but his delivery and the harsh words likely made him the asshole in the situation.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the disrespectful communication and the personal attacks, even if his concerns are valid.\n"
