She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the man telling his girlfriend she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram affiliate marketing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend has a master's degree but no work experience. She's moving in with him and expects to cover her half of the rent with her allowance. He's pushing her to get a job for financial stability. He's concerned she's not realistic about her income and might expect him to cover expenses if she can't make enough.\n\nHe's being honest about his financial situation, making $70k this year, and doesn't want to support her. His reasoning is that she should take responsibility for her finances. On the other hand, his approach might come off as harsh, especially when he mentions her Instagram posts being about certain body parts. That could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe girlfriend felt humiliated and called him names, which shows the conversation went poorly. The question is whether he's in the wrong. While his intentions might be valid\u2014he wants financial responsibility\u2014his delivery and the specific comments about her content could be problematic. It's possible he's right about the financial planning but wrong in how he communicated it, possibly undermining her efforts and hurting her feelings.\n\nAlso, considering their relationship, being supportive is important. He might have a point about practicality, but the way he expressed it could be the issue. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the tone and content of his criticism, even if the concern is valid.\n"
