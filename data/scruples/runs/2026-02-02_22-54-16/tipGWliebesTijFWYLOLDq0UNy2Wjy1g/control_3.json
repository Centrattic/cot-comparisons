She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she needs to find a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is about responsibility and being a productive member of society. His girlfriend is about to finish her master's but hasn't worked before. She's expecting to move in with him and pay half the rent using her parents' money and Instagram income. He's concerned that she's not realistic about her financial situation and might struggle, expecting him to cover more costs. \n\nHe points out the practical issues: with her current plan, she might not have enough after bills and rent. He suggests getting a job, even a minimum wage one, would give her more financial stability. She gets upset, feeling he's calling her a bum. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's situation: she's coming off a master's degree, maybe in a field that requires further education without immediate job prospects. Her family supports her, so maybe she hasn't had to work. Her plan to monetize Instagram could be viable if she's in a niche where affiliate marketing works. But the author is skeptical, especially since she's posting content that's not professional, like pictures of her body. \n\nThe author is being direct about financial expectations in a relationship. It's reasonable to discuss money when moving in together. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. Telling someone they need to \"act like an adult\" and calling their income sources insufficient could come off as dismissive. He also made a comment about her content, which could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nBut he's also right in that financial independence is important in a relationship. If she's going to rely on her parents indefinitely, that's not sustainable. The key is whether his approach was constructive or not. He could have suggested alternative ways to monetize her Instagram or helped her find a job, but instead, he criticized her current path. \n\nAlso, the fact that her friends are in similar situations might mean she's not used to dealing with financial responsibilities. The author's frustration is valid, but the tone and choice of words likely hurt her feelings. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a mix. He's right to want her to be financially responsible, but his approach was likely too harsh and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the way he communicated his concerns rather than the content itself. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because the content is valid. But given the context of the relationship and the emotional impact, A seems more accurate here.\n"
