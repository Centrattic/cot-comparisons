She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to finish her master's, has never had a job, lives with her affluent parents, and wants to move in with the author, paying half the rent using her allowance and plans to make money through Instagram affiliate marketing. The author advised her to get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned about financial stability and independence. The girlfriend's plan to rely on allowance and Instagram might not be sustainable, and the author is trying to be realistic. But the way he expressed it might be harsh. He called her a \"bum,\" compared her Instagram content negatively, and criticized her friends. That could have been hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to set realistic expectations, especially about shared financial responsibilities. It's reasonable to discuss financial plans when moving in together. However, the tone and choice of words matter. The author might not be in the wrong for the content of the message but could be for the delivery. However, in AITA scenarios, sometimes the content is more important than the delivery if the criticism is valid. The author's concern about her not working is a legitimate issue when considering their future together. So, it's a bit of a balance between being right about the financial practicality and being respectful in communication.\n\nI think the key points are whether the author's concerns are valid (yes, they are) and whether the way he expressed them crossed a line. The answer might swing towards the author not being in the wrong because his advice is about financial responsibility, but others might see it as dismissive. However, in AITA, if the advice is sound even if delivered poorly, it's often considered not the person's fault. So, leaning towards B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
