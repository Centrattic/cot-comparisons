She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. From the story, the girlfriend is about to get her master's but has never had a job. She's getting a monthly allowance from her parents, which she plans to use for rent when moving in. The author argues she should get a job instead of relying on her parents and affiliate marketing, which he doubts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to be independent. He's planning to make $70k this year and doesn't want to cover her expenses. His main point is that she should work to gain real-world experience and financial stability.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is coming from a supportive family and has a different approach, relying on her parents' allowance and social media. She got upset because she felt criticized and labeled as a \"bum.\" The author's tone might come off as harsh, especially when he mentions her posting certain content and calling her friends not in the real world. That could be seen as dismissive of her aspirations or not valuing her skills or interests in affiliate marketing.\n\nThe key points here are communication style, respect for her choices, and the reality of their living situation. The author is pushing for responsibility, which is valid, but the way he delivered it might have been insensitive. He didn't provide support for her alternative path but instead criticized her family and her methods. This could be where he's in the wrong\u2014maybe he should have discussed practical concerns without belittling her or her family.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's right to choose her path isn't absolute, but the author's approach could have been more collaborative. The fact that she's transitioning from academia to working life is a big step, and his reaction might not take into account her current phase in life. He might be right about the financial practicalities, but the manner of his communication is a problem.\n\nSo, balancing his valid concerns about financial independence with the way he expressed them, the answer might be that he's partially in the wrong because of the harsh delivery and lack of support. However, the question is whether he's \"in the wrong\" overall. The options are A or B. Given that he had a valid concern but communicated it poorly, the answer could be A (in the wrong) because of the way he handled it, not the content of his message. Alternatively, if the main issue is the content, then B. But the emotional impact and communication style are significant here.\n"
