She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on an allowance, and planning to move in with the author while using her Instagram for income. The author is pushing her to get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is graduating with a master's but has no work experience. Her family is financially secure, giving her a $1k allowance. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to work, not rely on her parents or unreliable income from social media. \n\nThe author's arguments are about financial stability, independence, and realistic expectations. He points out that relying on allowance and affiliate marketing (which might not be lucrative) could lead to financial strain. He also mentions that without a job, she might struggle to cover expenses after rent and bills. His intention seems to be about preparing her for adult responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels the author is criticizing her lifestyle and implying she's a \"bum.\" The author's comment about her posts being \"pics of her ass and tits\" comes off as dismissive and possibly hurtful. Even if he's right about the financial concerns, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. \n\nThe key here is whether his advice was right but delivered inconsiderately. While his concerns are valid (financial planning, real-world experience), the manner in which he expressed them\u2014calling her a non-adult, making a derogatory comment about her content\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. It's possible he's right about the financial aspect but wrong in the delivery, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely wrong in his reasoning, the way he handled the conversation might make him at least partially responsible for the conflict. However, the core issue of financial responsibility isn't his fault. The answer hinges on whether the wrong lies in the content or the delivery. Given that the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" the answer might lean towards B (not wrong) because the advice itself is sound, but there's room to argue that the approach was flawed. However, in AITA contexts, the community often considers both the validity of the advice and the manner. If the advice is right but delivered poorly, it's still a nuanced answer. But the question is straightforward: is the author in the wrong? If the advice is correct, then the answer is B. If the method is wrong, it's A. The user says they think the author is not in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B.\n"
