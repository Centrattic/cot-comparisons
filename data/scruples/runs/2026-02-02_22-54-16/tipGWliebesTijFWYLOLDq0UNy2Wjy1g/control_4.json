She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 22-year-old guy and his 23-year-old girlfriend who is about to finish her master's degree but has never had a job. Her family provides her with a $1k monthly allowance, and she plans to move in with him, using her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing to cover expenses. The guy is pushing her to get a job, warning her about financial struggles and not relying on her parents' money. She got upset and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy is concerned about their financial future. He's renting an apartment alone and expects her to contribute half the rent and bills. He's worried she's not realistic about her financial plan, relying on allowance and social media income which might not be stable. His main point is about responsibility and transitioning into the real world. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has just finished a master's program and hasn't worked before. Her family provides a decent allowance, and she's planning to monetize her Instagram, which isn't a traditional job but might be feasible. She's upset because she feels criticized for her lifestyle and choices. \n\nThe guy's approach might come off as harsh. Telling someone they're not acting like an adult and implying they're a \"bum\" could be hurtful. However, his concerns are valid. Financial stability is crucial in a relationship, and expecting her to manage without a job might lead to problems. The way he communicated his concerns might be the issue here. Instead of being confrontational, a more supportive approach could have helped her transition into the workforce without making her feel attacked. \n\nAlso, the mention of her Instagram content (posts of her body) could be a sensitive point. While he's not wrong to question the sustainability of that income, the way he phrased it might have been disrespectful, even if he meant it as a critique of the method. \n\nConsidering all this, the guy has valid concerns but handled the conversation poorly. He didn't consider her feelings or the pressure she might be under. The right approach would have been to discuss the financial plan collaboratively, encouraging her to find a job while being empathetic to her situation. Therefore, he's partially in the wrong for the way he communicated, but not entirely because his intentions were about financial responsibility. However, in AITA scenarios, the tone and delivery often matter more than the content. So the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the harsh communication style and the hurtful comments, even if his concerns are legitimate.\n"
