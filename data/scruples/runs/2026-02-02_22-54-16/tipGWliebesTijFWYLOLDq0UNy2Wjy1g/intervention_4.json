She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, a 22-year-old man, telling his 23-year-old girlfriend that she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing to cover their shared living expenses. She's about to finish her master's degree with no work history, and her family is financially well-off.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that his girlfriend isn't being responsible by not having a job. He's concerned about their financial stability if she relies on her parents and affiliate income. He's pushing her to enter the workforce, which he sees as necessary for a sustainable future. He also points out that her current approach might not be realistic, especially if she expects him to cover the costs if things go wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is defensive. She's in school, about to graduate, and perhaps hasn't had the opportunity to work yet. Her family's financial support is a given, so she might not see the immediate need to take on a job. Her plans for affiliate marketing might be her way of trying to earn money, even if it's not traditional. The author's criticism might come off as dismissive or disrespectful, especially when he comments on her Instagram content, which could be a sensitive topic.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations in a relationship regarding financial responsibility and independence. The author is advocating for practical steps towards self-sufficiency, which is a valid concern. However, his tone and the way he delivered his message could have been more respectful. Insulting her aspirations and making comments about her content might have been unnecessarily harsh, leading to her feeling belittled.\n\nFinancial independence is important, but how one communicates about it can affect the relationship dynamics. The author's approach, while well-intentioned, might have lacked sensitivity. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt attacked, which could be a valid response if she perceives his comments as undermining her efforts or her worth.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author's intentions are good\u2014encouraging responsibility\u2014but the method could be improved. Therefore, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but there's room for him to reflect on his communication style.\n"
