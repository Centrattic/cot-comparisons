She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a guy in a relationship with a woman who's about to finish her master's but never had a job. She wants to move in with him, but he's pushing her to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about their financial future together. He's worried that if she relies on her parents' money and affiliate marketing (which he's skeptical about), they might struggle financially. He's suggesting she gets a job, even a minimum wage one, to have a stable income. His reasoning is practical: if she works, she can contribute more, save, and not depend on him. He also mentions that she might end up with little money after rent and bills, which isn't sustainable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because he made her feel like a failure. She's in a program that requires a master's, so maybe she's been able to avoid working until now. Her family's financial support allows her to focus on studies, and she's planning to monetize her Instagram, which some people do successfully. The author's dismissive comments about her content (posts of her body) might have been hurtful, even if his intentions were to encourage her to be practical. \n\nI should consider if his approach was harsh. Telling someone they're not a \"productive member of society\" and implying they're a \"bum\" could be seen as disrespectful. While his concerns are valid, the way he communicated them might have been insensitive. Relationships require communication, and his feedback was given in a critical tone, leading to her feeling attacked. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's plan isn't impossible. Affiliate marketing can work, especially with a growing following. However, relying solely on that might be risky. The author's push for a job might be valid, but he needs to approach it with empathy. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a balance. His intentions are good, but the method could be better. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and the options are A (Yes) or B (No), I think the answer leans toward B because his advice isn't inherently wrong, but the delivery could be improved. However, some might argue that he crossed a line by making her feel bad. But overall, his financial concerns are reasonable, so he's not entirely in the wrong.\n"
