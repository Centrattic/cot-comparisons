She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is telling his girlfriend she needs to become more productive and get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's, hasn't worked a job before, and plans to use her parents' money and Instagram for income if they move in together. The guy is against that, wants her to get a job, and she got upset and called him names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is about responsibility and financial independence. He wants her to work, which is a common expectation in society. But he also called her out for relying on her parents, which might be a sensitive issue. The girlfriend's side is that she's moving to a new place, and maybe she feels pressured or criticized for her lifestyle. Her parents are supportive, giving her an allowance, which might be a family choice. \n\nThe guy mentions she's going to expand her Instagram, which he views negatively because of the content she's posting. That part could be problematic. Judging her based on the type of content she's creating might be unfair. He's making assumptions about her Instagram strategy and dismissing her potential to make money that way. Maybe he's right that affiliate marketing isn't reliable, but he shouldn't have made a comment about her content being inappropriate. That could be a big reason why she got upset. \n\nAlso, the way he approached the conversation is important. He told her she's not being an adult, which could come off as condescending. Even if his intentions were good, the delivery might have been harsh. People often react badly when they feel criticized, especially in a relationship. The girlfriend might not be ready to take on the financial responsibilities he's suggesting, or she might feel that her path is valid. \n\nFinancial independence is a valid concern, but the method of addressing it matters. The guy's approach might have been too direct or judgmental. He could have discussed alternatives more constructively instead of criticizing her current situation. The part about her friends and their wealth is another point; maybe he's projecting his own values onto her without considering her background. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's judgment of her Instagram content, the condescending tone implying she's not an adult, and dismissing her financial plan without understanding her perspective. These factors could make him the asshole here. However, wanting her to be financially responsible isn't wrong. It's the approach that's questionable. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his comments about her Instagram content and the way he criticized her without considering her feelings were unkind. Even if he has valid concerns, the way he expressed them caused hurt, which is a common issue in relationships when discussing sensitive topics like finances.\n"
