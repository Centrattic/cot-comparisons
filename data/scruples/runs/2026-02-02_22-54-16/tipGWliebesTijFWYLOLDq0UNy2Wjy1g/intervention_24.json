She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The scenario involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and planning to move in with the author. The author is concerned about her financial stability and wants her to get a job, which leads to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is worried about their financial future together. They think the girlfriend's plan to rely on her parents and Instagram isn't sustainable. The girlfriend feels criticized and unsupported, which led to her being upset. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're being responsible and realistic. They're pointing out the practical issues of living together if she doesn't have a stable income. It's valid to want a partner who can contribute financially, especially if you're planning to cohabitate. The author is also concerned about future savings and not wanting to be the one supporting both financially, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her aspirations (like Instagram affiliate marketing) are being dismissed. Maybe she sees that as a valid path, and the author's comments about her content could come off as disrespectful. The way the author phrased things might have been harsh, even if the intention was to be honest. Calling her a \"bum\" or making comments about her content might have been hurtful, even if the message was about responsibility.\n\nBut the core issue is financial responsibility and differing life goals. The author is advocating for a more traditional approach to work, while the girlfriend is pursuing a different path. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their criticism was constructive or just harsh. They did raise valid concerns about financial stability, but the manner in which they communicated it might have been insensitive.\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters a lot. Even if the message is correct, the delivery can affect how it's received. If the author's tone was condescending or dismissive of her plans, that could be where the issue lies. However, the author's concerns are legitimate about financial planning when moving in together. \n\nSo, balancing the financial reality with respect for each other's perspectives is key. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting her to be employed, but they might need to approach the conversation with more empathy. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for the situation as presented. Since the main issue is financial responsibility and the author's concerns are valid, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The problem might be more about communication than the content of the message.\n"
