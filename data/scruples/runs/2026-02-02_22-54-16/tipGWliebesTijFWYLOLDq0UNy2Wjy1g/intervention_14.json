She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's, has never had a job, gets an allowance from her parents, and wants to rely on that plus her Instagram affiliate marketing to cover moving in with him. The author is pushing her to get a job instead of relying on her parents and social media.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's concerned about financial responsibility. He's not okay with her not contributing properly and wants her to be independent. He's worried about their future together if she's not making a stable income. His intentions seem to be based on wanting her to be responsible and not rely on others.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is being harsh and dismissive. She's transitioning from a sheltered life where her family supports her, and maybe she's not ready for the sudden push into a more traditional work environment. Her using Instagram could be a valid attempt to monetize her skills, even if it's not as stable as a job. The author's comments about her content being \"pics of her ass and tits\" might come off as disrespectful, even if he's making a point about the feasibility of that income.\n\nThe key points here are communication, respect, and expectations. The author's approach might be seen as confrontational, especially if he criticized her choices and friends' lifestyles. Even if his concerns are valid, the way he expressed them could have hurt her feelings. The girlfriend might feel that her efforts (like starting affiliate marketing) are being undervalued, and the author's tone could have made her feel attacked.\n\nFinancial independence is important, but how it's approached matters. The author could have discussed this with more empathy, understanding her aspirations, and perhaps exploring realistic steps together. Instead of dismissing her plans, he might have offered support or alternative ideas. The fact that she got upset and felt like a \"bum\" suggests that his approach was hurtful, regardless of his good intentions.\n\nSo, while the author's concerns about financial stability are valid, the way he communicated them might have been the issue. There's a balance between being honest and being respectful. The answer here might hinge on whether the criticism was constructive or just harsh. Since the author's words led to emotional distress and he used a derogatory comment about her content, it's possible he's in the wrong for not handling the conversation more sensitively.\n"
