She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is about to finish her master's degree. She hasn't had a job before, and her family is financially well-off. She gets around $1,000 a month as an allowance. They're planning to move in together, and the author expects her to pay half the rent and bills. She says she'll use her parents' allowance and expand her Instagram for income. The author thinks she should get a job instead, pointing out that relying on Instagram for income isn't reliable and that she might struggle financially. He mentions that she doesn't realize the financial challenges and that she might expect him to cover expenses. She got upset and accused him of making her feel like a bum. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the arguments from both sides. The author's perspective is about financial responsibility and preparing for real-world challenges. He's concerned that relying on Instagram and her parents' allowance isn't sustainable. He's also worried about their financial compatibility if she doesn't contribute adequately. His intention might be to set realistic expectations for their future together.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her contributions (like her Instagram) are valid and that the author is dismissive of her efforts. She might feel that the author is being harsh by not supporting her chosen path. The fact that she hasn't had a job before could make her defensive about the author's comments. Also, the allowance from her parents might be a source of tension, as she might not want to be seen as dependent.\n\nNow, considering the author's approach: he directly addressed the financial expectations, which is important when moving in together. However, the way he communicated might have been harsh. Phrases like \"just go to school for no reason\" or comments about her Instagram posts could come off as dismissive and disrespectful. Even if his intentions are good, the tone matters in a relationship. He might have been too critical without acknowledging her efforts or considering her perspective.\n\nFinancial expectations are a valid topic to discuss, especially before moving in. It's reasonable for him to want her to contribute to shared expenses. However, the way he expressed his concerns might have been lacking in empathy. Relationships require compromise and understanding, and the author could have approached the conversation with more supportiveness. Instead, his comments about her not being in the \"real world\" and his sarcastic remarks about her Instagram content could have been hurtful. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt the conversation was attacking her lifestyle or choices. If the author's intention was to encourage her to be financially independent, a more constructive approach might have been to discuss realistic steps she could take, like part-time work alongside her Instagram, rather than outright dismissing her plans. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's not clear whether the author is wrong for expressing his concerns. However, the manner in which he did so might have caused unnecessary hurt. Relationships often involve tough conversations about money, and how these are handled can affect the relationship's health. The key issue here is whether the criticism was constructive or just critical without support.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for bringing up financial expectations, but his delivery was likely harsh and disrespectful, which could be seen as the problem. Therefore, the answer might be that he is in the wrong (A) because of the way he communicated his concerns rather than the content of the concerns themselves.\n"
