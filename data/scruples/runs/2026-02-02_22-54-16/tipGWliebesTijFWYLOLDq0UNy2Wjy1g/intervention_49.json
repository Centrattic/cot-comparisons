She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the guy telling his girlfriend to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and social media income. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy is concerned about financial responsibility. He's paying rent and wants her to contribute fairly. He's worried that if she moves in, she'll rely on her parents and maybe not take the financial responsibilities seriously. He's not wrong to be concerned about splitting costs and future stability.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's degree and hasn't worked before. She's planning to move in and use her allowance and social media for income. The guy's comments might have come off as harsh, especially calling her a \"bum\" and criticizing her for things like posting certain content. That could definitely hurt her feelings, even if his intentions were good.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? He's not forcing her to do anything; he's expressing his concerns about their future living arrangements. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been insensitive. Instead of being supportive, he criticized her choices and friends, which led to her feeling upset. \n\nThe key points here are communication style and mutual respect. Even if his reasoning is valid, the way he delivered it could have been more empathetic. It's important in relationships to consider how your words affect the other person. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but the approach could have been better. \n\nGiven the options, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's addressing valid financial concerns, but it's a close call. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and while his communication could have been better, the core issue of wanting her to be financially responsible isn't inherently wrong.\n"
