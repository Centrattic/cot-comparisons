She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple discussing moving in together and financial responsibilities. The man is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's, has never worked a job, and relies on her parents' allowance. He's okay with her moving in and paying half the rent, but when she says she'll use her parents' money and Instagram affiliate marketing, he pushes back and insists she get a job. She gets upset, feeling he's judging her and making her feel like a failure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man's concern is about financial responsibility and stability. He's worried that relying on her parents' allowance and an unreliable income source (Instagram) isn't sustainable. He's also concerned about her not having a job despite his own earnings. She's coming from a family that can support her, but moving in together might require financial independence.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being critical of her lifestyle choices. He's calling her a \"bum\" and making comments about her Instagram content, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if his intentions are to encourage responsibility, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that his approach hurt her feelings and made her feel undervalued.\n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. Some might see his push for her to get a job as supportive, wanting her to be independent. Others might argue that he's being controlling or not respecting her path, especially since her family can support her. The fact that she's in a graduate program and hasn't worked before might mean she's transitioning into the workforce, which can be a learning process.\n\nThe man's comment about her Instagram content is problematic. It's disrespectful to mock someone's attempts at income generation, even if he doubts its effectiveness. That part of the conversation was clearly hurtful and could be seen as condescending.\n\nIn terms of financial responsibility, it's reasonable for him to want her to contribute fairly. However, his approach might have been too abrupt and lacking in empathy. Maybe he could have suggested exploring job opportunities together or helping her find a position that aligns with her skills from her master's program. Instead, his tone was more critical, which led to conflict.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's financial situation is complex. Relying on a parental allowance isn't necessarily wrong, especially if her family can afford it. However, transitioning to financial independence is a common step in relationships. The man's concern about future sustainability is valid, but his delivery was harsh.\n\nIn conclusion, the man has valid concerns about financial stability, but his method of addressing them was inappropriate. The key issue is how he communicated his points, which was disrespectful and dismissive of her feelings and efforts. Therefore, he's in the wrong for his approach, even if his intentions were to support their future together. The answer should be A.\n"
