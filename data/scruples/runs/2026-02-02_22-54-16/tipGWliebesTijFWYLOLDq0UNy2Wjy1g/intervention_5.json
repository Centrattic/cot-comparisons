She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the man telling his girlfriend she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman is about to graduate with a master's, has never had a job, gets a $1k+ allowance, and plans to move in with her boyfriend. She wants to cover half the rent and bills with her allowance and make money through Instagram. The man is against this, argues she should get a job, and mentions not wanting to cover her expenses. She's upset, feeling judged and called a \"bum.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the man) is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, he's concerned about financial responsibility and shared living costs. He's suggesting practical steps she can take, like getting a job, which makes sense for someone preparing to live independently. On the other hand, his approach might come off as harsh. He criticized her current plans, called her out for not working, and even made a comment about her using Instagram posts (implying she's using her looks to make money). That could be hurtful, even if his intentions are valid.\n\nFinancial independence is a common expectation in relationships, especially when cohabiting. The man is right in wanting both to contribute equally. However, the way he delivered his message might have been insensitive. He didn't offer support for her to start looking for a job or help her transition into the workforce. Instead, he criticized her lifestyle and friends' situations, which could make her feel attacked. \n\nAlso, the comment about her Instagram posts being about \"pics of her ass and tits\" is not only rude but also dismissive of her efforts. Even if he's skeptical about her ability to make money that way, it's not his place to make such a personal and derogatory remark. That part definitely crosses a line and could be seen as the man being in the wrong.\n\nHowever, his main point about her needing to be financially responsible isn't without merit. The problem lies in the delivery and the condescension. So, while his intentions might be correct, his method of communication is flawed. The balance here is tricky. He's right to want her to be responsible, but he's wrong in his approach and the harshness of his words.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both intentions and actions. The man's intentions are good\u2014he wants her to be independent and not rely on him or her parents. But his actions were hurtful and not supportive. The woman might need encouragement to find a job rather than criticism. The man could have approached it by discussing her goals, offering help in job searching, or expressing concerns about their financial future together without belittling her current situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the man is partially in the wrong for the way he handled the conversation but not entirely. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong at all. The answer would likely be A (Yes) because his communication was hurtful and unhelpful, even if his concerns were valid. The key is that his approach could have been more constructive and respectful.\n"
