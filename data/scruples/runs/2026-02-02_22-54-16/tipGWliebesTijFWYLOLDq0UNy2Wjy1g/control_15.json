She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is relying on her parents' allowance and wants to move in with the author, expecting to pay half the rent with her allowance and some affiliate marketing. The author told her she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents and the idea of making money through social media.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial stability and the girlfriend's lack of real-world experience. He's worried she's not planning realistically and might end up in financial trouble. From his perspective, he's trying to be responsible and set realistic expectations. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh, especially the part about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits.\" That's probably where the main conflict lies. He used a derogatory comment about her content, which could have been hurtful and dismissive of her efforts. \n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, feels her aspirations are being dismissed. She's trying to transition from academia to the workforce and is exploring different income streams. Her family's financial support is a given, but she might see it as her choice to rely on that support, especially if she's planning to work part-time or through affiliate marketing. The author's criticism of her friends not being in the real world might also come across as judgmental, implying that her social circle is part of the problem. \n\nFinancial independence is important, but the tone and approach matter. The author's comment about her content could be seen as condescending and not supportive. Even if his intentions were good, the way he delivered his message might have made her feel attacked rather than advised. The girlfriend's reaction of feeling like a \"bum\" suggests that the criticism hit a sensitive nerve, possibly because she's struggling with self-esteem or the pressure to change her lifestyle.\n\nAlso, considering their relationship, the author's role as a partner is to support and encourage, not to belittle her choices. The fact that she's moving in with him and contributing half the rent is a step towards independence, but the author's harshness might undermine that. The key issue here is the communication style rather than the content of the advice itself. It's possible he's right about the financial concerns, but the way he expressed it is what caused the conflict.\n\nIn summary, while there might be valid concerns about financial responsibility, the author's approach was disrespectful. The derogatory remark about her social media content is a significant factor in determining fault. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
