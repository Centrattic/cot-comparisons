She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about his girlfriend wanting to move in with him but relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income. He told her she needs to get a job, and she was upset. So, the question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The man is concerned about financial stability. He's renting an apartment and expects her to cover half the rent and bills. He's advising her to get a job because relying on her parents and affiliate marketing might not be enough. He mentions that even a minimum wage job would give her more stability. He also points out the potential struggle with expenses and that she might expect him to cover the shortfall. His intentions seem to be about responsibility and practicality.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is graduating with a master's degree but hasn't worked. She's using her parents' allowance and wants to pursue Instagram for income. She got upset when he criticized her approach, feeling judged. She might feel that he's being overly critical or not supportive of her chosen path, even if it's unconventional.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationships, partners often discuss financial responsibilities. The man is setting boundaries by saying he won't cover her expenses if she can't contribute. That's reasonable. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum\" and made a derogatory comment about her Instagram content, which could have been hurtful. Even if his intentions were good, the delivery could have been more supportive.\n\nFinancial independence is important in relationships. He's right to want her to have her own income, especially since moving in together involves shared expenses. But the approach might have been too confrontational. It's possible that she felt criticized without understanding the pressure she's under from her family's financial support.\n\nAlso, her pursuing affiliate marketing isn't inherently wrong, though it's uncertain. Many people start businesses or side hustles. However, relying solely on that without a backup plan can be risky, which he's pointing out. The conflict arises from differing views on financial responsibility versus supporting her ambitions.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the man is advocating for financial prudence, which is valid. However, he might be in the wrong if his communication lacked empathy or respect. The key is whether his tone and words were considerate of her feelings and her perspective. If he was dismissive or made her feel belittled, that's problematic.\n\nSo, balancing the need for practicality with kindness is crucial. The answer might depend on whether the criticism was constructive or just harsh. The user might be at fault for not handling the conversation more gently, even if his points were valid.\n"
