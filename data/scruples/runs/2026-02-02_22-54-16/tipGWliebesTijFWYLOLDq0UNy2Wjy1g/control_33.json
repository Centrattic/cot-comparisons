She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy (M22) telling his girlfriend (F23) she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income. They're planning to move in together, and he's concerned she's not being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy is being responsible, right? He wants her to have a stable income. Her relying on her parents' money and affiliate marketing might not be reliable. But he called her a bum and criticized her Instagram posts, which might be harsh. \n\nHe's not wrong about the financial instability. If she moves in, depending on that allowance and uncertain income could lead to problems. But the way he communicated it might have been hurtful. He said \"posting pics of her ass and tits\" which is disrespectful. Even if he's trying to be honest, the tone matters. \n\nHer reaction is understandable because he made her feel attacked. Maybe he should have approached it more kindly, focusing on their future together instead of belittling her. So he's partly right in the concern but wrong in the delivery. \n\nBut is he in the wrong overall? The question is whether he's at fault. If the advice is valid but the delivery is poor, does that make him wrong? In relationships, communication is key. Even if the point is valid, being harsh can damage trust. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his approach was disrespectful and hurtful, even if his concerns are valid.\n"
