She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a 22-year-old guy in a relationship with a 23-year-old woman who's about to graduate with her master's. She's never had a job before, lives with her well-off parents who give her a $1k+ monthly allowance. She wants to move in with him, and he's okay with her paying half the rent. But when he asks how she'll cover her half, she says she'll use her allowance and expand her Instagram for affiliate marketing. He's against that, telling her she should get a job instead. She gets upset and feels he's being harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman has never worked, is relying on her parents' money, and is planning to move in with her boyfriend. The author is concerned about financial responsibilities when they live together. He's worried that if she doesn't get a job, they might struggle financially, and he doesn't want to end up supporting her. His reasoning is that she should be financially independent, which is a valid concern in a relationship where both partners are supposed to contribute.\n\nBut then, how he communicates this is important. He called her a \"bum\" and said she goes to school for no reason, which could be seen as disrespectful. He also made a comment about the content of her Instagram (posts of \"ass and tits\") implying that she's not serious about making money through that. That's probably hurtful and dismissive of her efforts. Even if he's right about the financial aspect, the way he delivered the message might have been harsh and degrading. \n\nThe woman's reaction is sadness and feeling belittled. She might feel that he's criticizing her lifestyle and not respecting her choices. She's about to graduate with a master's degree, so she might have aspirations that he's not considering. Maybe she has plans post-graduation that she hasn't shared yet. The author's approach seems confrontational rather than collaborative. Instead of discussing options together, he's telling her what she needs to do, which could damage the relationship's dynamics.\n\nHowever, the author is also trying to be realistic. Financial stability is crucial in a relationship, especially cohabitation. His concern that she might not be able to cover her half and that he won't support her is valid. But the way he expressed it could be improved. Instead of attacking her current situation and her Instagram content, he could have suggested compromise or explored other avenues for her employment or financial planning.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The key points are the disrespectful comments about her Instagram and calling her a \"bum,\" which are likely the main reasons she felt offended. While his intentions might be good, the method of communication was poor. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the harsh and demeaning way he communicated his concerns rather than the concerns themselves.\n"
