She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The scenario involves financial expectations and differing views on work and independence.\n\nFirst, the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's graduating with a master's but has never had a job. Her family is wealthy, providing her with a $1k+ allowance. They plan to move in together, and he's concerned about her relying on her parents' money and her Instagram affiliate marketing as a primary income source. He wants her to get a job for financial stability. She feels criticized and upset, calling him names.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is expressing his concerns about their financial future. He's not wrong to want her to be financially independent, especially if they're moving in together. But how he communicated this might be the issue. He called her a \"bum,\" criticized her friends' lifestyles, and made a comment about her using Instagram for affiliate marketing, implying she's posting inappropriate content. That's where the potential for hurt feelings comes in. \n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute financially in a shared living situation. On the other hand, the way he expressed his concerns\u2014using harsh language, making assumptions about her content, and belittling her friends\u2014could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. He's projecting his own values onto her without considering her perspective or the pressure she might be under from her family. \n\nAlso, she's transitioning from a life of financial support to independence, which is a significant change. His approach might not be supportive enough. While his intentions might be valid, the method of communication is problematic. It's possible he's right about the practical need for a job but wrong in how he delivered his message, leading to the conflict. \n\nSo, balancing the practicality of his concerns against the sensitivity of his approach, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the manner in which he conveyed his message, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n"
