She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy named M22, and his girlfriend is F23. She's about to get a master's degree but has never had a job. Her family is wealthy\u2014her dad is a dentist, her mom an accountant\u2014and they give her over $1,000 a month. She wants to move in with him, and he agreed she'd pay half the rent. When he asked how she'll cover her half, she said her allowance will cover rent and bills, and she'll make money through expanding her Instagram (which has 8k followers) via affiliate marketing. The author is against this, telling her she needs a real job, to become a productive member of society. He argues that with her allowance and a minimum wage job, she could save and not struggle. He also mentions she might expect him to pay for things, even though he makes $70k this year. He criticized her friends for not being in the real world and her relying on her family. She got upset, feeling he called her a bum, and they had a fight.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. He's concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to be independent. He's sharing his opinion that relying on family money and Instagram isn't sufficient for her to be financially stable. He wants her to have a job, which is a common expectation in many societies. He's also being upfront about not wanting to support her financially beyond splitting the rent, which is fair if they're moving in together. His comments might be harsh, but his intentions seem to be about preparing her for adulthood and avoiding dependency.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's perspective is that she's about to finish her master's and has a plan, albeit unconventional. Her family's financial support is a given, and she's using her Instagram as a potential income source. The author's criticism might make her feel judged, especially if she's not used to such direct feedback. Her reaction of feeling called a \"bum\" suggests that the way he communicated his concerns was hurtful. His comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful, even if he's trying to be honest. That part might be problematic because it reduces her efforts to just her appearance, which is not constructive feedback.\n\nThe key points here are communication style and the validity of his concerns. While his intentions may be good (wanting her to be independent), his approach was harsh and possibly degrading. The way he phrased some comments, especially about her using Instagram for affiliate marketing by posting certain content, could be seen as belittling her efforts. Financial independence is important, but the method of communication matters. If he was supportive of her exploring different income sources while encouraging a job, maybe the conversation would have been more productive. Instead, his approach came off as judgmental, leading to her feeling attacked.\n\nAlso, considering that she's coming from a wealthy family, the author might have different financial expectations. However, it's reasonable to expect her to contribute to shared expenses in a relationship, and his stance on that isn't wrong. The issue is more about how he expressed his concerns and the respect given to her plans. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author isn't entirely wrong in his concerns about financial responsibility, but his delivery was hurtful and disrespectful. That makes his actions contribute to the conflict, which means he might be at least partially in the wrong. However, the core issue of wanting her to be financially independent isn't wrong. The answer might depend on whether the focus is on the content of his message or the delivery. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and given that his communication style was harsh and disrespectful, especially the part about her Instagram posts, I think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because of how he conveyed his message rather than the content itself.\n"
