She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's, has never worked a job, gets an allowance from her parents, and plans to use that plus her Instagram for income. The author is pushing her to get a job, which leads to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The author is concerned about financial stability and responsibility. He wants her to work, which is a reasonable expectation, especially since they plan to live together. He's not taking her money; he's asking her to contribute equally. His reasoning is practical\u2014like saving money and being independent instead of relying on family or affiliate marketing.\n\nThe girlfriend is coming from a wealthy family, so she hasn't had to work. Her plan relies on her parents' allowance and an uncertain income from Instagram. The author is pointing out the reality of financial planning, which might be something she hasn't considered. He's not forcing her to get a specific job, just suggesting she should work. His comments about her using Instagram for \"pics of her ass and tits\" might be harsh, but the main issue is the lack of a stable income.\n\nHowever, there's a communication problem here. The author could have approached it more sensitively. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" isn't helpful. He expressed his concerns, which is valid, but maybe the way he did it wasn't supportive. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable if she feels criticized. But the core issue is about financial responsibility. The author is right in wanting her to be financially independent, but he might need to work on how he communicates that.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think not. He's advocating for responsibility and independence, which are positive traits. However, the manner in which he communicated could be improved. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for the content of his message, not the delivery. Since the content is valid, even if the delivery is harsh, the answer would be B (No).\n"
