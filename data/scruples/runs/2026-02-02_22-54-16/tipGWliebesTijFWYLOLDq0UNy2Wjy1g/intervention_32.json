She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 23. She's about to graduate with a master's degree but has never had a job. Her family is wealthy\u2014her dad is a dentist and her mom an accountant. They give her over $1,000 a month as an allowance. Now she wants to move in with him. He's okay with her paying half the rent and bills, which he does by himself now. When he asked how she plans to cover her half, she said her allowance will cover it and she'll expand her Instagram (8k followers) through affiliate marketing. The author is against that, telling her she needs a real job, to be an adult, and that with her parents' money and a minimum wage job, she could save instead of struggling. He also mentioned he doesn't want to cover the tab even though he's making $70k this year. He told her her friends' lack of real-world experience is the problem. She got upset, called him names, and felt like a bum.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the a**hole (AITA). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B). \n\nHmm, first, the key points here are the girlfriend's financial situation and the author's approach. The girlfriend has never worked, is relying on family allowance and plans to monetize her social media. The author is concerned about financial independence and responsibility, which is a valid point. But the way he communicated might be an issue. \n\nHe told her she needs to get a job and called her out for not working, which could come off as dismissive or not considering her aspirations. Using phrases like \"make money off IG from posts of her ass and tits\" might be disrespectful and undermine her efforts. Even if he's being honest, the tone could be harsh. His comment about her friends not being in the real world might also be hurtful, implying she's sheltered.\n\nOn the other hand, financial responsibility is important in a relationship, especially when moving in together. The author is setting boundaries that he's not going to cover her expenses, which is fair considering his own income. He's trying to be realistic about their future together and her ability to contribute. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? It's a balance between being supportive and being realistic. Maybe the author should have discussed this in a more supportive way, acknowledging her goals while expressing concerns. However, the core of his message is about financial responsibility, which is a legitimate issue. The harsh language might be the problem more than the message itself. \n\nSo, if the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's about the approach. The intentions might be good, but the delivery was hurtful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the way he communicated his concerns rather than the content. But I'm not sure if the content is entirely justified. She's about to have a master's degree but no work experience, and he's worried about their financial stability. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's right to care about financial practicality. I'm a bit conflicted here. The main issue is whether his criticism was valid or if he was being condescending. The fact that she's relying on family money is not inherently wrong, but the author's comment about her Instagram content being just \"pics of her ass and tits\" could be seen as belittling her choices. That might have been the trigger for her emotional response. So even if he's right about the financial aspect, the disrespectful comment about her content could make him the a**hole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
