She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to graduate with a master's degree but hasn't had a job before. Her parents are financially supporting her with an allowance. They want to move in together, and she plans to use her parents' money plus her Instagram affiliate marketing to cover her half of the rent and bills. The guy is upset and tells her she should get a job instead. She got upset and called him names.\n\nFirst, consider the context. He's moving out and wants her to be financially responsible. He's arguing that relying on Instagram and her parents' money isn't sustainable. She's coming from a family that's financially stable, so maybe she hasn't had to work a job. The guy is concerned about their financial future together. He's not wrong to want her to have her own income, but the way he communicated it might be an issue. He called her a \"bum\" and made negative comments about her Instagram content. That could be hurtful and dismissive of her efforts. \n\nBut on the other hand, he's trying to be realistic. If they move in and she doesn't have a stable income, there could be financial strain. Her relying on her parents might not be feasible long-term. He's also right that having a job could give her financial independence. However, the way he approached the conversation might have been harsh. Maybe he should have been more supportive of her affiliate marketing idea rather than dismissing it outright. \n\nThe key points are financial responsibility versus respect in communication. He's not necessarily wrong in wanting her to be productive, but the tone and content of his message could have been more constructive. She's transitioning into adulthood, and his approach might have been too confrontational. So, while his intentions are good, his execution might be where he's at fault. But I'm not sure if that makes him \"in the wrong.\" It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the answer is B because he's not wrong, but he could have handled it better. Alternatively, if the focus is on the communication style, then A. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the main issue is that he's not wrong in wanting her to be responsible, but he could have been more considerate. So the answer is B.\n"
