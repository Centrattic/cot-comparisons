She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's telling his girlfriend she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram affiliate marketing. She's finishing her master's and has never worked before. He's concerned that if she moves in with him, she'll struggle financially because her money from her parents and her Instagram might not be enough. He's suggesting she should get a real job, maybe even a minimum wage one, to be more independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, he's trying to set realistic expectations for their future together. Financial independence is important, especially in a relationship where they're planning to live together. He might be right that relying on her parents' allowance isn't sustainable long-term. Also, her Instagram income being based on posts might not be reliable, especially if it's just pictures, as he mentions. It's possible she's underestimating the challenges of making money online versus traditional work.\n\nOn the other hand, his approach might have been harsh. He called her out in a way that made her feel like a \"bum,\" which isn't very supportive. Relationships require communication and support, so criticizing her choices and friends without understanding her perspective could have caused hurt feelings. He might not have considered her feelings or the pressure of moving out and starting a new life together. Also, he's assuming she's not capable of making money through her Instagram, but maybe she has a different view or strategy. \n\nHe also mentioned expecting her to save money and be independent, but he's the one who's okay with her paying half the rent. Maybe he didn't consider that she's taking a big step by moving out, and she might need time to adjust. His tone seems to be more about practicality than empathy here. \n\nFinancial responsibility is important, but how he communicated his concerns might have been the issue. Instead of being confrontational, maybe a more supportive approach would have been better. He could have discussed his worries together and explored options, like part-time work while figuring things out, rather than making her feel criticized. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while his intentions might be good, the way he handled the situation could have been more considerate. He's not entirely wrong for wanting her to be independent, but his delivery and the judgmental comments might have been the problem. That makes me think the answer is A, because he might be in the wrong for how he expressed his concerns rather than the content itself.\n"
