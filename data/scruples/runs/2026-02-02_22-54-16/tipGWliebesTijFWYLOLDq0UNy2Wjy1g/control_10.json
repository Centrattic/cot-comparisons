She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a guy who's in a relationship with a girl who's about to finish her master's and has never had a job. She plans to move in with him and expects to cover half the rent with her parents' allowance and her Instagram affiliate marketing. The author thinks she should get a job instead, and he told her that, which upset her. She felt he was being harsh and making her feel like a bum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's trying to be responsible and realistic. He's concerned about their financial situation if she relies on her parents' allowance and maybe unreliable Instagram income. He's pointing out practical issues like not having enough money after rent and bills. He's also worried that she's not taking adult responsibilities seriously, especially since she has never worked. His intentions might be good, wanting her to be independent and for the relationship to be stable financially.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's perspective is that she might feel her plans are valid. She might be trying to build a career through affiliate marketing, which can be a legitimate income source, though it's uncertain. She might feel that her boyfriend is being dismissive and judgmental, especially with the comment about her posting pictures. That could come across as disrespectful, as it's not just her content but also the way he's framing it. She might feel that he's undermining her efforts and her self-worth, making her feel like she's not capable or that her aspirations are less valuable.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to question her financial plans? Was his approach respectful? Is it fair to pressure someone to get a job when they have different career goals? Also, the comment about her Instagram content might be the main issue here. Even if his intentions were good, the way he communicated it could have been hurtful. Calling her a \"bum\" or implying that her work isn't real might be condescending.\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters a lot. Even if he's right about the financial concerns, the way he expressed them could have been more supportive. Maybe he could have suggested alternative ways to combine her affiliate marketing with a part-time job, or discussed realistic expectations without belittling her current plans. The fact that he brought up her friends and their lifestyles might have made her feel judged for her background, which isn't fair. Everyone has different circumstances, and it's not her fault if her friends are also supported by their families.\n\nAnother angle is financial independence in relationships. The author wants her to contribute fairly, which is reasonable. But if she's not financially stable, it could create stress. However, he should also consider that transitioning from an academic environment to the workforce can be challenging, and she might need time to adjust. The author's comment about her parents' allowance and his own income might imply that she's not contributing as much as she should, which could be a point of contention.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns are valid and his desire for her to be responsible is understandable, the way he communicated his concerns\u2014especially the part about her Instagram content and calling her a bum\u2014might have been disrespectful and hurtful. It's possible that he's right about the financial practicality but wrong in his delivery, leading to the conflict. So, he might be in the wrong because of how he expressed his criticism rather than the criticism itself.\n"
