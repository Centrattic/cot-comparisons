She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this on AITA is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling his girlfriend she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's finishing her master's, never had a job, gets a $1k+ allowance from her parents (dentist and accountant). She wants to move in with him, saying her allowance will cover half the rent and bills, and she'll do affiliate marketing via Instagram. He's against that plan, telling her she should get a job. He argues that she needs to be productive, work, and not just depend on social media or her family. She gets upset, feels called out as a \"bum,\" and they argue.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is encouraging his girlfriend to be financially independent, which is a valid concern. It's important for a stable relationship that both partners contribute and are responsible with money. However, the way he approached the conversation might have been harsh. He criticized her current plan, mentioned her Instagram content in a derogatory way (\"pics of her ass and tits\"), and brought up her friends' situations. That could have been hurtful and disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, she's in a privileged position with her parents' support, but moving in together requires shared financial responsibility. The author is right in wanting her to take her finances seriously, but the delivery of his message might have been the issue. Instead of being supportive and discussing solutions together, he focused on her shortcomings and used potentially offensive language.\n\nAlso, financial expectations in relationships are important. It's reasonable for him to expect her to have a solid plan for contributing to living expenses. But the way he conveyed that\u2014calling her a bum and dismissing her Instagram plans as insufficient\u2014could have been more constructive.\n\nAnother angle: Her not having a job yet might be due to her educational path. She's just finishing her master's, so maybe she's in transition. The author might not have considered that she might be in the process of job hunting or planning her post-graduation steps. However, she does mention affiliate marketing as a plan, which he dismissed. He might not have given her enough credit for her own plans, even if they're not traditional.\n\nIn terms of the relationship, communication style matters. Even if the author's intentions are good, the method of communication affects the outcome. Insulting or belittling a partner, even if the concern is valid, can harm the relationship. So, the problem here could be the communication approach rather than the content of the message.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for bringing up the financial responsibility, but the way he did it was probably hurtful. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the harsh delivery and the insults, even if the concern is valid. However, some might argue that he's justified in wanting her to be responsible. But in the context of an argument about relationship responsibilities, the way he expressed his concerns likely contributed to the conflict.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author, while raising a valid concern about financial responsibility, expressed it in a way that was hurtful and dismissive. Calling his girlfriend a \"bum,\" making derogatory remarks about her Instagram content, and belittling her for not being in the \"real world\" were unkind and disrespectful. While encouraging her to take her financial future seriously is reasonable, the approach was unnecessarily harsh and contributed to the conflict. The key issue lies in the communication style rather than the concern itself.",
