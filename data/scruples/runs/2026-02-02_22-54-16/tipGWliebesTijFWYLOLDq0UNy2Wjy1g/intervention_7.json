She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy (M22) and his girlfriend (F23) are planning to move in together. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k+ monthly allowance. She wants to use that plus her Instagram affiliate marketing to cover her half of the rent and bills. The guy is against this, telling her she should get a job instead. He's concerned about her financial stability and that she might expect him to cover expenses if she relies on her current sources. She got upset, feeling insulted and called him names. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nLooking at the arguments: The guy is being realistic about financial responsibilities. He's concerned about her not having a stable income beyond an allowance and social media, which might not be reliable. He's advocating for her to become financially independent, which is a valid point. However, the way he expressed it might be harsh. Calling her a \"bum\" and commenting on her Instagram content (specifically mentioning her body) could be hurtful and dismissive of her efforts. The criticism of her friends and their lifestyles might also come off as judgmental.\n\nOn the other hand, her not having a job might make her unprepared for the financial responsibilities of an adult. The guy is trying to set expectations for their future together, which is reasonable. But the manner in which he communicated his concerns was probably too confrontational and lacking in support. The key here is whether the criticism was constructive or just harsh without empathy.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable because being told she's a \"bum\" and that her content is just \"pics of her ass and tits\" is not only degrading but also undermines her efforts. Even if she's not in a traditional job, she's trying to monetize her Instagram, which is a form of work, albeit unconventional. The guy's dismissal of her potential income source might be short-sighted. He's not wrong to want her to be financially responsible, but his approach was hurtful.\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters a lot. While the guy's intentions might be good\u2014wanting her to be independent and realistic about money\u2014his delivery was likely part of the problem. The question is whether the content of his message is justified despite the delivery. The girlfriend is in a transition phase, and his approach may have been more about control or lack of understanding of her situation rather than genuine concern.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's right to point out the financial risks. On the other, he handled it poorly. The answer might depend on the balance between the validity of his concerns and the way he expressed them. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that his tone and comments were harsh and disrespectful, even if his points have merit, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because of how he communicated his concerns. However, some might argue that the substance of his concerns is valid, making it a nuanced case. But in AITA contexts, the delivery often factors into whether someone is considered \"in the wrong.\"\n"
