Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new relationship where the boyfriend's nighttime behaviors are disturbing the author's sleep. The author is 23F, he's 26M. They've been dating a few weeks. The guy's actions include loud noises from his phone, scratching, burping, shaking the bed, etc. The author tried to communicate her needs but it didn't help. She ended up telling him she can't sleep with him again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a demanding schedule (work and coaching), so rest is important. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive despite her asking him to stop. She did tell him to turn off his phone, he complied but other issues continued. She felt pushed to her limit and decided to not sleep in the same bed. The next morning, she explained her reasons, and he was upset, but she feels justified because she's tired.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. The main issue is about shared living space and boundaries in a relationship. In a new relationship, especially when living together, communication is key. The author tried to address the problem by asking him to stop the phone, but the other actions (scratching, shaking the bed, etc.) weren't addressed until she threatened. The fact that she communicated her needs and he didn't adjust might indicate that he didn't respect her boundaries. However, the author's response was to stop sleeping with him, which could be seen as a reasonable step to protect her well-being, especially given her work schedule. \n\nBut is it in the wrong? If the boyfriend was unaware of his actions or couldn't control them, then the author's action is justified. However, if he was aware and continued despite her requests, then she's not wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of almost crying shows he felt hurt, but that doesn't make her wrong. She's prioritizing her health and needs, which is important. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, couples should work through such issues rather than separating. But given the circumstances\u2014his actions were persistent, her clear communication didn't help, and her need for rest is valid\u2014her decision seems reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
