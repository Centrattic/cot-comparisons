Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to sleep in the same bed as the boyfriend. The woman worked a long shift and was really tired. The boyfriend was making a lot of noise, shaking the bed, and she kept getting disturbed. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the rest of the night he still kept her up. She ended up pushing him away when he tried to cuddle, and in the morning she told him she can't do that again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman is clearly exhausted from her work and coaching. She needed rest, which is important for her well-being. The boyfriend was being disruptive with his actions\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, burping, etc. Even after she asked him to stop, he continued to disturb her. She even threatened to murder him if he did it again, which sounds like a sign of extreme frustration. The next day, she apologized but was clear about her needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt because she's pushing him away, especially after he apologized. He might feel rejected or not heard. But the key point here is that she communicated her needs. She tried to get him to stop, and when he didn't, she made her limits clear. Her health and well-being are important, and she has a right to set boundaries, especially when her schedule is packed. \n\nHer actions were about her need for sleep, which is valid. While it's possible that the boyfriend could work on being less disruptive, the fact that she's been clear about her needs and he's still causing issues might mean she's justified in her decision to sleep separately. The question is whether she's wrong for stating her needs. Since she communicated and tried to resolve the issue without being aggressive (except the threat, which is a bit strong), but overall, her actions are about self-care. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's prioritizing her well-being, and it's reasonable to set boundaries when someone's actions are affecting her health, especially in a short-term relationship where they might not have established long-term adjustments yet.\n"
