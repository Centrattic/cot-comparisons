Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation involves her being very tired after a long day, dealing with his disruptive behaviors during the night, and then setting a boundary by moving out of the bed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She worked 9 hours and coached soccer for 2 hours, so she's exhausted. Waking up multiple times because of noise and movement would definitely affect her rest. Her job schedule is described as \"crazy,\" which implies she needs her sleep to function properly. \n\nHer boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014are all things that can disturb a partner's sleep. She initially asked him to turn off his phone, and he did, but the disturbances continued. She tried to be polite, even apologizing when she said she might murder him. Her actions were to protect her own health and ability to manage her busy schedule. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, setting boundaries is important. If someone's behavior is affecting your well-being, it's reasonable to communicate that. However, the way she handled it might be a point of discussion. She did communicate her needs, albeit in a frustrated tone (using \"fucking\" and \"fuck man\"), but her main issue was the lack of sleep due to his actions. \n\nHer boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he was hurt, but that doesn't mean her needs are invalid. It's a balance between mutual respect and personal needs. Since she still loves him and explained her reasons, she's not being unreasonable. The key here is that she's prioritizing her health, which is crucial. \n\nIn many relationships, it's normal for partners to adjust their behavior if it's affecting the other. If he's truly considerate, he should respect her need for sleep. If he can't adjust, then her decision to not sleep in the same bed is a valid step to protect her own well-being. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her needs, which is a healthy part of a relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
