Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that she's with a new boyfriend, and during a night, he was making a lot of noise, shaking the bed, and keeping her up. She was exhausted from work and coaching. She told him to stop, he apologized, but he kept it up. She ended up threatening him in her sleep and then in the morning, she told him she can't sleep with him again but still loves him. He got emotional.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's main points: she's tired, worked hard, communicated her needs, and set a boundary. The boyfriend's actions: he was disruptive despite being asked to stop. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did communicate her discomfort and tried to address the issue. If he continued despite her requests, that's on him. However, the author's response was pretty direct\u2014threatening to murder him isn't ideal, but she clarified her needs in the morning. The boyfriend's emotional reaction might be due to feeling rejected, but that doesn't excuse his nighttime behavior. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if there's any fault on her side. Did she handle it poorly? Maybe the threat was harsh, but it was said in exasperation. Her main issue is needing sleep, which is valid, especially after a long day. Setting boundaries is healthy. The boyfriend's actions were the initial problem. So, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's nuance. Did she give him enough chances to adjust? She told him once, he tried to stop, but he kept it up. She might have needed to address it again if it continued. But in the end, she set a boundary, which is reasonable. So, B makes sense here.\n"
