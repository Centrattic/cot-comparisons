Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation involves the boyfriend's disruptive behavior during the night, leading the author to express her frustration.\n\nFirst, the author is a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a few weeks, and the sex is good, but the boyfriend's habits are affecting her sleep. She's exhausted from work and coaching, so she's particularly sensitive to disturbances. The boyfriend's actions include loud noises, scratching, burping, shaking the bed, and trying to cuddle too roughly. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up threatening him in the night and then in the morning, she told him she can't sleep in the same bed again because of her schedule and need for sleep. He was upset, but she felt justified.\n\nNow, considering the factors here. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author communicated her needs clearly, first by asking him to turn off the phone, then later stating her limits. The boyfriend, while apologetic, didn't manage to stop the disruptive behaviors despite being asked. The author's reaction stems from her need for rest, which is valid, especially given her demanding schedule. The boyfriend's actions were not malicious but were indeed causing her significant distress. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners consider each other's well-being. The author is prioritizing her health and ability to function, which is reasonable. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior or find a solution that accommodates both their needs. The fact that the author felt the need to set this boundary suggests that previous attempts to address the issue weren't effective. It's also worth noting that her schedule is very tight, so her need for sleep is critical.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's emotional reaction (almost crying) indicates he felt hurt, which is a natural response when someone sets a boundary. However, the author's actions were a response to ongoing issues that she had already tried to resolve. The question is whether her decision to sleep separately is justified. Since she communicated her needs and the situation wasn't improving, it seems reasonable for her to take that step. There's no indication she's being selfish; rather, she's addressing a legitimate problem that affects her daily functioning.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. She's setting a boundary to protect her health and well-being, which is essential in any relationship. The boyfriend may need to adapt or find a compromise, but the responsibility here isn't on the author for prioritizing her needs.\n"
