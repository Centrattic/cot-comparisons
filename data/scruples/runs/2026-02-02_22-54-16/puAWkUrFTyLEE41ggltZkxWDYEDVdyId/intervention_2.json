Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation described involves the boyfriend's behaviors during the night\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc.\u2014which caused the author to be disturbed and eventually push him off. She ends up telling him she can't sleep with him again, even though she still loves him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author is clearly exhausted from a long work and coaching schedule. The boyfriend's actions throughout the night repeatedly disturbed her sleep despite her initial request for him to turn off his phone. She communicated her needs, but the disturbances continued, leading to her frustration. Her final statement about not sleeping with him again is presented as a necessary decision for her well-being, even though it upset him.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). The main points to consider are communication, mutual respect, and shared needs. The author communicated her need for sleep and tried to address the issue. The boyfriend, while apologizing, didn't stop the behaviors that kept her awake. Sleep is crucial for health, and if one partner's habits are affecting the other's rest, it's reasonable for the affected partner to set boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he's hurt, but the author's priority is her health and schedule. \n\nIs it unfair for her to set this boundary? Probably not. Relationships require compromise, but one shouldn't have to sacrifice their health. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive, and her decision to prioritize her well-being isn't wrong. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like using separate beds temporarily or discussing solutions. But given the context, she's not in the wrong for stating her needs. So, answer B.\n"
