Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23F who's been dating a 26M for a few weeks. She's been working long hours and coaching, so she's exhausted. When they're in bed, he's making a lot of noise and disturbances, keeping her up all night. She tells him to turn off his phone, which he does, but then continues to shake the bed, scratch, burp, and cuddle too hard, making her push him off. Eventually, she tells him she can't do that again, even threatening to murder him if he wakes her again. She feels bad because he almost cries, but she's just really tired.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her need for rest due to her demanding schedule and his behavior that's preventing her from sleeping. Her job and coaching require a lot of energy, so getting enough sleep is crucial for her health and performance. His actions\u2014scratching, shaking the bed, loud noises\u2014are disruptive. She communicated her needs clearly, first by asking him to turn off the phone and then by setting a boundary about sleeping separately. He apologized but the behavior continued, leading to her frustration. \n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation here that might make her wrong? Maybe in some contexts, but generally, communication and mutual respect are key in relationships. She's being direct about her needs, which is healthy. He may need to adjust his behavior, but if he's unable to, then her decision to sleep separately is a reasonable step to protect her well-being. The fact that she still loves him and is apologetic shows she's not being vindictive, just prioritizing her health. \n\nHe's a new partner, so maybe there's room for growth and understanding. However, if the problem persists, her actions are justified. The answer here is probably B (she's not in the wrong) because she's clearly communicating her needs and taking steps to maintain her health, which is important.\n"
