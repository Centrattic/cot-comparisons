Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation is that after a long day, the boyfriend's nighttime habits (like loud noises, scratching, etc.) disturbed her sleep. She asked him to turn off his phone and tried to be polite, but he kept doing things that woke her up. She even threatened to murder him, then in the morning told him they can't sleep together again, which made him cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is a 23-year-old woman who's been in a new relationship. She's exhausted from work and coaching, so sleep is important. Her boyfriend's behavior is disruptive, and she's communicated her discomfort. The key issue here is about boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nWhen someone is having trouble sleeping because of a partner's actions, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos loudly, scratching, burping, shaking the bed\u2014these are all things that can interfere with sleep. The author tried to address it during the night, and he apologized and turned off his phone, but the disturbances continued. That suggests that just turning off the phone wasn't enough, and maybe the boyfriend wasn't fully aware of how disruptive his other behaviors were.\n\nShe eventually said she can't do that again, which is a clear boundary. Threatening to murder him is hyperbolic and probably said in frustration, but her main point in the morning was about needing sleep and their schedules. It's important to prioritize one's health and well-being, especially if the partner is being unreasonable or not respecting the request. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate that he's sensitive or felt rejected, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to set a boundary.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did communicate her needs, and if the boyfriend's actions persist despite that, she's justified in making a change. The boyfriend should be considerate of her schedule and tired state. While it's good that he apologized, if he can't adjust his behavior, the author is within her rights to prioritize her rest by sleeping separately.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's addressing a legitimate issue affecting her well-being, and setting a boundary is reasonable. The boyfriend needs to adapt or find a solution that respects her needs.\n"
