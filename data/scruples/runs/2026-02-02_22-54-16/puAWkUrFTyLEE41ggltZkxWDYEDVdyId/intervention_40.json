Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed.\n\nFirst, looking at the details: the author is a 23-year-old woman dating a 26-year-old man for a couple of weeks. They have good sex and the guy is described as sweet and a good guy. However, the last night in question was problematic. She was exhausted after a long day of work and coaching. Her boyfriend was disruptive in bed by watching videos, making loud noises, scratching, and shaking the bed. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up pushing him off when he cuddled too hard, and by morning, she told him she can't do that again because she needs sleep, leading to his emotional reaction.\n\nThe key points here are her need for rest due to her busy schedule and his inability to adjust his behavior. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, and I need to determine if that's accurate.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. She communicated her needs clearly, and he tried to apologize and adjust but didn't succeed. Her priorities (health and rest) are valid. While it's important to be considerate in a relationship, if someone's behavior consistently disrupts another's well-being, setting boundaries is necessary. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he felt hurt or rejected, but the author's health and schedule are legitimate concerns. There's no indication she was cruel; she even reassured her love. So, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her needs, especially in a new relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
