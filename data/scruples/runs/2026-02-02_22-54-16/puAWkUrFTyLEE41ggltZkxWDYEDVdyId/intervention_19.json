Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disrupted her sleep multiple times.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman is exhausted from a long work day and coaching. She's in bed trying to sleep, but her boyfriend is making a lot of noise and movements\u2014scratching, burping, shaking the bed. She asks him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the disturbances continue throughout the night. She ends up pushing him off when he cuddles too hard, and in the morning, she tells him she can't do that again because she needs sleep.\n\nHer reasons are clear: she's physically and mentally drained, her schedule is hectic, and her sleep is crucial. She communicated her needs and even apologized for the harsh comment about murdering him. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional (almost crying), but the author feels justified in prioritizing her rest.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The boyfriend might be unaware of how his actions affect her. He apologized after the initial request but didn't stop the other behaviors. The author is assertive about her needs, which is important in a healthy relationship. Sleep is a basic human need, and lack of sleep can affect overall well-being. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries, especially if repeated attempts to adjust haven't worked.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend is not intentionally disruptive, or maybe the author could have handled it differently, like using earplugs or a separate sleeping area earlier. But the key here is communication. She did talk to him, and he tried but didn't fully address the issue. Her decision to not sleep together temporarily is a boundary to protect her health. There's no indication she's being unreasonable or cruel without cause. She even acknowledges her love for him, showing it's about her needs, not him personally.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her well-being. Answer B.\n"
