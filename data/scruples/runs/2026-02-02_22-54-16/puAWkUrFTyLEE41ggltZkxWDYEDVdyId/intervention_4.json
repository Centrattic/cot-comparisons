Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship (couple of weeks) with a 26-year-old man. They have a good connection, good sex, but there's an issue about sleeping in the same bed. The problem arises when the boyfriend's nighttime behaviors are disrupting her sleep. She's worked a long day and is exhausted. He's watching videos on his phone, being loud, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, and trying to cuddle too hard, which keeps her awake. She tells him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the disturbances continue. She ends up threatening him in her sleep-deprived state and in the morning, tells him she can't do that again, even though she loves him. He got emotional, and she feels bad but also frustrated. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to sleep in the same bed.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship, communication, and the impact of one's actions on the other. The boyfriend's behaviors are clearly affecting her ability to rest, which is crucial for her well-being, especially after a long workday. The author communicated her needs, and when it didn't improve, she made a decision to prioritize her health. \n\nIn relationships, especially new ones, it's important that both partners consider each other's needs. If one partner's habits are causing significant distress, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries. The boyfriend's actions seem inconsiderate, but maybe he wasn't aware of the impact. However, after the first correction, he continued, which could indicate a lack of consideration. The author's response\u2014setting a boundary by not sleeping in the same bed\u2014is a way to protect her health. \n\nIs it wrong for her to prioritize her rest? Probably not. People need sleep, and chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) shows he might not have realized the severity, but that doesn't mean the author is at fault. She's not being cruel; she's setting a necessary boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, sleeping in separate beds temporarily or finding solutions to reduce disturbances. But the author's decision is about her well-being, and it's her right to do so. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her needs and took action when they weren't met. The boyfriend's behavior was problematic, and her response is understandable.\n"
