Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a 23-year-old woman) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation involves the boyfriend's disruptive behavior during the night. \n\nFirst, the context given is that the woman had a long, tiring day. She's exhausted and needs rest. The boyfriend's actions include loud noises, shaking the bed, scratching, burping, coughing, and trying to cuddle too roughly. These disturbances caused her to wake up multiple times. She told him to turn off his phone initially, which he did, but the other issues continued. In the morning, she told him she can't sleep with him again because of her schedule and need for sleep, even though she loves him. He was upset, but she's standing by her decision.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive and affected her well-being. She expressed her needs clearly, both during the night and the next morning. Her prioritizing her health and sleep is reasonable, especially given her work schedule. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he felt hurt, but his actions were objectively disturbing her rest. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is a healthy aspect of any relationship. There's no indication she was rude or unkind beyond stating her need. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that in a new relationship, such a decision is too abrupt, but given the circumstances, her needs are valid. Another angle is that couples should work through issues, but if the problem persists and causes significant distress, setting boundaries is appropriate. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her needs and took steps to protect her health, which is essential in any relationship.\n"
