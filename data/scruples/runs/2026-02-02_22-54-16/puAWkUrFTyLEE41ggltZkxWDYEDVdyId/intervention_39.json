Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who's been dating her boyfriend for a few weeks. She's exhausted from work and coaching, and when they're in bed, he's being disruptive with his phone, loud noises, and movements. She tells him to stop, he apologizes, but the disturbances continue. She ends up telling him to stop again in the morning, and he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points are that she was very tired, he was being loud and moving a lot, she asked him to stop and he tried but the behavior continued. She expressed her frustration, even joking about murder, but in the morning, she made it clear she needed sleep and that they couldn't keep doing this. The boyfriend was upset, but the author still felt it was necessary for her own well-being.\n\nFrom my perspective, the author is standing up for her needs. It's reasonable to ask a partner to be considerate during sleep, especially when one is tired. The boyfriend's actions disrupted her rest, and she communicated her boundaries. Even though he was hurt, her right to sleep shouldn't be compromised. The question is whether her response was justified. She didn't attack him or say something malicious, just expressed frustration and set a boundary. So, I think she's not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
