Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 23F, boyfriend is 26M. They've been dating a few weeks. She's been very tired after work and coaching. He was being disruptive with his phone, loud noises, scratching, etc. She tried to tell him to turn it off, he did, but kept waking her up all night. She pushed him off, and in the morning she told him she can't do that again. He almost cried, she feels bad but is justified because she's exhausted.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's at fault. I need to determine if her actions were appropriate. Well, she's clearly communicated her needs. She asked him to be quiet, he tried to follow but failed. She then set a boundary after multiple sleepless nights. Sleep is essential for her health, especially with her hectic schedule. It's reasonable to set a boundary that she needs her own space to rest. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he didn't realize the impact of his actions, but that doesn't mean she's wrong to prioritize her needs.\n\nAlso, relationships require communication and mutual respect. If he's causing her to not get enough sleep, it's a valid concern. She's not being cruel; she's stating her needs. The key here is that she's not rejecting him as a person but addressing a specific issue that affects her well-being. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
