Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman (23F) who told her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a night of disturbances. The boyfriend was loud, scratching, burping, etc., even after being asked to turn his phone off. She ended up being really tired and told him she couldn't do that again, leading to his emotional reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The main points here are about their living arrangement and mutual respect. They've been dating a few weeks, so it's a new relationship. She's working long hours and coaching, so sleep is crucial for her. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive, even after being asked to stop. She communicated her needs clearly, tried to be understanding but firm. \n\nThe boyfriend was sorry initially but didn't stop the disturbances. She felt compelled to set a boundary by not sleeping with him again. The key here is whether her actions were reasonable. She's prioritizing her health and well-being, which is important. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't mean her stance is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She expressed her discomfort and tried to resolve it. When that didn't work, she made a decision that's necessary for her to function. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior or find another sleeping arrangement. She's not in the wrong because she's standing up for her needs. The answer should be B (No).\n"
