Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep multiple times. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, good sex, but last night was an issue. She was exhausted after work and coaching, and her boyfriend was making a lot of noise and movements that kept her awake. She asked him to turn his phone off, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up threatening to murder him if he woke her again. In the morning, she told him she can't do that again because of her schedule and still loves him. He almost cried, and she feels bad but is tired.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nSo, considering the scenario, the author was in a situation where she needed rest, especially after a long day. The boyfriend's actions\u2014scratching, burping, coughing, shaking the bed\u2014were disruptive. She communicated her needs, and even after he tried to comply, the disturbances continued. She then set a boundary by telling him she can't sleep together again. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She tried to address the issue politely first, then escalated when the problem persisted. Her priority was her health and well-being, which is important. While the boyfriend was hurt, the author made it clear she still loves him. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he felt hurt, but the author's actions were about her own needs. \n\nIt's possible that the boyfriend might have felt rejected, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing her health. Shared sleeping can be challenging when there are differing needs. She's not wrong for setting a boundary to ensure her rest. So the answer is B.\n"
