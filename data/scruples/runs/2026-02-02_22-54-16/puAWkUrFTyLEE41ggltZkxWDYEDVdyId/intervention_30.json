Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, a 23-year-old woman, telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he's making too much noise and disturbing her sleep. She's been working long hours and coaching, leading to exhaustion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend was making loud noises\u2014talking to his phone, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. The author asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up being pushed awake multiple times and even threatened him, though she apologized in the morning. The boyfriend was upset, almost crying, which makes her feel bad.\n\nNow, determining if she's in the wrong. From a health and well-being perspective, getting enough sleep is crucial, especially after a long day. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues. The boyfriend's actions were affecting her ability to rest, which is a valid concern. She communicated her needs, but the problem persisted. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important, and it's her right to prioritize her health. However, the way she handled it\u2014threatening to murder him\u2014might be seen as harsh. But considering the context of her exhaustion, that outburst might be a result of stress and fatigue rather than malice.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior was disruptive. While he apologized after the initial request, he didn't address the ongoing issues. Maybe he could have been more considerate of her need for sleep. Relationships require mutual respect and adjustments. If the boyfriend is making consistent noises that affect his partner, he might need to change his habits or find alternative sleeping arrangements temporarily.\n\nThe author's decision to ask not to sleep in the same bed could be seen as a necessary step to prioritize her health. It's not uncommon for couples to sleep separately for various reasons. The boyfriend's emotional reaction suggests that he might not have anticipated the impact of his actions, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. She's setting a boundary to protect her well-being.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The key issue is the boyfriend's behavior affecting her sleep, and she has the right to address it. While communication could be improved, her actions are justified given the circumstances. So the answer should be B.\n"
