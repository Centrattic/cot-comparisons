Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the woman tells her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore because he disrupts her sleep with various noises and movements. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman is 23, her boyfriend is 26. They've been dating a few weeks. She's been working a long shift and coaching, so she's very tired. In bed, he's making a lot of noise and movement, which keeps her awake. She asks him to turn off his phone, and while he does, the other disruptions continue all night. She ends up being very frustrated and tells him she can't do that again, even though she loves him. He almost cries, but she feels justified because she's tired.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants confirmation. \n\nFrom a general perspective, people need rest and sleep is important. If someone's partner is disturbing their sleep consistently, it's reasonable to set boundaries. Communication is key in relationships, and she did communicate her needs, even if it was in a frustrated tone. However, they've only been dating a few weeks, so maybe there's still some adjustment period. But the boyfriend's behavior is objectively disruptive\u2014scratching, burping, moving a lot. That's not typical or respectful. \n\nShe didn't kick him out permanently, just said they can't sleep together again. That's a boundary she's setting for her own well-being. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't mean she's wrong. Sometimes people need space when they're not getting their basic needs met. \n\nI don't see any signs of her being unreasonable here. She's polite but firm in her request. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue. So the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
