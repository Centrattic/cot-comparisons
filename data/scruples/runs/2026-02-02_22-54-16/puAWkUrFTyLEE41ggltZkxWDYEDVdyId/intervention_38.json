Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep. She's a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. The situation: she's exhausted after work and soccer coaching, and he's making noises and moving around in bed, which keeps her awake. She tells him to turn off his phone, he apologizes, but the disturbances continue. She ends up threatening him in frustration and in the morning explains she can't do it again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's side is that her sleep is important, especially with her hectic schedule. She's worked a long day and needs rest. The boyfriend's side is that he was apologetic but still couldn't help the noises. Maybe he's not aware of how disruptive his actions are, or maybe he has some health issues causing the burping or coughing. \n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. She did tell him to turn off his phone, and he tried to cuddle her, which she found annoying. She made her needs clear in the morning, so she's not being inconsiderate. He cried, which might be his emotional reaction, but that doesn't mean she's wrong. Her need for sleep is valid, and she has the right to set boundaries. \n\nAlso, it's early in the relationship. She hasn't been sleeping with him before, so this might be the first time they're sharing a bed. It's reasonable for her to prioritize her health and schedule. The boyfriend should adjust his behavior to accommodate her needs, but if he can't, then she's justified in making a change. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She communicated her needs, and her health and sleep are important. The boyfriend should take responsibility for his actions and try to be more considerate. She's not being cruel; she's setting a boundary for her well-being.\n"
