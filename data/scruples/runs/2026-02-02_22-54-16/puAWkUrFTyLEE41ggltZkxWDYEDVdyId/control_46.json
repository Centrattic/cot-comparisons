Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (23F) telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a night of disruptions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a long day, 9-hour shift plus coaching soccer, so she was very tired. She asked him to turn off his phone initially, and he did, but then continued to make noises and movements that kept her awake. She tried to push him off when he cuddled too hard. In the morning, she told him she can't do that again, which made him cry, but she felt justified because she needed rest.\n\nNow, the key points are: the boyfriend's behavior (noises, bed shaking) affected her sleep, she communicated her needs, and she made a firm decision. The question is whether she's wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. She clearly expressed her discomfort multiple times. While he apologized and tried, his actions continued to disrupt her. Prioritizing her health and sleep is important, especially when her schedule is hectic. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries, even if it causes temporary hurt feelings. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) shows he's affected, but that doesn't mean she's wrong to prioritize her needs. \n\nAlternatives could be discussing sleeping in separate rooms or finding a compromise, but her decision here is about self-care. So, the answer is likely B (No), she's not in the wrong. She's maintaining her well-being and communicated her needs clearly.\n"
