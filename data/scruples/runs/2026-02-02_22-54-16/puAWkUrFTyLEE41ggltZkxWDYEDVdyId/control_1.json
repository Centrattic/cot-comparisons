Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. She's been very tired after work and soccer coaching, and he was making a lot of noise and disturbing her sleep. She told him to turn off his phone, and he did, but then continued to shake the bed, scratch, burp, etc., keeping her awake. She ended up threatening him and in the morning told him she can't do that again. He was upset, but she feels she's justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are about sleep disturbance and communication. She's exhausted and needs rest, which is important for her wellbeing. The boyfriend's behaviors were disruptive, even after being asked to stop. She set a boundary by telling him she can't continue like that, which is a valid action. However, threatening to murder him is extreme, but the context is stress and exhaustion. The question is whether she's wrong for standing up for her needs.\n\nOn one hand, she's right to prioritize her health. On the other, maybe she could have communicated better without the threat. But the threat was in a moment of frustration, and she apologized the next day. The boyfriend's actions were also problematic. It's about mutual respect and considering each other's needs. Since she's taking responsibility and the boyfriend's behavior was also an issue, she's not entirely in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
