Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the 23F) is in the wrong here. The situation is about her telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a long, tiring day\u20149 hours at work and 2 hours coaching soccer. She needs rest, which is understandable. The boyfriend's behavior: watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. Those things would definitely disrupt sleep. Even after she asked him to turn off his phone, he continued to be a disturbance with the bed shaking and loud noises. She tried to get him to cuddle, but he was too rough, making her push him off. The next morning, she told him she can't sleep with him again because she needs her sleep. He was upset, almost cried, but she still feels it's necessary because she's tired.\n\nSo, from her perspective, her health and well-being are important. She's communicated her needs clearly, and he didn't adjust his behavior even after being asked. The boyfriend's actions were the primary cause of the problem. He might be trying to be affectionate, but his actions were harmful to her rest. She's making a decision that prioritizes her health, which is a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend didn't realize the extent of his actions or was trying to be attentive but in a way that was counterproductive. However, the key point is communication. She did tell him, and he was sorry but didn't stop. So, she's within her rights to set boundaries. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault. She's communicating her needs and taking action to protect her well-being. The boyfriend should have respected her request and tried to be more considerate. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
