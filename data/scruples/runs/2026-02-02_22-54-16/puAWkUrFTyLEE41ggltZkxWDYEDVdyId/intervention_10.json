Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a few weeks, and the sex is good. The problem happened after a long day where she worked 9 hours and coached soccer for 2 hours. She was really tired and went to bed. Her boyfriend started watching videos on his phone, being loud, burping, scratching his body a lot, shaking the bed. She told him to turn it off, and he apologized and did. But all night, he kept disturbing her again. He tried to cuddle, which woke her up, and by 5 AM, she was so frustrated she said she'd murder him. In the morning, she told him she couldn't sleep in the same bed again because she needs her sleep, and he almost cried. She feels bad but justifies it because she's tired.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants opinions. The answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, let's consider the facts. She had a very long day, which is a valid reason for being exhausted. Her partner's actions (loud phone, burping, scratching, shaking the bed) were disruptive. She tried to communicate her needs by asking him to turn off the phone, but the disturbances continued. She was pushed to a point where she was on edge, leading to her harsh comment. The next morning, she communicated her need for better sleep, which is important for her well-being.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. She did communicate her discomfort, but it seems he didn't adjust his behavior enough. His crying in the morning might indicate he felt hurt by her words, which is understandable. However, she was clear about her need for sleep, which is a basic necessity. If sleeping in the same bed is causing her significant stress and sleep deprivation, it's reasonable for her to set a boundary, even in a new relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have approached the situation more gently. Her comment about murder was extreme, but it was said in frustration after a very long day. The next morning, she apologized and expressed her love, which shows she wasn't being malicious. Her priority was her health and well-being, which is valid.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not being unreasonable. She tried to address the issue, and when it didn't resolve, she set a boundary. Her actions were to protect her health. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). However, maybe there's a nuance where she could have discussed it with more empathy, but the core issue of needing sleep is justified. The boyfriend's behavior was problematic, and her response was a consequence of that.\n"
