Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman is 23, works a 9-hour shift and then coaches soccer for 2 hours. She's exhausted. Her boyfriend, 26, is being disruptive\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, burping, shaking the bed. She tells him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the noises continue through the night. She gets pushed awake multiple times when he cuddles. At 5 AM, she's so fed up she says she'd murder him if he wakes her again. The next day, she explains she can't do this again because of her schedule but still loves him. He's upset, almost cries, but she feels justified because she's tired.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't, but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me consider both sides. On her side: she's clearly overworked and needs rest. The boyfriend's behavior is very disruptive. She's communicated her needs, first by asking him to turn off the phone, then by being firm in the morning. She's honest about her schedule and her need for sleep. She's also showing that she still cares by mentioning she loves him.\n\nOn his side: he's trying to bond by cuddling, which is normal in a relationship. However, his actions are affecting her sleep, which is a basic need. He might feel rejected when she pushes him off, but he should have been more considerate of her need for rest. The fact that he apologized and turned off the phone initially suggests he tried to accommodate, but the repeated disturbances show he didn't fully respect her needs throughout the night.\n\nThe key here is communication and mutual respect. She communicated her needs, and he didn't follow through adequately. She's not being unreasonable by setting boundaries for her well-being. Even though he was upset, her health and ability to function are important. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her needs, especially when she's communicated clearly and still expressed her care for him.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
