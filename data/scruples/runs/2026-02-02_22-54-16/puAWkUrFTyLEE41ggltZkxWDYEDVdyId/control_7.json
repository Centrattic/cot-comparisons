Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman is 23, and they've been dating a few weeks. She worked a long day and was very tired. Her boyfriend was making a lot of noise and movements during the night, disturbing her sleep. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up pushing him off when he cuddled too hard. In the morning, she told him she can't sleep with him again because she needs her rest, even though she likes him. He got emotional, and she feels conflicted but is tired.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. She's clearly communicated her needs, both during the night and in the morning. He apologized but the behavior persisted. She's justified in needing her sleep, especially since her schedule is hectic. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive despite her requests. She's not being cruel; she's prioritizing her health and well-being. The fact that he almost cried shows he might be sensitive about it, but that doesn't negate her right to set boundaries. Relationships require compromise, and if he can't adjust his behavior, maybe sleeping separately is necessary. The author isn't in the wrong here. She's taking care of her needs, which is important in a healthy relationship.\n"
