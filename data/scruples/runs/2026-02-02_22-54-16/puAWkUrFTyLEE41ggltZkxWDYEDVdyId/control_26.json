Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he keeps waking her up with his behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman worked a long shift and coached, so she's exhausted. The boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014interrupt her sleep. She asked him to stop, he apologized, but it kept happening all night. She couldn't take it anymore and told him she can't do that again. He was upset, but she's prioritizing her need for sleep.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider common relationship dynamics. In relationships, especially early on, communication about needs is important. The woman explained her situation and the problem. She's not being unreasonable in needing sleep after a long day. The boyfriend's actions are disruptive, so it's not entirely her fault. She made her concerns known and tried to address it, but when it didn't work, she made a decision for her well-being. \n\nSome might argue she should have tried to find another solution, like using earplugs or a different sleeping arrangement without ending the shared bed. But given the circumstances, she's justified in setting a boundary. Her health and rest are important. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) is his issue, but that doesn't mean she was wrong to prioritize her needs.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
