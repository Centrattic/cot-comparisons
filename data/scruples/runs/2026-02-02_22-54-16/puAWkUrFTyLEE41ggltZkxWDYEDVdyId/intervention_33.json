Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new relationship where the author is exhausted from work and a soccer coaching session. She tells her boyfriend not to sleep in the same bed with her again because he's making too much noise and disrupting her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is described as sweet and good, but his actions\u2014watching videos, loud noises, shaking the bed\u2014clearly interfere with her rest. She tried to communicate her needs by asking him to turn off his phone, but the disruptions continued, leading to her frustration and a threat. In the morning, she apologized but stood by her decision because she needs sleep for her busy schedule.\n\nThe author's main point is to get rest, which is essential for her health and job. She communicated her needs, and when they weren't met, she took action. He was upset, but she felt it was necessary. \n\nI should consider norms in relationships. Early in a relationship, boundaries are important. If one partner's behavior is affecting the other's well-being, it's reasonable to set boundaries. While it's a new relationship, sleep issues can be a significant problem. She didn't force him out; she just asked not to share the bed anymore, which is a personal choice. \n\nHe might feel rejected, but the author's health and work schedule are valid concerns. It's not about being inconsiderate but about prioritizing self-care. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary for her own well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
