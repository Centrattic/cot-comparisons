Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new relationship where the boyfriend's nighttime behaviors are disturbing the author's sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a couple of weeks, and while the sex is good, the boyfriend's actions during the night are causing her to lose sleep. She's exhausted from work and soccer coaching. She tells him to be quiet, and he apologizes and turns off his phone, but he continues to be disruptive through the night. She ends up threatening him in her sleep-deprived state and in the morning, she tells him she can't continue like this, even though she loves him. He's upset, but she feels justified because she's tired.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider if she's justified in her actions. Sleep is essential, and if someone's actions are preventing a partner from getting rest, that's a valid concern. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014scratching, burping, shaking the bed\u2014sounds disruptive. Even if he's trying to cuddle, if it's waking her up, it's a problem. However, since the relationship is new, there might be an expectation of compromise and communication.\n\nBut the author did communicate her needs. She asked him to turn off his phone and then later had to confront him again. Her reaction of being tired and needing space isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend's emotional response might indicate he's not used to conflict, but that doesn't make her wrong. She's prioritizing her health and well-being, which is important. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have found a middle ground, like sleeping in separate beds temporarily until they can adjust. But given her exhaustion, she might not have the energy for that. Also, setting boundaries is healthy in a relationship. If he's not respecting her need for sleep, that's a red flag for him, not her.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. Her actions are about self-care and maintaining her health, which is a valid priority. The boyfriend needs to adjust his behavior or find a solution that works for both. She's communicated clearly and given reasons for her stance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
