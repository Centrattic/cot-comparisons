Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. She's really tired after work and coaching, and he starts doing all these things that disturb her sleep. She asks him to stop, he apologizes but keeps doing it all night. She gets frustrated, threatens him in the morning, but still tells him she loves him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The woman worked a long shift and coached, so she's exhausted and needs rest. Her partner's behavior\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014is disruptive. Even after she asks him to stop, he doesn't change his behavior, leading to her being pushed to her limit. She communicates her needs, even if it's harshly, and feels bad about it but justifies it because she's tired.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy is in a new relationship, maybe not used to the dynamics of sharing a bed. He might not realize how his actions are affecting her. He apologizes when asked, so maybe he's not intentionally being a jerk, but his behavior continues. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The woman is setting boundaries, which is important, especially when her health and well-being are at stake.\n\nIn relationships, it's about finding a balance. Both partners should consider each other's needs. The woman's need for sleep is crucial, especially with her busy schedule. The guy's actions, while perhaps unintentional, are impacting her significantly. She's trying to address it, but he's not adjusting. Her response, while perhaps harsh, is a result of being pushed beyond her limit. She does express her feelings and love afterward, showing she's not being malicious.\n\nI think the main issue here is the guy not respecting her need for rest after she's communicated it. The woman is justified in setting those boundaries. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
