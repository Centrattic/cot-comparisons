Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the woman (23F) telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore after a bad night's sleep due to his behaviors.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The woman worked a long shift, coached soccer, and was exhausted. She asked him to turn off his phone because he was being loud, which he did, but he continued to disturb her with scratching, burping, shaking the bed, etc. She tried to push him off when he cuddled too hard, and eventually had to tell him she can't do that again. She feels bad but also needs rest.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: he was loud, scratched a lot, burped, and shook the bed. Even after apologizing, the disturbances continued. The woman's response was to set a boundary by not sleeping in the same bed. The question is whether she's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships: In a relationship, both partners should respect each other's needs. The woman had a legitimate reason for needing rest due to her demanding schedule. The boyfriend's behavior disrupted her sleep despite her request. Setting a boundary to protect her health and well-being is reasonable. Relationships require compromise, but if one person's actions repeatedly harm the other's well-being, it's understandable to set limits.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected, but his actions were objectively disruptive. The woman communicated her needs clearly, and the boyfriend didn't adjust after being asked. So, the woman isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and sleep. The answer is B (No).\n"
