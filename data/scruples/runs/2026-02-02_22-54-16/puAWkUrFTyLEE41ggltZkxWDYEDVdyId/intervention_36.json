Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person writing the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman worked a long day, was exhausted, and needed rest. Her boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos loudly, making noise, shaking the bed\u2014were disruptive. She asked him to stop, he tried to comply, but the disturbances continued. She ended up threatening him and then told him she can't do that again. He was upset, but she felt justified because her sleep is important for her schedule.\n\nShe's asking if she's in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't, but wants my opinion. The key points here are consent and mutual respect in a relationship. If someone's actions are affecting another's well-being, the affected person has the right to set boundaries. Sleep is crucial, especially after a long day, so her need for rest is valid. The boyfriend's behavior, while maybe not intentional, was indeed interfering with her health and happiness. \n\nHowever, communication is key. She did communicate her needs, and when he didn't stop, she took action. The threat of \"murder\" is hyperbolic but shows her frustration. She apologized the next day, showing she still cares. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he felt hurt, but the root issue is his behavior affecting her. \n\nIn relationships, partners should respect each other's needs. If one partner's habits are causing consistent problems, it's reasonable to address them. Since she's setting a boundary to protect her health, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend needs to adjust his behavior or find a solution that works for both. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
