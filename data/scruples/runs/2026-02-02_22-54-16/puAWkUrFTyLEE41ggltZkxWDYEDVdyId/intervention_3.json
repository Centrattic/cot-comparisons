Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the woman not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend because of his behaviors at night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman is 23 and has been dating the guy for a few weeks. She's been working a lot, and last night was really exhausting. The boyfriend was making a lot of noise and movements during the night, which kept her awake. She told him to stop, and he did, but still couldn't sleep. Eventually, she threatened him and in the morning told him she can't do this again, even though she loves him. He was upset.\n\nThe key points here are her need for rest due to her busy schedule, the boyfriend's disruptive behavior, and her reaction to it. The question is whether she was wrong to set this boundary. \n\nI think the woman isn't in the wrong. She's communicated her needs, and if he's affecting her health and well-being, it's reasonable to ask for space. Her schedule is mentioned as crazy, so sleep is important. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive despite her requests, so her decision to not sleep together is a valid boundary. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like using separate rooms or beds temporarily. But given the circumstances, she's justified in her stance. So the answer is B.\n"
