Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman is a 23-year-old with a demanding schedule (9-hour shift and soccer coaching), which left her very tired. Her boyfriend, a 26-year-old, was loud on his phone, made noises like burping and scratching, shook the bed, and tried cuddling too much, making her push him off. She told him to stop, and he apologized but didn't change his behavior. The next morning, she told him she can't sleep with him again because she needs her sleep, even though she loves him. He was upset, but she felt justified.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In a relationship, mutual respect and consideration for each other's needs are important. She's clearly exhausted and has valid reasons for needing rest. Her boyfriend's actions were disruptive, and despite her initial request, he continued, leading to her frustration. She communicated her needs and set a boundary, which is healthy. He was hurt, but his actions were the root cause here.\n\nPossible arguments for her being wrong (A): Maybe she should have been more patient or found another way to handle it, like sleeping separately earlier. However, she did communicate her request, and he didn't adjust. Also, taking care of her health and well-being is crucial.\n\nArguments against (B): She's justified in prioritizing her rest. Relationships require compromise, but if one person's habits are harming the other's health, boundaries are necessary. His reaction is sad, but her actions stem from a need to take care of herself.\n\nI think the key here is that she had a legitimate reason (being overworked and needing sleep) and he failed to respect her initial request. Setting a boundary to protect her well-being is reasonable. So she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
