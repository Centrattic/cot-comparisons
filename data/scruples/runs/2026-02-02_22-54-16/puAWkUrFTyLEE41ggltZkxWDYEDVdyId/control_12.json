He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through it again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship (a few weeks) with a 26-year-old man. She worked a long shift and then coached soccer, so she's really tired. When they're in bed, he starts watching videos on his phone, making loud noises, burping loudly, scratching himself a lot, shaking the bed. She asks him to turn it off, and he does. But all night she keeps waking up due to his actions. He tries to cuddle, which wakes her up more, and she pushes him off. At 5 am, she threatens to murder him if he does it again. In the morning, she apologizes and says she can't sleep in the same bed again because of her schedule, but still loves him. He gets almost emotional, and she feels bad but is still tired.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, she's in a new relationship. They've been dating a couple of weeks, so maybe things are still being negotiated. She's had a very long day, 9 hours work plus 2 hours coaching. It's reasonable that she needs rest. The boyfriend's behavior is disruptive: loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed. Even after she asked him to stop, he continued, leading to multiple interruptions. He also tried to cuddle, which she found too forceful. \n\nHer response at 5 am was a bit harsh, threatening murder, but in the morning she apologized and explained her need for sleep. The boyfriend's reaction was emotional, which might indicate he felt hurt or misunderstood. However, the author's primary concern is her own well-being and health. \n\nFrom her perspective, she's been clear (told him to turn off the phone, then again in the morning) and he was apologetic. The problem seems to stem from his habits that she finds disruptive. The key here is that she's prioritizing her need for sleep, which is important for her health and job. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend felt rejected when she pushed him off and didn't cuddle. He might have been trying to be affectionate, but she's in a different space. The question is whether she's overreacting or just setting necessary boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did communicate her needs, and he tried to adjust but maybe didn't fully address the issue. Her decision to not sleep in the same bed could be a personal boundary, especially if he has habits that affect her sleep. Sleep is a basic need, and if his actions prevent her from getting rest, even after being asked, she's justified in setting that boundary. \n\nBut is it fair to expect him to change his habits? Maybe he's not aware of how loud he is when he's asleep. However, she specifically asked him before going to bed, so if he was still doing those things after that, he might need to be more considerate. \n\nThe author's threat was extreme, but it was in a moment of frustration. In the morning, she's apologetic and explains her reasons. So her actions were a reaction to being sleep-deprived. \n\nIs there any cultural expectation here? Maybe, but the story is from the West, and in many modern relationships, partners try to accommodate each other's needs. However, this is a new relationship, and sometimes it takes time to adjust to each other's quirks. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of crying might show he felt hurt, but the author's health and work are also important. If he can't adjust his behavior, maybe the author is right to set a boundary. \n\nSo the options are A (she's in the wrong) or B (she's not). The story is about whether she's an a**hole for setting this boundary. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive, she communicated her needs, and he didn't fully comply. Her response was to move out of the same bed, which is a personal choice. Therefore, I think she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
