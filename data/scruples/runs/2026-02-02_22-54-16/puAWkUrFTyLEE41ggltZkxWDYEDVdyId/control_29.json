Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the woman not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend after a rough night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman (23F) and her boyfriend (26M) have been dating a few weeks. She's worked hard that day, and he kept disturbing her sleep with his phone, noise, etc. She asked him to stop, he apologized, but it kept happening. She threatened to murder him if it happened again. Now she's telling him she can't sleep with him again because she needs rest, despite loving him. He's upset, but she feels justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. She tried to communicate her needs, but he kept disrupting her. She's prioritizing her health and work schedule. He's a good guy, but maybe not aware of his habits. Is it fair for her to set this boundary? Well, she's under stress, and sleep is important. If he's not respecting her needs after being told, maybe she's right to set a boundary. But maybe she could have handled it differently? However, she did apologize and said she loves him. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she's being too harsh, but considering the circumstances\u2014she's working a lot, he's not respecting her rest. It's a new relationship, so maybe she's right to prioritize her well-being. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but she's not wrong for needing space. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). People have different needs, and she's clear about hers. He needs to adjust, but if he's not, she's within her rights to take action. The key is mutual respect. She's being honest and taking responsibility by explaining she still loves him.\n"
