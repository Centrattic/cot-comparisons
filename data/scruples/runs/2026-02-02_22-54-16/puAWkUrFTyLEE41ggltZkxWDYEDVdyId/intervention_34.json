Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong when they told their boyfriend they didn't want to sleep in the same bed. The scenario involves the boyfriend's behavior during the night\u2014watching videos loudly, making noises, moving around, which disturbed the author's sleep. She eventually tells him she can't handle it anymore and that she might kill him if he does it again. The next day, she apologizes but still sets boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is exhausted from work and coaching, needing rest. Sleep is crucial, especially when someone has a demanding schedule. The boyfriend's actions\u2014noises, movements, and not respecting her need for sleep\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that she tried to communicate her needs and he apologized but didn't change his behavior all night might indicate a pattern that's hard to address immediately.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might not have realized how disruptive his actions were, especially since it's only been a couple of weeks into the relationship. He apologized, which shows he's trying, but maybe he's still learning about shared sleeping habits. His emotional reaction (almost crying) suggests he felt hurt by her harsh words, which might indicate that communication could be improved.\n\nHowever, the author's main issue is her right to a good night's sleep. Sleep is a basic need, and if a partner's behavior is consistently interfering, setting boundaries is reasonable. The author did communicate her needs, and when they weren't met, she took action to protect her well-being. The threat of murder was an exaggeration, but it underscores her frustration. Her apology in the morning shows she's still considerate of his feelings, but firm in her needs.\n\nIn relationships, especially new ones, differences in sleeping habits can cause friction. It's not necessarily about who's right or wrong, but about mutual respect and finding solutions. The key here is that the author is prioritizing her health and well-being, which is valid. The boyfriend's actions, while perhaps unintentional, were disruptive. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries when necessary. So the answer should be B.\n"
