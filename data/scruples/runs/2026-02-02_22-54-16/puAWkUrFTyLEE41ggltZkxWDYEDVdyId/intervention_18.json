Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The key points are that the author (23F) is tired from a long day, her boyfriend (26M) is being disruptive in bed, and she ends up telling him she can't sleep in the same bed anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She had a 9-hour shift and coached soccer, so she's exhausted. The boyfriend's actions\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014are interrupting her sleep. She asked him to turn off his phone, but the disturbances continued. She got so fed up that she threatened him, then in the morning told him she can't do that again.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she's clearly communicating her needs. Sleep is important, especially when someone is overworked. The boyfriend's behavior is disruptive and he apologized but didn't stop. The author's response is about self-care and setting boundaries. Even though she felt bad, her actions were to protect her health. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he might not have realized the impact of his actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
