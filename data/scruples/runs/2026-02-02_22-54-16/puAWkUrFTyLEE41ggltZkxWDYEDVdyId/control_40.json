Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he's keeping her up. She worked a long day and is exhausted. He's being loud with his phone, scratching, burping, etc., and she's trying to sleep. She tells him off, and in the morning, she says she can't do that again. He's upset, but she feels she needs her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: she's tired, has a demanding schedule, and her partner's behaviors are disrupting her rest. She communicated her needs and set a boundary. That seems reasonable because sleep is important for health and well-being. She also mentioned she still loves him and didn't mean to hurt his feelings, but her needs come first.\n\nOn the boyfriend's side, he might feel rejected or that his partner isn't being considerate. But he was the one doing things that disturbed her. He apologized and tried to change, but the problem persisted. Maybe he has his own issues, like stress or habits he's not aware of. However, the fact that she had to set this boundary because he couldn't adjust shows that he might not be fully considering her needs.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author clearly communicated her needs and tried to be kind. She's not the one causing the disturbance. Her actions are about self-care and maintaining her health. While it's hard to see someone get upset, the situation doesn't seem to indicate she's being unreasonable. If he's unable to adapt to her needs, maybe they need to find another solution, like different sleeping arrangements temporarily. But in this specific instance, she's acting in her own well-being, which is valid.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in prioritizing her rest, especially given her work schedule and the fact that her partner's actions were disruptive despite his attempts to change. It's about mutual respect and understanding, and she's taking a stand for her needs without being unnecessarily harsh. The boyfriend's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's actions are understandable and justified.\n"
