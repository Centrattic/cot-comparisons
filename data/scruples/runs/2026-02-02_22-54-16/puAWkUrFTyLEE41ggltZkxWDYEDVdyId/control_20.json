Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who are dating for a few weeks. The woman (23F) is telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he's making a lot of noise and disturbing her sleep. She's worked a long day and is exhausted. The boyfriend apologizes but she ends up being very frustrated, even threatening to murder him if he wakes her again. In the morning, she tells him she can't do that again but still loves him. He's upset, she feels bad but also just wants to sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she's in the wrong. The key points here are whether her actions are justified. She's had a long day, worked 9 hours, coached for 2 hours, and is clearly very tired. Her boyfriend's behavior\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014has disrupted her sleep. Even after he apologizes, the disturbances continue. She tells him to turn off his phone, but he can't help the physical things like scratching and loud sounds. \n\nShe's honest with him the next day about needing her sleep and can't do that again. The boyfriend is hurt, but she's prioritizing her well-being. In relationships, communication is key. She communicated her needs clearly. It's not like she's being unreasonable; she's exhausted and needs rest. While it's early in the relationship, she's setting boundaries, which is important. \n\nIs there a wrong here? Maybe not. She's not being cruel; she's explaining her needs. He might feel rejected, but she's not saying she doesn't love him. The question is whether she's in the wrong for setting that boundary. From a common-sense perspective, it's reasonable to prioritize sleep, especially after a long day. So probably the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to adjust his habits for co-sleeping, but she's within her rights to state her needs.\n"
