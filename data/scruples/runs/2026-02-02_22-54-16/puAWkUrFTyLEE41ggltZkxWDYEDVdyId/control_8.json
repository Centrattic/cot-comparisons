Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he kept disturbing her sleep with his noises and movements.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The woman worked a long day and was exhausted. Her boyfriend was making a lot of noise and physical disturbances, which kept her awake all night. She asked him to stop, and even though he apologized and turned off his phone, the disturbances continued. She then tells him she can't do that again and loves him, but he's upset. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's explaining her need for rest due to her busy schedule. Her actions were to set a boundary to protect her health and well-being. She communicated her feelings respectfully, even though she was frustrated. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive and, despite an initial apology, didn't change. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of almost crying might indicate that he felt hurt or rejected, but that doesn't necessarily mean her decision was wrong. It's about mutual respect and boundaries. If the boyfriend was aware of her tiredness and still couldn't manage his behavior, he might be at fault for not accommodating her needs. However, the woman is asserting her needs, which is a healthy relationship dynamic.\n\nSo, the key points are: her right to rest, communication of her needs, and the boyfriend's responsibility to respect that. Since she's not being unreasonable and is being clear, the answer is likely B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
