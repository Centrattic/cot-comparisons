Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who's been dating her boyfriend for a few weeks and decides she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore due to his nighttime habits.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman is exhausted from work and coaching, and her boyfriend is making a lot of noise and movements during the night. She tells him to turn off his phone, which he does, but he still ends up disturbing her sleep with scratching, burping, etc. She ends up pushing him off when he tries to cuddle and even threatens him with a murder joke. In the morning, she tells him she can't do that again and he gets emotional, but she feels justified because she's tired.\n\nNow, considering the key points: communication and mutual respect. She addressed the issue directly by telling him to turn off his phone and later informed him she needed her space. Her actions were a response to repeated disturbances despite her initial request. The boyfriend's behavior seems to be the root problem here\u2014he was causing disruptions even after being asked. However, she did push him off and made a threat, which might come off as harsh, but given the context of her exhaustion, it's understandable. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From what I see, she's communicating her needs clearly and taking steps to prioritize her health. While the threats might be a bit strong, the main issue is his behavior. She's justified in setting boundaries, especially since they've only been dating a couple of weeks. So, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
