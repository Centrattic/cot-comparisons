Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (23F) broke up with her boyfriend (26M) after one night where he was disruptive while they were sleeping. She was exhausted from work and coaching, and he was making a lot of noise and moving around, which kept her awake. She told him to turn off his phone initially, but he kept disturbing her throughout the night. She threatened him in the morning and then broke up with him because she needed her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a valid reason for needing rest after a long day. Her job and coaching schedule are demanding, so getting enough sleep is important for her well-being. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might not have been aware of how his actions were affecting her. He apologized when she asked him to turn off the phone, but his other behaviors (scratching, burping, shaking the bed) continued. These are more about his personal habits that are hard to control, but they clearly disturbed her sleep.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author did communicate her need for rest by asking him to turn off the phone and later setting a boundary by threatening to \"murder\" him if he kept waking her. This was probably a last straw after being sleep-deprived. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) suggests he felt hurt by her decision, which is understandable because she ended the relationship over this one incident. However, the author's main concern was her health and ability to function due to lack of sleep, which is a legitimate issue.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues that affect one's quality of life. If the boyfriend was unaware of his habits and didn't change them despite being asked, that's on him. The author's decision to prioritize her needs might seem harsh, but it's about self-care. However, breaking up over one night might be a strong reaction. Maybe there was a pattern of behavior that wasn't addressed, but the story only mentions this single incident. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might not have been trying to be disruptive on purpose. His scratching and movements could be involuntary or due to stress. But the author has the right to her own space and rest. If sharing a bed was causing her significant distress, then it's reasonable for her to set that boundary. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs and took action to protect her health. The boyfriend might need to work on his habits if he wants to maintain a relationship where shared sleeping is possible. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
