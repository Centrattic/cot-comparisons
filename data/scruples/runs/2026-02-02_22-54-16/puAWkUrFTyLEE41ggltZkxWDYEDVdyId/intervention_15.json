Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation is that the boyfriend was being disruptive all night\u2014watching videos, making loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed. The author was exhausted after a long day and kept waking up. She finally told him she would murder him if he did it again, and in the morning she said she can't do that again but still loves him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason for needing rest, especially after a 9-hour shift and 2 hours of soccer coaching. Sleep is important for her well-being. The boyfriend's actions were clearly disturbing her rest\u2014loud noises, physical movements. He apologized and turned off his phone initially, but the problem continued throughout the night. \n\nThe author's response was to set a boundary by telling him she can't sleep in the same bed anymore. Even though she feels bad, her health and schedule are important. The boyfriend almost cried, which might indicate he was taken aback, but that doesn't negate her need for sleep. \n\nIs it unreasonable for her to ask to sleep separately? In relationships, it's common for partners to have different needs. If one partner is disrupting the other's sleep, especially when they've already tried to communicate and the behavior continues, it's reasonable to seek a solution. Sleeping in separate beds can be a temporary or long-term fix for such issues. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author communicated her needs and the boyfriend didn't adjust his behavior despite the initial apology. The author is prioritizing her health, which is a valid concern. So, she's not in the wrong for setting that boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
