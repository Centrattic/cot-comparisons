Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. So first, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe woman is 23 and has been dating a 26-year-old guy for a few weeks. Their relationship is going well, and sex is good. But last night, after a long day of work and soccer coaching, she was really tired and wanted to sleep. The boyfriend was making a lot of noise with his phone, burping loudly, scratching his body, and shaking the bed. She asked him to turn off his phone, and he did, but during the night he kept waking her up again and again with the same behaviors. Finally, she threatened to murder him if it happened again, and in the morning, she told him she can't do that again because her schedule is crazy and she needs sleep, even though she still loves him. The boyfriend almost cried, and she feels bad but also justified because she's tired.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nNow, considering the situation. The key points here are about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The woman clearly communicated her need to sleep, and despite the initial apology, the boyfriend's actions continued to disrupt her rest. She had a right to express her discomfort and set boundaries, especially after working a long shift. Her reaction in the morning\u2014being honest about her schedule and needing sleep\u2014seems reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior that night was inconsiderate, so she's not wrong for addressing it. The fact that he almost cried might indicate he's sensitive, but that doesn't mean her actions were inconsiderate. She's prioritizing her health and well-being, which is important. \n\nPossible arguments against her: Maybe she should have been more patient or discussed it earlier. But given that it was a one-time incident and she communicated her feelings the next day, that's unlikely. The boyfriend's actions were excessive and clearly disturbing her rest, so she's justified. \n\nSo the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
