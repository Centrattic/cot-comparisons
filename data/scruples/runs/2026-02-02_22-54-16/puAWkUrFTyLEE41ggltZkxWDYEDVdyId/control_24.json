Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman (23F) who's dating a guy (26M) for a couple of weeks. She's been working a lot and needs her sleep. Last night, her boyfriend was being disruptive in bed with his phone, loud noises, etc., and she ended up telling him she can't sleep with him anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details. She's been working 9 hours and coaching 2 hours, so she's very tired. The boyfriend was being noisy and disruptive, even after she asked him to turn off his phone. He apologized but continued to disturb her sleep. She tried to push him off when he cuddled too hard. Then she told him she can't do that again and that she needs sleep, even though she loves him. He got upset, and she feels bad but also frustrated.\n\nNow, from a general perspective, the key points are: her need for rest is valid, especially after a long day. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014sounds disruptive. She did ask him to stop, and while he apologized, he didn't stop the shaking and other noises. Her reaction was to set a boundary, which is her right. She communicated her needs, which is important in a relationship. However, she did say she'd murder him if he woke her again, which is extreme and maybe a bit harsh. But given her exhaustion, that might be an emotional response. \n\nThe boyfriend crying might show he felt rejected or hurt, but maybe he should have been more considerate of her needs. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If he was aware of her tiredness and still couldn't adjust his behavior, even after being asked, she's justified in setting boundaries. Also, she's in a new relationship, and communication about sleep needs is important. So, in this scenario, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were problematic, and she's asserting her needs. So answer B.\n"
