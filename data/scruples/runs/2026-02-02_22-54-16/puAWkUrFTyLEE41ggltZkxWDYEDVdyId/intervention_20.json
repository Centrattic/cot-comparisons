Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating a few weeks, and the sex is good. The problem arises when she's exhausted after a long day and can't sleep because of his behaviors.\n\nFirst, she's worked a 9-hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours. That's a lot of physical and mental exertion. She's in bed trying to sleep, but he's being disruptive: watching videos aloud, making loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed. She asks him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the disturbances continue. She's waking up multiple times, leading her to tell him she can't cuddle anymore, and even threatens to murder him if he wakes her again. The next morning, she explains her need for sleep but reassures him she loves him. He gets emotional, but she feels it's necessary.\n\nI need to determine if she's in the wrong. Her actions are about her well-being. She communicated her needs, and when he didn't adjust, she set boundaries. It's reasonable to prioritize sleep, especially when she's working hard. However, the way she reacted (threatening to murder him) might be a bit harsh, but in the moment of frustration, it's understandable. The key here is whether her actions were justified given the circumstances. Since she tried to resolve it politely and he didn't comply, her firm response isn't unreasonable. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration, and she's asserting her needs. He should also be considerate, but the question is about her being in the wrong. Her communication was direct, and setting boundaries isn't the issue. The answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
