Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that she's been dating her boyfriend for a few weeks, and they have a good relationship with good sex. But last night, she was really tired after work and coaching, and he was making a lot of noise and was physically disturbing her sleep. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but he kept shaking the bed, scratching loudly, burping, and cuddling too hard, keeping her awake all night. She ended up telling him she can't do that again because she needs sleep, even though she loves him. He was upset, but she felt justified because she was exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The key points here are her need for sleep due to her busy schedule and his behaviors that disrupted her. In a relationship, both partners should consider each other's needs. She was clear about her request to turn off the phone, which he did, but the other issues like scratching and bed shaking continued. Maybe he didn't realize how disruptive his actions were. However, after being told about the phone, he might not have known that the other actions were also a problem. On the other hand, she felt the need to set a boundary that she can't sleep in the same bed anymore. \n\nIs she wrong for setting that boundary? Well, she's prioritizing her health and well-being, which is important. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect her work and coaching performance. If the relationship is new, maybe they need to adjust their sleeping arrangements temporarily. But is there a way to resolve this without moving to separate beds? Maybe he could work on his habits, like maybe using a different room or adjusting his movements. However, she did mention that he was \"very sweet and a good guy,\" but perhaps they're both still learning each other's boundaries. \n\nHer response of telling him she can't do that again might be necessary for her well-being, especially if his behaviors are beyond his control (like scratching could be a medical issue). But she did communicate her needs, so maybe she's not wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of almost crying might indicate he's trying, but not succeeding. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because she's advocating for her health, which is crucial, and the boyfriend's actions were disruptive despite his efforts. However, there might be a middle ground, but given the circumstances, she's justified in her decision.\n"
