Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore because he kept disturbing her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman is 23 years old, her boyfriend 26. They've been dating a few weeks. She worked a long day and was exhausted. The boyfriend's behavior included loud noises, scratching, burping, and shaking the bed. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but he kept disturbing her all night. She ended up pushing him off and even threatened to murder him if it happened again. The next morning, she told him she can't sleep with him again because of her schedule but still loves him. He cried, but she feels justified because she's tired.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants to know my opinion. \n\nLet's break it down. The main issue is her decision to sleep separately. She's justified because her health and well-being are important. Sleep is crucial, especially after a long workday. The boyfriend's behavior, while maybe unintentional, was disruptive. He apologized but didn't stop. She tried to communicate her needs, and when that failed, she took action. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. She expressed her needs clearly, and the problem wasn't resolved through his apology. The boyfriend's actions were affecting her ability to rest, which is essential for her. It's reasonable for her to prioritize her health. Also, the fact that she still loves him and is honest about her feelings shows she's not being cruel without reason.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend didn't realize how bad it was, and she could have been more patient. But given that she's been working hard and needs sleep, her reaction is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he felt hurt, but that doesn't mean her decision is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to adapt. If he can't adjust his behavior to accommodate her needs, she has a right to set boundaries. It's possible they might need to work on this issue together, but in this situation, her choice to sleep apart is a valid step to protect her well-being. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's taking care of her health and communicated her needs. The boyfriend needs to be more considerate, but she's justified in her actions.\n"
