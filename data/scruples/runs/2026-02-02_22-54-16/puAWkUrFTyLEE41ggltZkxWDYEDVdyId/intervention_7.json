Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (23F) telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a night of disturbances.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she's exhausted. Her boyfriend's behavior\u2014watching loud videos, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, and cuddling too hard\u2014keeps waking her up. She asks him to stop, he apologizes but the disturbances continue. She finally gets angry and tells him she can't do it again, even joking about murder. In the morning, she says she can't do that again and he almost cries. She feels bad but stands her ground.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't, but wants a second opinion.\n\nKey points: The boyfriend's actions caused her significant sleep disruption. Sleep is crucial, and she's clearly overworked. She communicated her needs, but the boyfriend didn't adjust. She set a boundary, which is reasonable. However, the harsh language (\"murder him\") might be seen as excessive. But given her exhaustion and the repeated disturbances, her frustration is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) suggests he might be more sensitive, but that doesn't mean her stance is wrong. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's needs. If he's being inconsiderate, she's justified in addressing it. So, her actions are in line with self-care and setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
