Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new boyfriend's behavior during the night causing the woman to not get enough sleep. She ends up telling him she can't sleep in the same bed anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman worked long hours and is exhausted. She asked him to stop his disruptive behaviors (like loud noises and movements), and even though he apologized, it kept happening. She then sets a boundary by stating she can't handle it again. Her actions seem to be about her own well-being and sleep needs, which are valid, especially after a tiring day.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. Scratching loudly, making noise, and shaking the bed are things that can disturb a partner's sleep. While he tried to apologize, the fact that he kept doing it despite being asked suggests he might not be fully aware of the impact or not respecting her needs. However, since they're in a new relationship, maybe he didn't realize the extent of the issue.\n\nThe key here is about boundaries. The woman communicated her needs and tried to resolve the issue, but when it didn't work, she took action to protect her health. It's important to prioritize rest, especially after long shifts. The boyfriend's reaction of almost crying shows he's hurt, but the woman's right to set limits is crucial in a relationship. \n\nI don't see any malicious intent from her side. She's being honest about her needs, even though it's hard. The boyfriend needs to adjust his behavior, but the woman isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
