Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who's been dating a guy for a couple of weeks. She's exhausted after a long day and can't sleep because her boyfriend is being noisy and disruptive in bed. She eventually tells him she can't sleep with him anymore, which upsets him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman is 23F, the boyfriend 26M. They've been dating a few weeks. She's worked hard and needs rest. The boyfriend's behavior includes loud noises from his phone, scratching, burping, shaking the bed. She asks him to stop, he apologizes, but it continues. She ends up being very frustrated and tells him she can't sleep with him again. He reacts emotionally, almost crying. She feels bad but stands her ground because she needs sleep.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants to confirm.\n\nI should consider communication and mutual respect here. Did she communicate her needs clearly? She did tell him to turn off his phone and was sorry she had to be harsh. He tried to apologize but the behavior continued. Her need for rest is valid, especially given her work schedule. The boyfriend's actions disrupted her sleep, which is essential for her health and job performance. \n\nHowever, the situation is new in the relationship. Maybe he's not aware of how his actions affect her. But she did communicate her discomfort, and he didn't adjust. So she's not wrong to set a boundary. It's about mutual respect for each other's needs. If he's being disruptive despite her requests, she's justified in needing her own space to sleep. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation in relationships to adapt to each other's habits. But in this case, the author is clearly in a state of needing rest, and the boyfriend's behavior is excessive. She's not refusing the relationship; she's just adjusting the sleeping arrangement temporarily. \n\nI think the answer is B. She's not in the wrong. She communicated her needs, and her health and rest are important. The boyfriend should be considerate of her needs, especially when she's tired. The fact that he kept being disruptive despite her requests shows he wasn't respecting her boundaries, so she's justified in making a change.\n"
