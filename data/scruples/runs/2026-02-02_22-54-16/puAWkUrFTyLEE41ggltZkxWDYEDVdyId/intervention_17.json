Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a guy for a couple of weeks. She's very tired after a long day at work and coaching soccer. Her boyfriend is being disruptive in bed\u2014using his phone loudly, making noises, shaking the bed, etc. She tells him to turn it off, he apologizes, but the behavior continues. She ends up threatening him in her sleep-deprived state and then tells him in the morning that she can't do that again. He's upset, but she's standing by her decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and is asking for my opinion. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is in a new relationship, just a few weeks in. She's exhausted and has a demanding schedule. The boyfriend is being pretty inconsiderate with his actions that night\u2014he's aware of her tiredness but still continues to disrupt her sleep. She's communicated her needs, but he didn't follow through. She's honest with him in the morning about her limits, even though he's upset. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. She did tell him to stop, but he didn't comply. Her response the next day is about setting boundaries, which is important, especially when health and well-being are at stake. Sleep deprivation can affect her work and other responsibilities. The boyfriend's reaction of crying shows he's hurt, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong for prioritizing her need for rest.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in a new relationship, being too direct or setting such strict boundaries could be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances\u2014her exhaustion and the repeated disruption\u2014it's reasonable for her to prioritize her needs. The boyfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and she had the right to express that.\n\nI think the key points here are the boyfriend's inconsiderate actions and the author's legitimate need for sleep. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's addressing a real problem that affects her well-being. The response she gave was after multiple attempts to resolve the issue during the night. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
