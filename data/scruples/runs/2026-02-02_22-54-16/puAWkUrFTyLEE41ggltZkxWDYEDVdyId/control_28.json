Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about the author (23F) telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. They've been dating a couple of weeks, sex is good, but last night was a mess for her.\n\nShe was really tired after work and soccer coaching. He was doing all these things on his phone\u2014watching videos, loud noises, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She asked him to turn it off, he did, but then kept disturbing her all night. He tried cuddling, which woke her up. She got so frustrated she threatened to murder him if he did it again. The next morning, she told him she can't do that again because of her schedule but still loves him. He cried, she felt bad but says she's tired.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? A says yes, B says no.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. From the author's perspective, she's exhausted, overworked, and the boyfriend's behavior disrupted her sleep. She's communicated her needs, and even though he apologized, it didn't help. She's prioritizing her health and rest, which is important. Maybe she's justified in setting a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have handled it differently. She did confront him, but perhaps she could have given him another chance or discussed it in the morning instead of being harsh. Also, threatening to murder someone is extreme, even if in frustration. But given the context, she's under a lot of stress.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a factor. He was crying, which shows he felt hurt. But he was the one causing the disturbance. The problem might be that they're new together and\u8fd8\u6ca1 fully adjusted to each other's habits. Maybe there's a communication issue here.\n\nI need to think about what's reasonable. People in relationships often have to make adjustments. But when someone's health and well-being are affected, it's more important. She's working long hours and needs sleep. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive, and she's setting a boundary to protect herself. That seems reasonable. Also, she's still expressing love, so she's not cutting things off completely.\n\nHowever, threatening violence, even in a joking way, isn't great. But given the context of extreme fatigue, maybe it's understandable. The main issue is the boyfriend's behavior being a chronic problem. If this is a one-time thing, maybe she overreacted. But if it's recurring, her decision makes sense.\n\nOverall, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her needs, the boyfriend didn't adjust, and she set a boundary for her own well-being. The answer is B.\n"
