Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he was disrupting her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 23F, and the boyfriend is 26M. They've been dating a couple of weeks. She had a long day, worked 9 hours and coached soccer. She was really tired. The boyfriend was making noises, scratching, shaking the bed, burping, etc., even after she asked him to stop. She ended up telling him to stop or she'd murder him, and in the morning, she said she can't do it again because of her schedule. He cried, but she feels she needs her sleep.\n\nSo, the key points here are her need for rest due to her workload and the boyfriend's behavior that kept her awake. She communicated her needs, but he kept disturbing her. She then set a boundary, which made him upset. The question is whether her actions were wrong.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's prioritizing her health and well-being. She's communicated her needs, and when he didn't adjust, she had to enforce it. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected because she's not allowing him to stay, but that's his reaction. The author isn't being unkind; she's honest about her needs. The situation is recent, so maybe they need to work out some logistics. But given the circumstances, her need for sleep is valid. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive despite her requests, so she's justified in setting the boundary. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
