Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, good sex, but she's exhausted from her job and soccer coaching. She's in bed, trying to sleep, but her boyfriend is making a lot of noise and disturbing her. She tells him to turn off his phone, but he keeps shaking the bed, scratching, burping, etc. She ends up being very frustrated, even saying she might murder him if he wakes her again. In the morning, she tells him she can't do that again, leading him to almost cry. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are: the woman is extremely tired after a long day, her partner is causing disturbances through his actions. She's communicated her needs, he tried to apologize but the problem continued. The situation is affecting her health and well-being. She's being direct and honest with him about her boundaries, even if her tone was harsh.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is crucial. She did tell him to stop, and when that didn't work, she reinforced her boundaries. It's reasonable for her to need rest, especially if her schedule is hectic. The boyfriend's behavior seems inconsiderate and possibly self-centered. He was aware of her tiredness but continued actions that disrupted her sleep. The woman's frustration is a valid response to her sleep being compromised. She's not being unreasonable by asking to not sleep in the same bed if he can't respect her sleep needs. The boyfriend's reaction of almost crying might be because he's unaccustomed to being told no, but that doesn't make her wrong. She's prioritizing her health, which is important. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
