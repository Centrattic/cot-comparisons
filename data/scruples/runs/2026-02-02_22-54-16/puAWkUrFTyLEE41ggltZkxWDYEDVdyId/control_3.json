Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a young woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. She's tired after a long day and wants to sleep, but her boyfriend's behavior keeps disturbing her. He does things like watching videos loudly, making noises, shaking the bed, and trying to cuddle too much. She tells him to stop, he apologizes and turns off his phone, but he continues to wake her up. Eventually, she gets so frustrated she threatens to murder him, and the next day she tells him she can't sleep with him again, even though she loves him. He gets upset, but she feels it's necessary because she's exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The woman is clearly exhausted from work and other responsibilities. Her health and well-being are important. Sleep is crucial, and being deprived of it can have serious consequences. She's trying to communicate her needs to her partner, which is a healthy relationship practice. The boyfriend, on the other hand, despite being told to stop, continues to disrupt her sleep. That's a problem. Even if he didn't mean to be loud or disruptive, he should have been more considerate of her need for rest, especially after a tiring day.\n\nBut wait, relationships often require compromise. She's being direct about her needs, which is good. However, is there a middle ground? Maybe they could have discussed it more to find a solution, like sleeping in separate rooms temporarily or using earplugs. But in this case, she's already given clear instructions, and he didn't follow through. His actions were repeated and intentional, leading to her having to make a harsh threat. That's a red flag. He should have respected her boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional response. The boyfriend almost cried, showing he's hurt by her decision. But the woman's health and ability to function the next day are also important. It's not about being cruel but about prioritizing one's own well-being. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's needs. If he can't adjust his behavior, maybe the issue is deeper. However, in this short-term relationship, she's within her rights to set boundaries.\n\nThe user's question is whether she's in the wrong. From her side, she communicated her needs, tried to resolve the issue, and when that failed, took action. The boyfriend's behavior was the initial problem. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
