Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend (23F) telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he's making too much noise and disturbing her sleep. They've been dating a couple of weeks, sex is good, but he's being loud and she's exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author worked a long shift and coached, so she's really tired. Her boyfriend's behavior\u2014noises, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014makes it hard for her to sleep. She asked him to turn off his phone, he did, but the rest continued. She tells him she can't do that again because she needs sleep. He gets upset, but she still loves him.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Let's see. She's being honest about her needs. People have different sleep needs and habits. If he's being disruptive, it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. Communication is key in relationships. She told him directly, which is good. She's not being cruel, just stating her needs. He's responsible for his actions too; maybe he could be more considerate. But she's not wrong for setting limits, especially when she's exhausted. Relationships require compromise, but her health and rest shouldn't be compromised. So probably answer B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
