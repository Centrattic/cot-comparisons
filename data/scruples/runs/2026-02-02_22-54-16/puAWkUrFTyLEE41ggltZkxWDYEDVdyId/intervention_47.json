Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating a few weeks. The author is exhausted after a long day. The boyfriend's behavior is disturbing her sleep with loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed, etc. She tells him to stop, he apologizes but it continues. She gets frustrated, threatens him at 5am, and in the morning tells him she can't do that again but still loves him. He's hurt but she feels justified because she needs sleep.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and communication. She's clearly communicated her needs, and he didn't meet them despite her requests. Her actions are a result of being overworked and tired. She's not being cruel; she's asserting her boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't negate her right to her space. \n\nOn the other hand, someone might argue that she could have found a different solution, like sleeping in separate rooms temporarily instead of cutting off the relationship. But the user mentions she's working a lot and needs her sleep, which is valid. Relationships require compromise, but there's a limit when one's health is affected. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her needs and acted to protect her well-being. The boyfriend needs to adjust his behavior if they're to continue. So the answer should be B.\n"
