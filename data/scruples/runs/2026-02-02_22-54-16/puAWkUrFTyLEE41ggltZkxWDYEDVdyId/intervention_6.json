Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a bad night. So the situation is that she worked a long day, was exhausted, and her boyfriend's behavior kept her up all night. He was loud, shaking the bed, and kept trying to cuddle, which made her push him off. She ended up telling him she can't do that again and almost said she'd murder him, but then apologized in the morning. He was upset, and she feels bad but still stands by her decision.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she was wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are her need for sleep due to her busy schedule, his disruptive behavior, and her communication of her boundaries. \n\nHer reasons for not wanting to sleep together are based on her need for rest. She's working long hours and coaching, so her health and well-being are valid concerns. The boyfriend's actions were clearly disturbing her sleep, which is a legitimate issue. She did communicate her needs, first by asking him to stop, and then more firmly when it didn't work. Her final statement, while harsh, was a result of extreme frustration and exhaustion. \n\nIs she wrong for setting that boundary? Probably not. People have the right to set personal boundaries, especially regarding their health. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he didn't expect that, but her right to prioritize her sleep isn't wrong. The question is about whether she was in the wrong, not about the relationship dynamics in general. \n\nThe user's own thought is that the author isn't wrong, which aligns with the analysis. So the answer should be B (No). The key is that she communicated her needs, albeit in a stressed state, and her reasons are valid. The boyfriend should have been more considerate of her needs as well. There's no indication she was unreasonable beyond her right to rest. So the answer is B."
