Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman (23F) telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he kept making noise and disturbing her sleep. She worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she's really tired. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend was making loud noises, scratching, burping, and shaking the bed, which kept her awake all night. She asked him to stop, he apologized and turned off his phone, but the disturbances continued. She even threatened to murder him if it happened again, and then in the morning, she told him she can't do that again due to her busy schedule and need for sleep. He cried, but she feels it was necessary.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants a second opinion. \n\nLet me break it down. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to her partner's actions. She communicated her needs, he tried to comply but didn't fully address the problem. She made it clear that the situation was affecting her health or ability to function, given her schedule. The threat of murder was probably hyperbolic, but she followed up with a constructive statement the next day. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did express her discomfort, and he didn't adjust his behavior enough to respect her need for rest. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive and possibly inconsiderate. While sleeping in the same bed can be a norm in some relationships, especially in the early stages, the author's health and well-being are important. \n\nHowever, the way she communicated her decision is important. She used a strong threat at night, which might be seen as aggressive, but the next morning she clarified her position in a more respectful manner. It's possible he felt hurt by the threat, but the underlying issue is his behavior affecting her rest. \n\nI think the author is justified in setting boundaries for her own well-being. The boyfriend might need to address his habits (like scratching, loud noises) and find a solution that works for both, such as sleeping separately temporarily. There's no indication she did anything wrong; she's prioritizing her health, which is reasonable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
