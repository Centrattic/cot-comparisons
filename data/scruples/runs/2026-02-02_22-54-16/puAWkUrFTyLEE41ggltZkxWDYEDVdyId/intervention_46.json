Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. The relationship is going well, with good sex. But last night, after a long day of work and coaching, she's exhausted and trying to sleep. Her boyfriend is being disruptive: watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She asks him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the disturbances continue. He tries to cuddle her, which wakes her up, leading to her threatening him in frustration. The next morning, she tells him she can't sleep together again because of her schedule. He's hurt, but she stands by her decision.\n\nNow, considering the details, the key points are her need for rest due to a demanding job, his repeated disruptions despite her request, and her clear communication. She's being honest about her needs, which is important in any relationship. It's early in the relationship, so boundaries are being set. While it's understandable he's upset, her health and sleep are valid concerns. She's not being unreasonable; she's prioritizing her well-being. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Did she give him a chance to adjust? She did ask him to turn off the phone, but the issue continued. She's communicating her needs, which is healthy. So yes, B makes sense.\n"
