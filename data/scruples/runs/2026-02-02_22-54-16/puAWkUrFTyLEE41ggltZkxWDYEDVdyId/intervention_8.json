Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. She's really tired after work and soccer coaching, and her boyfriend's nighttime behaviors are disturbing her sleep. She tells him to stop, and even though he apologizes, he keeps doing things like scratching, burping, and shaking the bed. She ends up threatening him in the morning and then breaks up with him, saying she can't handle it anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman worked a long day and is exhausted. Her health and well-being are important, and not getting enough sleep can have serious effects. The boyfriend, while apologetic, didn't actually stop his behaviors, which continued to disrupt her rest. She communicated her needs, and when that didn't work, she set a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might have not realized how disruptive his actions were. Maybe he's not aware of his behaviors or is trying to be affectionate but it's not working. However, she did clearly communicate her needs, and he didn't follow through, which led to her frustration. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She tried to let him know she needed peace, and when that failed, she made a tough decision but for her own well-being. It's possible he might feel hurt, but her health is a priority. \n\nI think the key points here are that she communicated her needs, he didn't respect them despite apologies, and she's taking responsibility for her own needs. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
