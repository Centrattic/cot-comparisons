Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend not to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep multiple times. \n\nFirst, she's been dating him for a few weeks. She works a 9-hour shift and coaches soccer for 2 hours. She's exhausted. Her boyfriend is making a lot of noise\u2014watching videos, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She couldn't sleep, kept waking up, and got so frustrated she threatened to murder him. In the morning, she told him she can't do that again because of her schedule, even though she loves him. He almost cried, but she feels justified.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From her side, she's clearly in a state of needing rest. Her job and coaching are taking a toll, and not sleeping would be detrimental to her health and performance. She communicated her needs and tried to resolve it, but he didn't stop. Then she set a boundary, which is reasonable when someone isn't respecting your needs.\n\nFrom his perspective, he might feel hurt or rejected. He apologized and turned off his phone, but maybe he's unaware of how disruptive his actions are. If they're in the early stages of the relationship, maybe he's not used to her strict sleep schedule. But her actions were about her health and well-being, which are important.\n\nThe key points are her need for sleep and his not respecting that despite her requests. She's not trying to be cruel but is prioritizing her needs. In relationships, communication and boundaries are important. She addressed the issue and set a boundary when necessary. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
