Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new relationship where the woman is exhausted from work and coaching, and the guy is being disruptive while they're sharing a bed. She tells him she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The woman has been up for a long time, working and coaching, so she's really tired. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014loud phone use, scratching, burping, bed shaking\u2014keeps waking her up. She asks him to stop, he apologizes but the disturbances continue. She even threatens to hurt him if he wakes her again. Next morning, she tells him she can't do this again and he gets emotional.\n\nNow, thinking about the expectations in a relationship. Communication is key. She did communicate her needs, and he tried to comply but maybe couldn't help himself. However, if his actions are beyond his control (like scratching due to an itch or medical issue), that's different. But the description here sounds like he's being careless. Her needing rest is valid, especially with her work schedule. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's asserting her need for sleep, which is important for her well-being. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but the problem started with his actions affecting her rest. She's setting a boundary, which is reasonable. So, maybe she's not wrong. But some might argue that she could have tried a different approach before deciding to sleep separately, like discussing it more or finding a middle ground. However, given her exhaustion and the repeated disturbances, her decision to sleep apart seems justified. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's prioritizing her health and setting necessary boundaries.\n"
