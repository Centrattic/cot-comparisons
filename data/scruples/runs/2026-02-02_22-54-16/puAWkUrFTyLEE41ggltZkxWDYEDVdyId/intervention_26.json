Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a 23F) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a bad night's sleep.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend's behavior during the night was disruptive\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed. The author tried to communicate her needs but the disturbances continued, leading her to set a boundary. She felt it necessary to sleep separately for her well-being.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, she expressed her needs clearly after the first incident but the boyfriend didn't adjust. Her response to protect her sleep is understandable, especially since she has a demanding schedule. Sleep is crucial, and chronic lack of it can affect health. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important for both parties' well-being.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he might be upset, but that doesn't negate the author's right to prioritize her needs. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner's habits are affecting the other's health, it's reasonable to seek a solution. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's addressing a legitimate issue that impacts her daily functioning.\n\nThere's no indication she's being cruel for no reason. She still affirmed her love, showing consideration. The boyfriend's behavior was the initial problem. So, the answer is B.\n"
