Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman in a new relationship with her boyfriend. She's worked a long day, including a 9-hour shift and soccer coaching, and is exhausted. When they're in bed, her boyfriend is being loud and disruptive\u2014watching videos, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She tells him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the rest of the night is still bad. She can't sleep because of his actions and finally snaps in the morning, telling him she can't handle it again and that she loves him but needs sleep. He cries, and she feels bad but is tired.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she's the one asking for AITA, so she's probably expecting advice. Her actions were telling him to stop the noise, which he did partially, but the problem continued. She set a boundary in the morning, which is reasonable. She's worked hard and needs rest. Her boyfriend's behavior was disruptive and potentially inconsiderate. She communicated her needs, which is healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) might indicate he felt hurt, but the root issue is his actions affecting her well-being. Sleep is crucial, especially after a long day. She's not being cruel; she's prioritizing her health. So, the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
