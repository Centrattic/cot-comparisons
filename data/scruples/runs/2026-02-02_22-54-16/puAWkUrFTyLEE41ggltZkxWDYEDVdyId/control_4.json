Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she's a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship with a 26-year-old guy. They've been dating a few weeks, and things are going well otherwise. The problem is about sleeping in the same bed.\n\nShe had a tough day: worked 9 hours and coached soccer for 2 hours. She's exhausted and just wants to sleep. Her boyfriend, however, is being disruptive with his phone use, loud noises, scratching, and shaking the bed. She tells him to turn it off, he apologizes, but the disturbances continue all night. She ends up threatening him and in the morning tells him she can't sleep with him again. He's upset, but she feels justified because she's tired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. She's clearly stressed and overworked, and her health and well-being are important. Sleep is crucial, especially when someone's working such long hours. If her partner is consistently disturbing her sleep, that's a significant issue. She communicated her needs to him, but he didn't stop, leading to her having to take more drastic measures.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected when she says she can't sleep with him. Maybe he's not aware of how his actions are affecting her, or perhaps he's trying to be affectionate with the cuddling but it's causing her discomfort. However, he did apologize when she first asked him to stop, so maybe he tried to correct his behavior but wasn't successful. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. She expressed her needs clearly, and he failed to accommodate them, leading to her having to set boundaries. Her actions were about her health and well-being, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he's hurt, but that doesn't negate her right to rest. \n\nIn relationships, especially new ones, it's important to establish boundaries. The author isn't being cruel; she's setting limits to protect her health. There's no indication she's being unreasonable or that her actions are malicious. She still loves him and is being honest about her needs. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's prioritizing her well-being, which is essential. The boyfriend might need to work on his behavior, but that's on him. The answer should be B.\n"
