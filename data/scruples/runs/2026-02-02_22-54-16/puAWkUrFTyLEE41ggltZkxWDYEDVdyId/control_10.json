Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author (23F) telling her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he was disturbing her sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend was doing several things that kept her awake: watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc. She asked him to turn off his phone, and he did, but the disturbances continued all night. She even got up to the point of threatening to murder him if he woke her again. In the morning, she apologized but said she can't sleep with him again because of her busy schedule and need for sleep.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether she's in the wrong. The main issue here is the right to a good night's sleep versus the boyfriend's behavior. The boyfriend might have not realized how his actions were affecting her, but the key is that she communicated her needs. She did try to address the problem by asking him to turn off his phone, but it didn't resolve the issue. Her response of threatening to murder him was obviously in a joking or hyperbolic way, but she followed up in the morning with a more serious statement about not sleeping together again.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. She expressed her discomfort and explained her reasons. It's important to consider if there's a middle ground, but given her exhaustion from work and the fact that the disturbances continued despite her request, her decision to not sleep in the same bed seems reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction of almost crying shows that he might not have considered the impact of his actions, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong for setting a boundary.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend should have been more considerate, but the author also could have tried to address the problem differently. However, she did communicate her needs, and the boyfriend didn't adjust even after being asked. Her need for sleep is valid, especially with her work schedule. So, she's not in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
