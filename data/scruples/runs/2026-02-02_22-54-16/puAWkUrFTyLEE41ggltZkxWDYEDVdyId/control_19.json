He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who tells her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: she's a 23-year-old woman, dating a 26-year-old man for a couple of weeks. Their relationship seems good, and they have good sex. But last night was an issue. She had a long day, worked 9 hours and coached soccer for 2 hours, so she was really tired. When they went to bed, the boyfriend was doing various disruptive things\u2014watching videos, making loud noises, scratching, shaking the bed. She asked him to turn his phone off, which he did, but he kept disturbing her throughout the night. Each time she pushed him off when he cuddled too hard. By 5 AM, she was so frustrated she threatened to murder him. In the morning, she apologized but said she can't do that again because of her busy schedule. The boyfriend got emotional, but she felt bad but emphasized her need for sleep.\n\nNow, the question is whether she was in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's analyze from both sides.\n\nFrom her perspective: She had a very long day, needed rest. She communicated her needs by asking him to turn off his phone. When he didn't stop the disturbances, she tried to push him off. Eventually, she set a boundary by telling him she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed again. Her main concern is her health and well-being because of her demanding schedule. It's reasonable to prioritize sleep, especially when working long hours.\n\nFrom his perspective: He might feel hurt or rejected because she's ending the physical relationship. He apologized when she first asked, but his actions continued to disrupt her. However, maybe he didn't realize the extent of the disturbance, or he was uncomfortable and scratching for a reason (like an itch or medical issue). But her main point is about her need for sleep.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did communicate her needs, but maybe she could have given him another chance to adjust. However, considering her exhaustion and the fact that he kept disturbing her even after she asked, her decision to set a boundary seems justified. It's not about being right or wrong, but about mutual respect for each other's needs. Since he was aware of her tiredness and still couldn't stop, her choice to prioritize her health is valid. Also, given the short time they've been dating, it's possible they're still figuring out each other's boundaries. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe she should have discussed this earlier or tried to find a compromise, like sleeping in separate rooms without ending the sleeping arrangement entirely. But given the circumstances\u2014extreme fatigue and repeated disturbances\u2014her reaction is understandable. Ending the bed-sharing might be necessary for her well-being. \n\nI think the key points are her communication, the severity of the disturbances, and her need for sleep. She's not being inconsiderate; she's setting a boundary to protect her health. Therefore, the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
