Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed.\n\nSo the situation: They've been dating a few weeks. She worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she's exhausted. Her boyfriend is being noisy and disruptive in bed\u2014watching videos, loud sounds, scratching, etc. She asks him to turn it off, he does, but then continues to disturb her all night. She gets angry, says she can't do that again, and he's upset. She feels bad but also needs rest.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if her actions are justified. She's clearly communicated her needs to him after he was already disruptive. He tried to cuddle her, which she didn't want because it woke her up. Her schedule is hectic, so sleep is crucial. She's in a new relationship, and setting boundaries is important. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have tried to be more patient or found a middle ground. But the boyfriend's behavior was repeated despite her asking. She's prioritizing her health and needs, which is understandable. He was sorry but still continued the disruptive actions. \n\nI think she's justified in setting this boundary. The key points are: her right to rest, communication, and the boyfriend's failure to respect her needs after being asked. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
