Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation described is that the boyfriend was making a lot of noise and causing disturbances during the night. The author was very tired after a long day and couldn't sleep because of his actions. She even mentioned she almost threatened to murder him if he woke her again, but in the morning, she told him she can't do it again and still loves him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both parties. The boyfriend was being loud, scratching, burping, and shaking the bed, which are all disruptive behaviors. The author tried to communicate her needs, first by asking him to turn off his phone, then by pushing him off when he cuddled too hard. Her final statement in the morning was about needing sleep due to her busy schedule. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she had the right to ask for peace and quiet to get rest, especially after working long hours. Her response to his continued disturbance was a strong reaction, but it was a one-time refusal. The boyfriend's behavior seems to be the main issue here. He was being disruptive despite her requests, which could indicate a lack of consideration for her needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to be more accommodating if possible, but her job and responsibilities are demanding. People have different needs, and if his actions are affecting her health or ability to function, it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. \n\nThe key point is whether her refusal is justified. Since he was causing her distress and she made it clear she needs sleep, she isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend needs to adjust his behavior or respect her decision if she wants separate sleeping arrangements. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
