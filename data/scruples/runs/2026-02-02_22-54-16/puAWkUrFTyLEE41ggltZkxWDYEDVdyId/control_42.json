Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed because he's keeping her up with his habits.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author worked a long day and is exhausted. She tried to sleep but was disturbed by his actions like watching videos, loud noises, and shaking the bed. She asked him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up threatening him, and in the morning, she told him she can't do that again. He was upset, but she felt her schedule required rest.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she had a valid reason: needing her sleep. She communicated her feelings, even if harshly. But maybe she could have handled it differently? However, the boyfriend's behavior was also a problem. He was being disruptive despite her request. The key points are communication, mutual respect, and the impact of sleep on health.\n\nHer actions were a result of being overworked and sleep-deprived. While she could have been kinder, her main issue was legitimate. The boyfriend's reaction of crying might indicate he felt hurt, but the root cause is his behavior affecting her well-being. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because her needs are valid, and she communicated her boundaries. The boyfriend should also adjust his behavior for her comfort. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
