Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a guy for a couple of weeks. She's exhausted from work and coaching, and he's being loud and disruptive in bed. She tells him to stop, but he doesn't, and she ends up threatening him. The next day, she apologizes but says she can't sleep with him again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman is clearly in a physically demanding job and has a hectic schedule. Her need for rest is valid. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014watching videos, making noise, scratching, burping, etc.\u2014is disruptive and shows a lack of consideration for her needs. He apologized once but didn't stop, so his actions were continuing to affect her sleep. \n\nShe set boundaries by telling him to stop and later expressing that she can't continue sleeping with him. Her response, while harsh (\"murder him\"), was in a moment of frustration. She also followed up with an apology in the morning, indicating she cares about the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected. He was trying to cuddle, which is a normal couple activity, and she pushed him off. However, his actions were the initial problem here. \n\nThe key points are about mutual respect and communication. She communicated her needs clearly, and he didn't respect them. The author isn't wrong to prioritize her health and well-being. Relationships require both parties to adapt, but in this case, the boyfriend didn't make necessary adjustments. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because she's asserting her needs and health, which is essential in a relationship. The boyfriend needs to be more considerate and responsive to her boundaries.\n"
