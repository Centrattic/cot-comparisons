Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old woman telling her 26-year-old boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a very disruptive night. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman worked a long shift and coached soccer, so she was exhausted. The boyfriend was being loud, shaking the bed, scratching, burping, etc., even after she asked him to turn off his phone. He tried to cuddle and woke her up multiple times. She threatened to kill him if he did it again. In the morning, she told him she can't do that again but still loves him. He almost cried, and she feels bad but is also tired.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The boyfriend's behavior was clearly disruptive, and the woman had a right to want to sleep. However, the way she handled it\u2014threatening him and then being firm\u2014might be seen as harsh. But considering the circumstances, her need for rest is valid. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did ask him to turn off his phone and he tried to apologize. But the problem persisted. If he's unable to adjust his behavior to accommodate her needs, it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. The threat of murder is extreme, but given her exhaustion, it might be an emotional reaction rather than malicious intent. \n\nFactors to consider: The boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but she also needs to communicate her needs without threats. Maybe she could have addressed it differently, but her main point is about needing sleep, which is legitimate. Her decision to not sleep in the same bed is a boundary, which is okay if both parties can respect it. The boyfriend's reaction shows he's upset, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was the main issue, and she had the right to set boundaries for her well-being.\n"
