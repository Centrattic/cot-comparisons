Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 23-year-old woman in a new relationship (a few weeks) with a 26-year-old man. They have a good sex life, but she's been very tired after work and coaching. Last night, her boyfriend was being disruptive in bed\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She told him to turn off his phone, he apologized, but she kept waking up all night. She got frustrated and even threatened to murder him if he woke her again. The next day, she told him she couldn't do that again because she needs sleep but still loves him. He almost cried, and she feels bad but is tired.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me think about the key points. She's in a new relationship, so communication might be a factor. She's clearly exhausted from work and coaching, which is valid. She tried to communicate her needs by asking him to turn off his phone, but the disturbances continued. She escalated her response, which led to a harsh comment. He apologized initially but the problem recurred. She then set a boundary the next day, explaining her need for sleep.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, she tried to address the issue. However, her response of threatening to murder him is extreme. Even if she was tired and frustrated, that kind of language is not healthy in a relationship. It's possible that her frustration led to an outburst, which could be seen as crossing a line, even if her intentions were to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, he might have been unaware of how disruptive his actions were, even after she asked him to stop. But in a new relationship, it's important to respect each other's needs. She's valid in needing sleep, but her method of communication (threatening murder) is not appropriate. The fact that she felt the need to set such a strong boundary suggests that there was a problem beyond his initial behavior.\n\nHer final message to him was about her schedule and needing sleep, which is reasonable. He cried, which might indicate that he felt hurt or misunderstood. So while her need for sleep is valid, her methods of addressing it (threatening language) are problematic. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for her reaction, even if her underlying issue is legitimate.\n\nBut maybe the bigger issue is that he continued to be disruptive despite her asking him to stop. If he didn't address that, then he's partly to blame. However, the question is about the author's wrongness. Her threatening to murder him is a red flag. Even if she was tired, that's not a healthy way to communicate. So perhaps she's in the wrong for her reaction, even if the situation is not entirely her fault. The answer would be A, yes, she's in the wrong for her extreme response, even though her need for sleep is valid.\n"
