Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23F who's been dating a 26M for a few weeks. She's worked hard and needs sleep, but her boyfriend's nighttime behaviors are disturbing her rest. She tells him she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman is clearly exhausted from work and coaching, and her boyfriend's actions\u2014like loud noises, scratching, burping, and shaking the bed\u2014are affecting her sleep. She's communicated her needs, but he's not making it easier. She then sets a boundary by telling him she can't do that again, which makes him upset. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel rejected or hurt because she's choosing not to be in the same bed. But his actions are objectively disruptive. It's important to note that sleep is a basic need, and the woman is within her rights to prioritize her health. The boyfriend's apology and attempts to cuddle might be genuine, but they don't address the underlying issues causing her discomfort.\n\nAlso, considering the relationship is new (a few weeks), she's still figuring out boundaries. It's reasonable for her to set them without being in the wrong. The fact that she apologized and explained her reasons shows she's considerate, but her need for rest is valid. The boyfriend's reaction, while emotional, doesn't negate her right to her own space when needed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the woman isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her health and setting necessary boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
