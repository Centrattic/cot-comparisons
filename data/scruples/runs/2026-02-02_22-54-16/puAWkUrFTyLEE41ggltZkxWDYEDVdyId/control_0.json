Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the woman (23F) tells her boyfriend (26M) she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a rough night of disturbances. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman had a long day, worked 9 hours, coached soccer for 2 hours. She was very tired. Her boyfriend was making a lot of noise\u2014watching videos, loud burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She asked him to turn off the phone, which he did, but the disturbances continued. She kept waking up, tried to push him off when he cuddled too hard. Then in the morning, she told him she can't do that again and he almost cried, but she feels it's necessary because of her schedule and need for sleep.\n\nNow, the key points here. She's communicated her needs clearly. She asked him to stop the behaviors that were affecting her sleep. He apologized but the problem continued. She was in a vulnerable state, exhausted, and her health and well-being are important. Sleep is crucial, especially after such a hectic day. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive despite her requests.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not making this up. She's being honest about her needs. It's reasonable to ask for a separate sleeping arrangement if co-sleeping is causing significant issues. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he might feel rejected, but her need for sleep is legitimate. There's no indication she was rude or unreasonable beyond stating her needs. She even mentioned she loves him, so it's not about rejecting the relationship but about self-care.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should have addressed the issue earlier, or tried to find a compromise like using earplugs or separate beds temporarily. But the situation escalated to the point where she felt she needed to set a boundary. The boyfriend's continued behavior despite her requests suggests he wasn't respecting her needs. So, she's not the one in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No). The woman is justified in setting this boundary for her well-being.\n"
