Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The woman is 23, the boyfriend is 26. They've been dating a few weeks. The woman worked a long day and was super tired. The boyfriend was making a lot of noise, scratching, burping, shaking the bed. She told him to stop, he apologized and turned his phone off, but still kept disturbing her sleep. She couldn't sleep, pushed him off when he cuddled too hard, and eventually threatened to murder him in her head. In the morning, she told him she couldn't do that again because of her schedule and that she still loved him. He almost cried, but she felt bad.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. From the woman's perspective, she was exhausted and needed rest. The boyfriend's behavior was disruptive and didn't stop even after being asked. She communicated her needs clearly, even if she felt bad about it. On the other hand, the boyfriend might have felt rejected or hurt when told not to sleep with her again. But in a relationship, communication is key. She was assertive about her needs, which is reasonable. Her actions were to prioritize her health and schedule, which is important. The boyfriend's inability to adjust his behavior after being asked could be his fault, but the woman isn't wrong for setting boundaries. So, the answer is B.\n"
