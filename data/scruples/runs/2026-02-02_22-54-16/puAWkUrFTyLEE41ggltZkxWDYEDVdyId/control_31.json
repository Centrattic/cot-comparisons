Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after he disturbed her sleep multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman worked a long shift and coached, so she was very tired. Her boyfriend was making noises, shaking the bed, and trying to cuddle too hard, making her sleepless. She told him to stop, he tried to comply but kept disturbing her again. She threatened him in the morning but still showed affection. He was upset, but she felt justified because of her exhaustion.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and relationships. In many relationships, partners try to accommodate each other's needs. However, when there's a direct impact on health, like lack of sleep due to a partner's behavior, it's a valid concern. The woman communicated her needs, and even though he apologized, the problem persisted. She took action to protect her well-being, which is understandable. \n\nBut does that make her wrong? If she's prioritizing her health and clearly communicated her boundaries, then no. However, some might argue that she should have tried to resolve it with compromise first. But given the circumstances\u2014she was exhausted, repeatedly disturbed, and even threatened when pushed to the limit\u2014her decision to not sleep together might be seen as a last resort.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he's hurt, but the woman's health and ability to function are important. The story also mentions she still loves him, so it's not about rejection but about need. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was reasonable given the situation. Here, the woman's action seems justified. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
