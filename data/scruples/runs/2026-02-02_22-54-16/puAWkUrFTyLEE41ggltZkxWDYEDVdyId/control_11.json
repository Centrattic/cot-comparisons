Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe woman (23F) is in a new relationship with a 26M guy. They have a good connection, and sex is great. But after a long day of work and coaching, she's exhausted and wants to sleep. Her boyfriend is disruptive: watching videos loudly, burping, scratching himself, shaking the bed, and cuddling too hard. She tells him to turn his phone off, and he apologizes, but the disturbances continue all night. She ends up threatening him in her sleep-deprived state and in the morning tells him she can't do that again. He's upset, but she feels she's justified because she's tired.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. First, the boyfriend's behavior: he's being loud, disruptive, and not respecting her need for sleep. She's worked a long day and needs rest, which is important for her well-being. She's communicated her needs, but he's not respecting them. She's trying to set a boundary, which is understandable. However, the way she communicates it\u2014saying she might murder him\u2014is harsh and could be seen as extreme. But considering the context, she's extremely tired and frustrated. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt because she's not wanting to be with him, even if the issue is about sleep. But he's the one causing the problem. In relationships, communication is key, and she did try to talk to him, but the problem persisted. Setting boundaries around sleep is reasonable. While her threat was maybe not the best way to express it, the underlying issue is about her health and well-being. \n\nSo, the main factors are: his behavior is disruptive, she's communicated her needs, she's set a boundary for her health, and the threat was a result of her stress. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he's sensitive, but he also needs to consider her needs. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. Since she's not being unreasonable in wanting to sleep, and he's not respecting that, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
