Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new relationship where the woman is dealing with her boyfriend's bed habits.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman is 23, has been dating a 26-year-old for a couple of weeks. The sex is good, but she's been working a long shift and coaching, so she's really tired. The boyfriend's actions during the night\u2014watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014are disturbing her sleep. She asked him to turn off the phone, which he did, but the other issues continued. She pushed him off when he cuddled too hard and eventually told him she couldn't handle it again, even saying she'd murder him if he woke her up more. In the morning, she apologized but felt bad.\n\nSo, the key points here are her need for rest due to her schedule and the boyfriend's disruptive behavior. The question is whether she's in the wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did ask him to turn off his phone, which he did, but other habits like scratching and shaking the bed are beyond his control. However, maybe he could have been more considerate of her tired state. But she's also in a new relationship, and being upfront about her needs is important for her well-being. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) suggests he might be sensitive, but that doesn't mean she's wrong for setting a boundary. She's justified in needing her sleep, especially with her demanding schedule. The fact that she apologized and reassured her love shows she's not being harsh without reason.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should have discussed her sleep needs before the situation happened, but it's also reasonable to address issues as they come up, especially in a new relationship. Also, the boyfriend might not realize the extent of his behaviors, but she did communicate her feelings.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's prioritizing her health and has the right to set boundaries. The answer should be B (No).\n"
