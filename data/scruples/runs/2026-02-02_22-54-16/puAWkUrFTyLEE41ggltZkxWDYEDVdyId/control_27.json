Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new relationship where the woman, after a long day, is disturbed by her boyfriend's nighttime habits. She tells him she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed again.\n\nFirst, consider the context: she worked 9 hours and coached for 2, so she's exhausted. Her needs for rest are valid. The boyfriend's actions\u2014noisy phone use, loud noises, bed shaking\u2014are disruptive. Even after she asked him to stop, the disturbances continued, leading her to set a boundary.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. She communicated her needs clearly, and when they weren't met, she took action to protect her well-being. Her response (saying she can't do it again) is a boundary, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend's reaction (crying) shows he was affected, but that doesn't negate her right to set boundaries. Relationships require both parties to adjust. Since the issue is about her basic need for sleep and he didn't respect that despite being told, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
