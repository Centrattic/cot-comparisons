Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, good sex. Last night, after a long day of work and coaching, she's exhausted and trying to sleep. Her boyfriend is being disruptive: watching videos on his phone, making loud noises, scratching loudly, burping, shaking the bed, etc. She asks him to turn off his phone, which he does, but throughout the night, the disturbances continue. He tries to cuddle her, which wakes her up each time. She even threatens him in the night, and in the morning, she tells him she can't do that again because of her schedule and needs sleep, which makes him almost cry. She feels bad but also is frustrated because she's tired.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's consider the context. She's been up a long time, working 9 hours and coaching soccer. She's exhausted. Her main need is to sleep, which is crucial for her well-being. The boyfriend's behavior is disturbing her sleep, even after she's asked him to stop. He's making loud noises, shaking the bed, and trying to cuddle, which she's clearly not comfortable with. \n\nShe communicates her needs to him, and even though he apologizes and turns off the phone, the disturbances continue. She's not just being a bother; she's had a very long day and needs rest. The fact that she has a crazy schedule implies she needs consistent sleep to manage her responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend seems to be unaware of how his actions affect her sleep. He might not realize that his scratching, burping, etc., are causing her to wake up. The cuddling attempts, while maybe meant to be affectionate, are waking her up because he's pushing her too hard. She's communicating her boundaries, and after that, she's left with no choice but to express her frustration.\n\nBut the key point here is the communication. She told him she needed to sleep, and he tried to comply but didn't fully address the issue. Her response of threatening to murder him if he kept waking her up is clearly an exaggeration, but that's in the moment of frustration. In the morning, she apologizes and explains she still loves him but can't handle that again.\n\nIs she in the wrong for standing up for her needs? It seems like she's in a situation where she needs to prioritize her health and work schedule. If the boyfriend isn't respecting her sleep, which is essential for her, then she's justified in setting boundaries. The fact that she's been clear and he still didn't adjust his behavior might mean he's not being considerate enough, but the author is acting in her own interest. \n\nHowever, some might argue that in a relationship, especially a new one, it's important to be accommodating to each other's needs. But in this case, the boyfriend's actions are disruptive and he didn't fully comply with her request. She's not being unreasonable by asking for a good night's sleep. The boyfriend might need to adjust his habits if they continue to sleep together. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's clearly communicating her needs, especially after a long day, and taking steps to ensure her well-being. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
