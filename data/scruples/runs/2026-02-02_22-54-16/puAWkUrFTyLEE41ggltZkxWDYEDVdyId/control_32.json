Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (a 23-year-old woman) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed after a bad night. The situation is that she's exhausted from work and coaching, and her boyfriend kept disturbing her sleep with his phone, noises, scratching, etc. She told him to stop, which he did, but she kept waking up. The next morning, she said she can't do that again, and he almost cried. The question is whether she's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her reasons. She's been working a lot, and sleep is crucial for her well-being. The boyfriend's actions were disruptive\u2014using his phone loudly, making noises, scratching, shaking the bed. Even after she asked him to stop, the disturbances continued. She tried to communicate her needs and even apologized, but he was emotional about it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend felt hurt or rejected when she said she can't sleep with him anymore. But his behavior that night was clearly affecting her ability to rest. She's in a new relationship, so boundaries are being established. It's important for both partners to respect each other's needs. She's not being cruel; she's setting a boundary for her health. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of almost crying might indicate that he values the relationship but perhaps didn't realize the extent of her discomfort. However, her actions were necessary for her well-being. The key points are communication and mutual respect. She communicated her needs, and while he may feel upset, her right to a good night's sleep is valid. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
