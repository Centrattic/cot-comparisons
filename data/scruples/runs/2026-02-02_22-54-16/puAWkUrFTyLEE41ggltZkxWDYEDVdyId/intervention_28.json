Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the woman is exhausted from work and soccer coaching, and her boyfriend is making a lot of noise and movements all night, disturbing her sleep. She tells him to turn off his phone, but he keeps moving and making noise. She ends up pushing him off when he cuddles too hard and in the morning, she can't do it again and breaks up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman is clearly in a state of extreme fatigue, which affects her well-being. Her job demands a lot, and she needs rest. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014watching videos loudly, scratching, burping, coughing, shaking the bed\u2014is disruptive. Even after being asked to stop, he doesn't seem to fully address the issue. The woman's response is frustration leading to a breakup. \n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's perspective, maybe he's not aware of how his actions are affecting her. He might be trying to be affectionate by cuddling, but it's too much for her. However, the problem is that his actions are causing her significant distress and sleep deprivation. \n\nThe woman's decision to end the relationship is about her need for rest and her inability to cope with his habits. Sleep is essential for health, and if someone's partner is consistently disrupting it, that's a valid concern. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) might indicate he's unaware or doesn't realize the severity. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? If she communicated her needs clearly and he didn't adjust, then she's not at fault. People have different needs, and if both sides aren't meeting each other's, it's a valid reason to part ways. The key here is that the woman prioritized her health and set boundaries, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's behaviors are the main issue here, not her response to them. \n\nSo, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
