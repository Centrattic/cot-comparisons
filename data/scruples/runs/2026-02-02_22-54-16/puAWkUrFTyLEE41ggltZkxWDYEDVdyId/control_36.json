Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the woman is 23 and has been dating the guy for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, with good sex. The problem arose when she was exhausted after a long day of work and coaching. In bed, the boyfriend was making a lot of noise and movements\u2014watching videos, loud talking, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. Despite her asking him to turn off his phone, the disturbances continued all night. She ended up being very frustrated, even threatening to kill him if he woke her again. The next morning, she told him she can't do that again due to her schedule and needed sleep, and he almost cried. She feels bad but is tired.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The boyfriend's actions were clearly disruptive. Loud noises and movements during the night can be very stressful, especially for someone who's already tired. She tried to communicate her needs, and he apologized but didn't change his behavior. Sleep is essential for her well-being, and if his actions are consistently preventing her from getting it, that's a legitimate concern. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries, especially in a new relationship where they might not have established sleeping habits yet. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected when she says she doesn't want to sleep with him. But the core issue is his behavior affecting her rest. She's not asking to end the relationship but to address the sleeping arrangement. It's about her health and schedule. Since he was apologetic but couldn't adjust, her decision to prioritize her needs makes sense. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She communicated her needs and is prioritizing her well-being in a healthy way.\n"
