Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the woman in the situation) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The scenario involves her being exhausted after a long day, dealing with her partner's behaviors that disrupt her sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She worked 9 hours and coached soccer, so she's really tired. Her partner's actions\u2014talking loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed\u2014clearly disturb her rest. She asked him to turn his phone off, and he apologized, but the disturbances continued. She even felt the need to say she'd murder him if he woke her again. In the morning, she explains she can't do that again because she needs her sleep.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. She did tell him to turn off his phone, which he did, but then other issues persisted. Her actions in the morning were to set a boundary to ensure her well-being. Prioritizing her health and rest is important, especially when she's working long hours. However, ending the relationship because of sleep issues might seem extreme, but if it's a recurring problem that affects her mental and physical health, it's a valid reason.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) suggests he was hurt, but she felt it was necessary for her own needs. The question is whether her response was justified. She's not being inconsiderate of her partner's feelings, but her health and work schedule take precedence. It's a balance between relationship maintenance and personal well-being. Since she still loves him but can't compromise on her sleep, it's a matter of personal boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
