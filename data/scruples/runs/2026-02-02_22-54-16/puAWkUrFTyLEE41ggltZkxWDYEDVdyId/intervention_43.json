Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed anymore. The situation described is that the boyfriend's behaviors during the night disturbed her sleep. She's tired from work and coaching, and after multiple interruptions, she's had enough. She communicated this, and even though he apologized, it kept happening. She then tells him she can't do it again and that she still loves him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Sleep is crucial for health and well-being, and chronic sleep deprivation can have serious consequences. The woman has legitimate reasons for needing rest, especially given her demanding schedule. The boyfriend's actions\u2014noises, movements, etc.\u2014are clearly disrupting her ability to sleep. Even after being asked to stop, the disturbances continued. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. She did tell him to turn off his phone and he did, but other issues persisted. She made her feelings clear in the morning, explaining her need for sleep. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he's upset, but the woman's health and well-being are also important. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From the description, she's standing up for her needs, which is reasonable. He might need to adjust his behavior, maybe through changes like taking a bath before bed, using a sleeping aid, or addressing any underlying issues (like allergies if the coughing is due to that). However, it's also possible that he's unaware of how disruptive his actions are, even after being told. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, setting boundaries is essential. If the boyfriend can't respect her need for rest, it might indicate a larger issue. But the woman isn't being unreasonable here. She's not rejecting him entirely but is prioritizing her health. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend tried to apologize and she's overreacting. But given the repeated disruptions and her exhaustion, her reaction is justified. Also, she still affirmed her feelings for him, so it's not a hostile act. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's taking care of her needs and communicating them, which is healthy in a relationship. It's up to the boyfriend to adapt or find solutions, not necessarily that she's at fault.\n"
