Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a 26-year-old man for a few weeks. They have a good relationship, good sex, but there's a problem with sleep. The woman is exhausted from work and coaching, and her boyfriend's nighttime behaviors\u2014watching videos, loud noises, scratching, moving around\u2014disturb her sleep. She tells him to turn off his phone, which he does, but the disturbances continue. She ends up threatening to murder him in her head and then tells him she can't do that again because of her schedule. He's upset, and she feels bad but also needs rest.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The main issue is sleep disruption. The woman is clearly exhausted, which affects her ability to function. The boyfriend's actions are causing repeated disturbances, despite her asking him to stop. She communicates her needs, which is important. The boyfriend's reaction (almost crying) shows he's sensitive, but his behavior is problematic. \n\nIs the woman wrong for expressing her need? Probably not. Communicating boundaries is a healthy part of any relationship. She's not being aggressive, just stating her need for rest. The boyfriend's inability to adjust his behavior could be a sign of immaturity or not considering her needs, but that doesn't make her wrong. She's prioritizing her well-being, which is valid. The fact that she still loves him and is kind in her communication suggests she's not being unreasonable. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe some would say that early in a relationship, you should be more tolerant. But even then, mutual respect for each other's needs is crucial. Her job and responsibilities mean she needs sleep, so asking to not share a bed is reasonable. The boyfriend's actions are disruptive regardless of the relationship stage. \n\nAlso, the woman's threat (\"murder him\") is internal, not verbal or physical, so it's understandable given her frustration. The morning after, she's honest about her feelings, which shows maturity. \n\nSo the conclusion is that she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
