Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation is that after a long day of work and coaching, she's really tired and trying to sleep. Her boyfriend is making a lot of noise and movements, like watching videos on his phone, loud burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She tells him to turn his phone off, which he does, but the disturbances continue all night. She ends up getting very frustrated and tells him she can't sleep with him again, even mentioning she'd murder him if he did. The next morning, she apologizes and says she still loves him, but he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her actions are justified. She worked 9 hours and coached for 2, so she's exhausted. The boyfriend's behavior is disruptive: loud noises, physical movements. Even after she asks him to stop, the disturbances continue, leading to her not getting enough rest. People have different needs for sleep, and if someone is affecting another's ability to rest, it's a valid concern. Her being upfront about her needs is important for her well-being. The boyfriend might feel rejected, but her priority is her health and schedule. \n\nThe key points here are her communication of her needs and the boyfriend's reaction. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but the other issues (scratching, shaking, loud sounds) weren't addressed. She had to set a boundary, even if it upset him. It's about mutual respect and considering each other's needs. Since she apologized and showed love, maybe it's a matter of him needing to adjust his behavior for her comfort. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because she's not wrong for prioritizing her sleep and communicating that. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable, but her needs are valid.\n"
