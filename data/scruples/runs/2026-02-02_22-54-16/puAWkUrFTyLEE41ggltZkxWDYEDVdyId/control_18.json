Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. She's 23F, dating a 26M guy for a couple of weeks. They have good sex and he's a sweet guy. But last night, after a long day of work and coaching, she's exhausted and trying to sleep. He's making a lot of noise with his phone, loud burps, scratching, shaking the bed. She told him to turn off his phone, which he did, but then all night he kept disturbing her. She even threatened to murder him if he did it again. In the morning, she told him she can't sleep together anymore because of her schedule, and he almost cried. She feels bad but also needs her sleep.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether it's wrong for her to set this boundary. Let's break it down. She's communicated her needs clearly. She's exhausted from her work, which is legitimate. He's making repeated disturbances despite her request. She tried to address it during the night but it kept happening. Then she set a boundary in the morning. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, boundaries are important. If one partner is consistently affecting the other's well-being, it's reasonable to address it. Sleep is crucial, especially when someone has a demanding schedule. Her work and coaching are time-intensive, leading to fatigue. She's not rejecting him as a person but stating her need for rest. \n\nOn the other hand, her response was a bit harsh (\"murder him\"), but that's probably hyperbolic due to frustration. She did apologize and reassure him she loves him. He was upset, which is valid, but his actions led to her decision. \n\nHe might have a point if he felt rejected, but her primary need for sleep is understandable. It's possible they could find a compromise, like sleeping in separate rooms temporarily, but she made a firm decision. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Probably not. She's advocating for her health and well-being. Her actions were a consequence of repeated disturbances despite initial warnings. The boyfriend's behavior was the root cause. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
