Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 23-year-old woman, is in a new relationship with a 26-year-old man. She's been working a lot and is exhausted. Her boyfriend's nighttime habits\u2014like using his phone loudly, making noises, and shaking the bed\u2014are keeping her awake. She confronts him, he apologizes, but it continues. She ends up telling him she can't sleep with him again because she needs her rest, even though she loves him. He got upset, but she's standing her ground.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's wrong. Let's break it down. Her main issue is not being able to sleep because of his behaviors. She communicated her needs, he tried to adjust but didn't fully follow through. She then decided to sleep separately to preserve her health. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did tell him to stop, and he did initially, but the problem recurred. She's prioritizing her well-being, which is important. While it's early in the relationship, her health and need for sleep are valid. People have different sleeping habits, and if one person's habits consistently disrupt the other's rest, it's reasonable to seek a solution. \n\nBut is she in the wrong for not wanting to sleep in the same bed? Not necessarily. She's taking responsibility for her needs. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like using earplugs or sleeping in separate rooms temporarily. But given her exhaustion and the fact that he didn't fully address the issue, her decision makes sense. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of almost crying might indicate he felt rejected, but she's not being cruel\u2014she's explaining her need for sleep. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
