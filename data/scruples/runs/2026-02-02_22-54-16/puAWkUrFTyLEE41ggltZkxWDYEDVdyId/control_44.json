Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend. The situation involves some late-night disturbances from the boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the woman worked a long shift and coached, so she's exhausted. She's in bed trying to sleep but her boyfriend is being loud and disruptive\u2014watching videos, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. She asks him to turn it off, and he does, but then the disturbances continue all night. He keeps trying to cuddle her, which wakes her up. She eventually threatens him and the next morning tells him she can't do that again. He reacts emotionally, but she's firm on needing sleep.\n\nNow, considering the factors: she's exhausted, her job and schedule are demanding. The boyfriend's actions are clearly affecting her rest. She communicated her needs, and he tried to comply but still caused issues. She's setting a boundary to protect her health and well-being. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. She did tell him to stop, and he apologized but didn't stop. Her right to rest is important, especially if she's working long hours. Setting a boundary by not sleeping together is her way of enforcing that. The boyfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't mean she was wrong to prioritize her needs. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should have tried another approach first? Like sleeping in separate rooms without the confrontation? But given the situation, she did ask and he didn't help. Also, she mentions she still loves him, so it's not a malicious act. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people do have different sleeping habits, and sometimes couples need to adjust. But in this case, the disturbances were excessive and ongoing despite her request. It's reasonable for her to prioritize her health. The answer is likely B (not wrong).\n"
