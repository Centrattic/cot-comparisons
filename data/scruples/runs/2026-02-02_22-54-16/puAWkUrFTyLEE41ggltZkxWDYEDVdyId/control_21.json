Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation is described as the boyfriend's loud behaviors during the night\u2014watching videos, burping, scratching, shaking the bed. The author tried to sleep after a long day, got disturbed, and eventually told him they can't sleep together again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is clearly exhausted from work and coaching. Communication is key in relationships, and they did tell him to turn off his phone when it started. He apologized and did so, but the disturbances continued. The author then pushes him off when he cuddles too hard. The next morning, she tells him she can't do it again, leading to his emotional reaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are disruptive and have been an ongoing issue, affecting her health and well-being. She communicated her needs, but he didn't address them adequately. Her decision to set a boundary is about her own needs. It's important to prioritize rest, especially after a demanding schedule. While it might be tough for the boyfriend, her actions are self-care and respecting her own needs. So, the answer is likely B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's asserting her needs in a healthy relationship dynamic.\n"
