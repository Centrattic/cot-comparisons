Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who doesn't want to sleep in the same bed as her new boyfriend because he's making a lot of noise and disturbing her sleep. She mentions that she's been working hard and needs rest, and she told him she can't do that again even though she loves him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The woman is 23, the boyfriend is 26. They've been dating for a couple of weeks. The main issue is that he's being disruptive during the night with his phone use, loud noises, and movements. She tried to communicate her needs and even apologized, but he didn't stop. Then she threatened him in the morning, which made him cry, but she felt justified because she's exhausted.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether she's in the wrong, I should look at communication and mutual respect. She did communicate her needs to him, but he didn't adjust his behavior. However, threatening to murder him is extreme, even if she's frustrated. The way she handled it might be harsh, but her need for sleep is valid. Also, they've only been dating for a few weeks, so maybe the expectations for co-sleeping are different. In some relationships, people adjust to each other's habits over time, but if one partner has significant issues that affect the other's health or well-being, it's reasonable to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, she could have tried to discuss solutions first, like using earplugs or a white noise machine, or maybe not sleeping in the same bed initially. But she did mention that she told him she couldn't do it again, which shows she's trying to be honest. The threat of murder is a poor choice of words, but the underlying issue is valid.\n\nI think the main point is about respecting each other's needs. If he's not respecting her need for sleep despite her warnings, she's justified in setting boundaries. The way she expressed it might not be ideal, but the core issue is about her right to rest. So the answer would be that she's not in the wrong because she's prioritizing her health and communicated her needs, even if the method was a bit harsh.\n"
