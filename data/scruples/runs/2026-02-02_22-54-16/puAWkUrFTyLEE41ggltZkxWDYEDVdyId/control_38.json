Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 23-year-old woman, is in a new relationship with a 26-year-old man. They've been dating for a couple of weeks, and the sex is good. But the problem is that the boyfriend's nighttime behaviors are disturbing her sleep. She's very tired because she works and coaches, and he's being loud, scratching, burping, etc. She asked him to stop, he apologized, but the disturbances continued. She even threatened him in the morning, and he was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is about sleep and personal boundaries. The author is exhausted from her work schedule, which is legitimate. She tried to communicate her needs clearly, first by asking him to turn off his phone and later by telling him she can't handle it again. The boyfriend's actions (noises, shaking the bed) are affecting her ability to rest. She's justified in her frustration, especially since she's working long hours.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of the relationship being new. They've only been dating a few weeks. In new relationships, people are still learning each other's habits and boundaries. The author might be setting clear boundaries early on, which is important for a healthy relationship. However, her response was harsh\u2014threatening to murder him if he wakes her again. That's a strong statement and could be seen as overreacting, even if she's tired. The boyfriend was crying, which shows he was hurt by her words.\n\nOn the other hand, he did apologize after she asked him to stop, but the disturbances continued. So maybe he didn't take her request seriously enough. The author's need for sleep is valid. Long hours and coaching would take a toll, and not getting enough rest can affect her health and job performance. She's in her right to prioritize her well-being.\n\nBut the way she communicated her frustration\u2014threatening violence\u2014is problematic. Even if it's said in jest, it's not appropriate and could be scary for the other person. That might be where she's in the wrong. However, the underlying issue of not being able to sleep is a legitimate problem. It's possible she was stressed and overreacted, but her core issue is valid.\n\nSo balancing both sides: her need for sleep is real, and she's communicated it. His behavior is disruptive, and he should have respected her request more. But her threatening him is where she might be in the wrong. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong overall. Since the main issue is about sleep and boundaries, and her main action was setting a boundary (even if the wording was harsh), the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The threat is a misstep, but the core issue is about her right to rest. The boyfriend should have taken her requests more seriously from the start and adjusted his behavior to accommodate her needs. The author isn't wrong for standing up for her needs, even if her communication could have been better.\n"
