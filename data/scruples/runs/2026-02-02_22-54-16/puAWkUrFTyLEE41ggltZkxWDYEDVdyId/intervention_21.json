Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (23F) is with her boyfriend (26M) and after a long day, she's trying to sleep. He's making a lot of noise and disturbances, and she ends up telling him she can't sleep with him in the same bed again. She feels bad but is exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author had a tiring day and needed rest. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014loud phone, scratching, burping, shaking the bed\u2014is disruptive. She tried to communicate her needs, and when that didn't work, she set a boundary. The boyfriend was apologetic but maybe didn't adjust enough. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, her health and well-being are important. Sleep is crucial, and she's making a reasonable request. She even apologized later, so she's not being malicious. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt or rejected, but his actions were clearly affecting her.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The author is advocating for her needs, which is valid. The boyfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. The answer should be B (No), she's not in the wrong. The main issue is the boyfriend's behavior, not her response to it.\n"
