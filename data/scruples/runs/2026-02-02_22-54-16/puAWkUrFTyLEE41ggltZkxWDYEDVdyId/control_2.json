Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (23F) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to sleep in the same bed. The situation described involves her being extremely tired from work and coaching, and her boyfriend's disruptive behaviors during the night. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author worked a long shift and was exhausted. She asked her boyfriend to stop the disruptive behaviors, which he apologized for but didn't fully stop. She ended up getting very little sleep, which led to her making a harsh comment in the morning before apologizing.\n\nOn the other side, the boyfriend seems to be trying to apologize and make amends. He was sorry when she first complained, turned off his phone, but then continued to disturb her sleep. The fact that he almost cried in the morning might indicate he felt hurt by her comment or the situation.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author communicated her needs, which is important in any relationship. However, her response was extreme (\"if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him\") and she ended up sleeping separately. The question is whether her reaction was justified given the circumstances.\n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, it's common to encourage partners to communicate their needs clearly. If someone is significantly impacting another's health and well-being (like sleep), it's reasonable to set boundaries. However, the way she communicated might be seen as harsh, but given the exhaustion, it's understandable. The boyfriend's continued disruption despite her request is a problem too.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and setting boundaries. The boyfriend might need to adjust his behavior, but the author's actions are a response to his failure to respect her needs. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
