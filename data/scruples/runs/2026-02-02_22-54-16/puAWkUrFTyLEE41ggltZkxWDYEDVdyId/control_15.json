Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old woman who's been dating a guy for a few weeks. She's been working long hours and coaching soccer, and when she's trying to sleep, her boyfriend is making a lot of noise, shaking the bed, and being disruptive. She tells him to stop, but he keeps doing it all night. She eventually tells him if he wakes her up again, she'll kill him. In the morning, she apologizes but says she can't do that again because she needs sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the woman) is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe woman worked a 9-hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours. That's a lot of physical and mental exertion. She needs rest. Her boyfriend is being disruptive by watching videos loudly, burping, scratching, shaking the bed, etc. She politely asks him to turn off his phone and he does, but then continues to disturb her. She's exhausted and can't sleep properly. The next morning, she tells him she can't do that again and that her schedule is hectic. He almost cries, and she feels bad but is still tired.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The woman communicated her needs clearly\u2014she told him to turn off the phone and he did, but the other disturbances continued. She's being honest about her limits, especially regarding her health and work schedule. It's reasonable for someone in her position to prioritize their rest, especially when their job and responsibilities are important. The boyfriend's actions are affecting her well-being. She's not being cruel; she's setting boundaries. The fact that she apologized and said she still loves him shows she's considerate of his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend didn't realize how disruptive his actions were. But the woman did ask him to stop, and he didn't follow through. She's in a position where she needs to protect her sleep because of her work schedule. It's not just about being tired; it's about maintaining her health and ability to function. The threat of murder is extreme, but it's a hyperbolic expression of frustration, not a literal threat. The morning after, she handled it maturely by apologizing and explaining her reasons.\n\nSo, considering all this, the woman is taking steps to protect her health and set boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her needs, especially when she's communicated them. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
