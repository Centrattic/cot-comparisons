Sex is really good. But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I\u2019m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he\u2019d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I\u2019d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I\u2019d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can\u2019t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I\u2019m tired???? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman (23F) who's been dating a guy (26M) for a few weeks. They have good sex and he's sweet, but last night was really disruptive. She was exhausted after work and soccer coaching, and he was making a lot of noise and movements during the night, keeping her awake. She told him to turn his phone off, he did, but the disturbances continued. She ended up telling him she can't sleep with him again because she needs rest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From her perspective, she's clearly exhausted and her job requires a lot. The guy's behavior was disruptive\u2014scratching, burping, loud noises, bed shaking. Even after she asked him to stop, he didn't manage to keep things quiet. She communicated her needs, which is important. She also mentioned she still loves him but can't handle this situation. She felt bad when he cried, but her health and rest are priorities.\n\nOn his side, he might be unaware of how his actions affect her. He apologized when she first asked him to turn off his phone. Maybe he's not a bad person, but perhaps he has habits he's not conscious of. The fact that he almost cried shows he felt rejected or hurt. But the problem is that her needs for rest are valid, especially with her busy schedule.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She clearly communicated her problem and tried to address it. If the issue persists even after he tried to comply, it's reasonable for her to take a step back. Sleep is crucial for health and well-being, so her decision to not sleep in the same bed again isn't unreasonable. The fact that they're only a few weeks into the relationship also matters. It's early enough that they're still figuring out each other's needs and boundaries. She's in a right to prioritize her health. The guy might need to adjust his behavior, but if it's beyond his control (like sleep issues), they'd need to find another solution. But in this case, she's making a choice that's best for herself. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in setting boundaries for her well-being. The guy might need to work on his habits or they might need to find a compromise, but she's not at fault for standing up for her needs here.\n"
