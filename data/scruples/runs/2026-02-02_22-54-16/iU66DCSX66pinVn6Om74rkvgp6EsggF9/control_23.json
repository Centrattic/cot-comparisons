A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author lied to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore after an initial conflict. Then, when his wife found out he was still in contact, she got mad. The author is asking if he's the one at fault here.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz, but he actually continued to be friends. Then, when his wife discovered this through checking his phone, he's questioning her actions and his own.\n\nFrom the start, the author had a problem where his wife didn't trust him because of a misunderstanding from texts with Liz. He tried to appease her by saying he'd stop being friends with Liz, but he didn't actually do it. That's a lie. So lying to a spouse about something important, especially related to trust, is a big deal. Even if the original conflict was about Liz's texts, the author's choice to lie about cutting off communication could be seen as a betrayal of trust.\n\nThen, when his wife found out by checking his phone, he's upset about that. But she did it because she was angry about the lie. The question is whether her method is justified. While checking someone's phone is an invasion of privacy, the author's lie might have contributed to her needing to do that to get the truth.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The author prioritized appeasing his wife with a lie rather than addressing the real issue. By not being honest, he set up a situation where his wife felt the need to check his phone to find out the truth. So the lie led to the conflict. Even if the wife's method was wrong, the author's dishonesty is the root problem here.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that his wife does get moody around that time of the month, but that's probably not a valid excuse for her actions. However, the author's decision to lie is still his responsibility. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he lied and broke trust, which led to the conflict.\n"
