A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a coworker named Liz who started dating another girl. The author and Liz were talking about this relationship, and during the conversation, the author gave some advice that Liz might be in a bad relationship. He relayed this to his wife, but she misunderstood, thinking Liz was interested in him. The wife then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author agreed not to, but secretly continued the friendship. When the wife found out later, she was angry because he lied. Now, the author is questioning if he was wrong for not telling her the truth.\n\nSo, the key points are: the wife's jealousy led her to forbid contact with Liz, but the author kept in touch anyway. He lied about cutting off the friendship. The wife went through his phone to find out. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. Even if the wife was acting out of jealousy or moodiness (as the author mentions it's \"that time of the month\"), her initial request was based on a misunderstanding. However, if the author agreed to stop the friendship but didn't follow through, that's a breach of trust. The wife might feel betrayed, especially if she was hurting from the misunderstanding. The author's decision to continue the friendship and lie about it could be seen as deceitful, even if the original request was unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions of going through his phone are also problematic. Privacy is important in a relationship, and her action could be seen as invasive. But the author's dishonesty is also an issue. If he had honest communication with her, maybe they could have resolved the misunderstanding earlier. However, the author might argue that his wife's initial reaction was irrational, and he was trying to comply but then couldn't because of work circumstances. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the act of lying is generally considered wrong in a relationship. The author chose to deceive his wife despite her explicit request, which could lead to further trust issues. Even if the wife's actions were over the top, the author's response was to hide the truth instead of addressing the issue openly. So, even though the wife's actions were also questionable, the author's deceit is a significant factor here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about continuing the friendship with Liz.\n"
