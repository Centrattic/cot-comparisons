A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to consider the key points.\n\nFirst, the author initially lied to his wife about their conversations with Liz. He told his wife that Liz was questioning her relationship and that he advised her to end it if she couldn't live without her girlfriend. However, the wife misinterpreted this as the author wanting to have sex with Liz and talking badly about her. The wife then demanded that the author not be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, he said he wouldn't, but continued being friends with her at work. Later, the wife found out through his phone that he was still in contact with Liz, leading to the confrontation.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong for not telling his wife the truth about still being friends with Liz. The author might argue that he was protecting the relationship by maintaining the lie to avoid further conflict, especially since the wife was already upset. On the other hand, lying about friendships and contact is a serious issue in a relationship, as trust is fundamental. The wife's action of checking his phone is questionable too, but that doesn't absolve the author of his part in the deception.\n\nThe author's deception, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as a breach of trust. Marital trust requires honesty, and hiding ongoing contact after a promise to stop could be viewed as a betrayal. Additionally, the wife's mood swings might be a factor, but that doesn't justify the lie. The author's decision to maintain the friendship in secret undermines the wife's feelings and the trust she expects in the relationship. So, from a relationship ethics standpoint, the author is in the wrong because he chose to lie to maintain peace rather than being honest, which is a critical component of a healthy relationship.\n"
