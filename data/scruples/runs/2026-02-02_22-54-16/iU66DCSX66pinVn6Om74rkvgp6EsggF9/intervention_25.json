A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with Liz where he gave relationship advice. His wife misunderstood the conversation, thinking he was expressing interest in Liz. She then forbade him from being friends with Liz. He complied by saying he wouldn't, but they still communicated at work. Later, the wife found out he was still texting Liz, leading to confrontation.\n\nSo, the main issue is the lie. The author didn't actually stop being friends with Liz; he just stopped communicating outside of work. But he told his wife he wasn't friends anymore. Is that a lie? It depends on how \"friends\" is defined. If \"friends\" means just the work relationship, then maybe not a lie. But if \"friends\" implies more than just work interactions, then he withheld the truth.\n\nAlso, the wife went through his phone, which is generally considered a breach of privacy. However, the author did lie, which complicates things. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but we need to assess both sides.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The author lied about the nature of his relationship with Liz. Even if they were only work friends, he didn't disclose that he was still communicating with her. 2) The wife's actions (checking the phone) are problematic, but the author's dishonesty also contributes to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties have issues. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he intentionally misled his wife, even if it was to keep the peace, that's a lie. Lies are generally considered wrong, so the answer might lean towards A. However, some might argue the lie was a small one to avoid conflict, making the wife more at fault. But in relationships, honesty is crucial. Even white lies can erode trust. The author's lie, though perhaps well-intentioned, was deceitful. On the other hand, the wife's invasion of privacy is also a serious issue. But the initial question is about the author's wrongdoing. Given that, the author did lie, so he's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
