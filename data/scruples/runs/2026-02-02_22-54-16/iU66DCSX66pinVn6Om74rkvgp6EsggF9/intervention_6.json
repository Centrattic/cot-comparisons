A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation started when the author was confiding in his wife about Liz's texts. The wife misunderstood the conversation, thinking the author was flirting with Liz and talking badly about her. This led her to demand that he stop being friends with Liz. He agreed but continued the friendship in secret.\n\nNow, the wife found out he was still texting Liz. The author didn't lie about the content of the texts but didn't correct her assumption that Liz wanted to have sex with him. Wait, actually, the author said he tried to convince her otherwise but she didn't believe him. So maybe the initial problem was the wife's misunderstanding, which the author tried to address but she didn't accept. Then he lied about ending the friendship, which is the current issue.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not telling the truth about still being friends with Liz. On one hand, he was following his wife's request, even if it was based on a misunderstanding. On the other hand, lying about maintaining contact could be seen as dishonest. However, the wife herself went through his phone, which is a privacy violation. The author's lie might be a response to her unreasonable demand, which she later acted on in a harsh way (checking his phone). \n\nSo, the author's actions involve both lying and keeping a secret, but the wife's actions include making an unreasonable demand and invading privacy. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, considering the wife's mood swings and the initial misunderstanding. The key points are mutual fault: the author lied, but the wife's actions also contributed. However, the question is specifically about the author's fault. Since the author didn't correct the misunderstanding, maybe he should have been more open. But the lie was to appease his wife, which complicates it. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, lying is often seen as wrong, but context matters. If the wife's demand was based on a misunderstanding, the author might have been trying to preserve the relationship. However, lying about the friendship is still a breach of trust. The wife's checking the phone is also a big issue. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So, even if the wife is at fault, the author's lie is still a problem. Therefore, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he lied, regardless of the circumstances. Alternatively, if the wife's demand was unreasonable and her actions were the bigger issue, then B (not in the wrong). But in AITA, lying is usually grounds for being in the wrong unless there's a really strong justification. The author's lie was to avoid conflict, which isn't a strong enough reason. So probably answer A.\n"
