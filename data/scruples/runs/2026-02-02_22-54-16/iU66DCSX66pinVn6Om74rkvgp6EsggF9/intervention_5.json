A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The main issue is about lying to his wife about still texting Liz after promising not to. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a situation where his wife was upset because Liz mentioned not wanting to be without her girlfriend. The author tried to explain that Liz was actually questioning the relationship, but the wife misunderstood. The author tried to appease her by saying they wouldn't be friends, but continued the friendship secretly. Now the wife found out and is upset because he lied.\n\nSo, the key points are: did the author lie? Yes, he told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore but continued texting her. That's a lie. But why? He did it to avoid conflict, thinking the wife might be moody. However, lying is generally a problem in relationships. The wife's reaction is about betrayal, which is a significant issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife went through his phone, which is invasive and not okay. But the author's actions of lying started the problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the lie. Even though the wife invaded privacy, the initial lie is on the author. \n\nAlso, the author didn't delete the texts or hide the contact; he just didn't inform his wife. That's a lie of omission. The wife's action is wrong, but the author's dishonesty is the root. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Lying, even to prevent conflict, can damage trust. So while the wife's actions are also problematic, the author's lie is a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
