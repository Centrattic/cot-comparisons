A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation started when the author was talking to his wife about Liz's situation. He shared a text from Liz where she mentions not having sex with a guy in two years and considering ending the relationship. The author then gave advice, which his wife misinterpreted. She thought he was flirting or being inappropriate with Liz, leading her to demand he stop being friends. He agreed but continued the friendship secretly.\n\nNow, the wife found out he's still in contact with Liz by checking his phone. The author didn't explicitly lie about the friendship itself but said he wouldn't be friends anymore, which he technically avoided by staying in touch. The key point here is whether the author's actions constitute a lie. If he promised not to be friends and still maintained contact, that's a lie of omission or a direct lie if he said he wasn't friends but was.\n\nHowever, the wife's actions of checking his phone without permission might be seen as overstepping. The author's secrecy could be seen as a lack of transparency, which might be his fault. But if he made a specific promise not to be friends and then broke it, that's a lie. On the other hand, if he never explicitly agreed not to communicate at all, maybe he's in the right. But given that he said he wouldn't be friends and then continued to text, it's a lie. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
