A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with his wife about his colleague Liz, where Liz mentioned she might not want to be in a relationship anymore. The author advised Liz, which led his wife to misunderstand, thinking he was encouraging Liz to pursue her. The wife then made him promise not to be friends with Liz. However, he continued the friendship secretly.\n\nNow, the key points. The wife asked him not to be friends with Liz, and he lied about it. That's a breach of trust. Even if the wife was acting out of jealousy or misunderstanding, the author chose to deceive her. The wife then found out by checking his phone, which is a privacy issue on her part. But the author didn't tell the truth when he could have. He could have explained the situation again, but instead, he lied. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Lying to a spouse, especially about something the spouse explicitly asked about, is generally considered wrong. The wife's actions (checking the phone) are also problematic, but the author's dishonesty is the main issue here. Even if the wife's reasoning was flawed, the author should have been honest. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he lied to his wife despite her clear request, which undermines trust in the relationship.\n"
