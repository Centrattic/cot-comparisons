A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The situation started with the author sharing a conversation with Liz, which his wife misinterpreted. The wife got upset, told him not to be friends with Liz, and he agreed not to. But he kept texting her, and the wife found out.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author lied about not being friends with Liz. He said he wouldn't be friends but continued to text her. Even if it's a workplace relationship, he made a promise to his wife and broke it. Lying is generally considered wrong in relationships because it breaches trust. The wife's actions of checking his phone are questionable too, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The wife might be in the wrong for invading his privacy, but the author lied. So he broke a commitment. Even if the wife is being unreasonable, he should have been honest. Maybe he could have talked to her again instead of lying. So, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he lied and broke his promise.\n"
