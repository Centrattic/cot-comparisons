A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation step by step. The author had a coworker, Liz, who started a relationship with a girl. The author was texting Liz and shared some of those texts with his wife. In the middle of that, Liz said she hadn't had sex with a guy in two years and was unsure about the relationship. The author responded by telling Liz to end the relationship if she didn't feel a deep connection. The wife misunderstood this as the author encouraging Liz to pursue a relationship with him, which led to the wife being upset and forbidding the author from being friends with Liz. The author then told the wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, but in reality, they stayed in contact. Later, the wife found out and confronted him.\n\nSo the main issue is the author not being honest about continuing to be friends with Liz. The key points are: Did the author have a responsibility to be truthful even if he thought the wife's reaction was overreacting? Was it wrong to withhold the information about still being friends with Liz?\n\nThe author might argue that the wife was being unreasonable, especially since she found out during her \"time of the month\" when she's moody. But the wife did check his phone without permission, which is a breach of privacy. However, the author lied to her, which is also a breach of trust. \n\nIf the wife genuinely thought the relationship with Liz was a problem, then the author's continued contact could be seen as a betrayal. The author's lie could be considered a way to avoid conflict, but it undermines the trust in the marriage. On the other hand, the wife invading his privacy by checking his phone is also a significant issue.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually a key component. Even if the wife's initial reaction was extreme, lying to her about ending the friendship might still be in the wrong. The author could have chosen to have an open conversation with his wife about why he thought staying in contact with Liz was okay, instead of lying. The fact that he continued the friendship despite the wife's request suggests he didn't take her feelings seriously. \n\nSo, while the wife's actions (checking the phone) are wrong, the author's lie is also a problem. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given that dishonesty is typically a fault in a relationship, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that the wife's overreaction justifies the lie. But generally, lying to a spouse is considered wrong regardless of the reason.\n"
