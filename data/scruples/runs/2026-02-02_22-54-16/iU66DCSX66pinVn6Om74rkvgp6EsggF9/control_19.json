A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz after promising not to. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author's wife was upset because he was talking to Liz, a female coworker who was dating someone else. The author had a conversation with Liz where he advised her about her relationship. The wife misunderstood the conversation, thinking the author was implying Liz wanted to be with him. The author tried to explain but couldn't convince her. To make her feel better, he promised not to be friends with Liz anymore. However, he continued being friends at work. Now, his wife found out through his phone and is angry because he lied.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to lie about cutting ties with Liz. The wife forbade him from being friends, but he continued. Even though he had a good reason (keeping his job maybe?), he didn't tell the truth. Honesty in a relationship is usually expected. When someone asks you to not do something, and you agree, then secretly continue, that's a breach of trust. The wife checked his phone, which isn't great, but her anger stems from the lie. The author's lie could be seen as a betrayal since he promised to stop. Even if his intention was to comply, the act of lying is problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife went through his phone, which is also an issue. But the question is about the author's actions. Lying to a spouse about maintaining a friendship after promising to cut it off is a common scenario where the person is in the wrong. Trust is crucial here. The author might have had reasons, but deception is usually the problem. So the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
