A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore, even though they stayed friends at work. The wife found out he was still texting Liz and is upset. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was friends with Liz, a female coworker. When Liz started a relationship and then broke up due to her girlfriend's lies, she vented to the author. The author shared some of Liz's texts with his wife, which led to a misunderstanding. The wife believed Liz was interested in the author and that he was badmouthing her. The author agreed to stop being friends with Liz to appease his wife but continued the friendship secretly. Now the wife found out through her phone check.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not telling his wife the truth about still being friends with Liz. The user says the author isn't wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author lied to his wife. He told her he wasn't friends with Liz anymore but continued to text her. That's a lie by omission or active deception. Lying is generally considered wrong in a relationship, especially if it's about something the partner cares about. The wife felt betrayed and invaded her privacy by checking his phone, which is also problematic, but that's her action.\n\nThe author tried to explain the situation, but the wife misunderstood and was hurt. Even if the author had good intentions (maintaining a work relationship), not being honest is a breach of trust. Trust is crucial in marriages, and lying, even to avoid conflict, can damage that trust. The author chose to deceive his wife instead of addressing the misunderstanding. Maybe he should have clarified the situation with his wife rather than lying.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's method of checking the phone is invasive. However, the author's deception is the root cause here. He didn't communicate openly, leading to a breakdown in trust. His actions could be seen as dishonest, which would make him at least partially in the wrong. The wife's actions are also wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author did lie about continuing the friendship, which is a significant issue. Even if the wife's approach was wrong, the author's deception is a problem. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife.\n"
