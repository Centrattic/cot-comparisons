A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author lied to his wife about not being friends with a coworker named Liz after an argument. The wife discovered the lie by going through his phone. Now, the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author initially told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her, but continued the friendship secretly. Lying is a big issue in relationships. Trust is crucial, and breaking that trust by lying, even if the reason is to avoid conflict, can be problematic. \n\nThen, the wife went through his phone. That's also an invasion of privacy, which is generally considered wrong. However, the wife's actions might be a reaction to the author's initial lie. If the author had been honest from the start, maybe the wife wouldn't have felt the need to check his phone. \n\nThe author argues that the wife is being unreasonable, especially mentioning it's \"that time of the month,\" which could imply her anger is hormonal. But using that as an excuse might not be fair. People are responsible for their actions regardless of their mood. \n\nThe wife's decision to check his phone is a breach of privacy, but it's often a response to a loss of trust. If the author lied, he's the one who initiated the breach of trust. The wife's action, while wrong, might be a consequence of the author's dishonesty. \n\nSo, the main question is: who is more at fault? The author lied, which is a significant issue in a relationship. The wife invaded his privacy, which is also wrong. However, the root cause is the author's lie. Without the lie, the wife might not have resorted to checking his phone. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for lying and not maintaining trust, even if the wife's response was also inappropriate. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is typically prioritized over privacy. The author's choice to lie, even to avoid conflict, led to further issues. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
