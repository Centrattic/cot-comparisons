A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation to understand it better.\n\nFirst, the author is a husband who had a conversation with his wife about a female coworker named Liz. Liz was dating someone who lied and did shady things. The author was texting Liz and shared her messages with his wife. In one of those texts, Liz mentioned not having sex with a guy in two years and questioning her relationship. The author responded by advising Liz to end the relationship if she didn't feel connected to her girlfriend. However, the wife misunderstood this as the author implying that Liz wanted to have sex with him and that he was talking bad about the wife. This led to the wife cutting off the author's friendship with Liz, but the author didn't actually stop being friends with Liz at work. Now, the wife discovered the ongoing texts, and the author is asking if he's wrong for lying about ending the friendship or if the wife is the problem for checking his phone.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author lied to his wife about ending the friendship, even though they still interacted at work. The wife then found out by checking his phone. The author is trying to decide if he's at fault for the lie or if the wife is the one in the wrong for snooping.\n\nLooking at the situation, the author explicitly told his wife he would stop being friends with Liz to appease her, but he didn't follow through. That's a lie by omission or a direct lie. The wife, on the other hand, went through his phone, which is generally considered a privacy violation. However, the author's deception likely contributed to her need to check the phone in the first place. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, lying to a spouse is typically seen as a breach of trust, especially when the spouse has a legitimate concern. The wife's action of checking the phone is wrong, but the author's lie might have been the catalyst. The question is whether the author is more in the wrong for lying, despite the wife's transgression.\n\nIn many relationships, honesty is fundamental. Even if the wife's method of finding out was wrong, the author's dishonesty is a serious issue. The fact that he continued the friendship despite promising his wife he wouldn't is a key point. So while the wife's actions are not justified, the author's lie is a significant problem. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
