A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author initially told his wife that Liz was considering breaking up her relationship because she didn't feel the same connection as before. The wife misunderstood this as the author encouraging Liz to be with him instead, leading to her being upset and telling him to stop being friends with Liz. The author then agreed not to be friends, but in reality, they kept in touch at work. Now, the wife found out and is angry, so the author is wondering if he was wrong to lie.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the original conversation and the subsequent lie. The author's wife took his words the wrong way, which is a problem. But when he told her he would stop being friends with Liz, he didn't actually do that. That's the lie. Even if they were just coworkers, the author said he wouldn't be friends anymore but continued to be. Lying about cutting off contact could be an issue, especially if the wife was genuinely upset and needed trust.\n\nThe wife checking his phone is definitely a problem. Privacy is important, and she shouldn't have done that. But does that excuse the author's lie? Maybe not. Trust in a relationship is fundamental. If the wife had a legitimate concern and the author made a promise he didn't keep, that's a breach of trust. The fact that they were still friends at work might not matter if the wife wanted no contact. The author might have thought it was harmless, but the lie itself could erode trust. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he lied about something that was important to his wife. Even if the wife overreacted, the author should have been honest. The wife's action of checking his phone is not justified, but the lie is on the author's part. So the answer should be A.\n"
