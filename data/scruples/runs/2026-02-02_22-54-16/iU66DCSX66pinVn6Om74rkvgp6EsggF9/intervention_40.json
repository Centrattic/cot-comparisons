A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves lying to their wife about ending a friendship with a coworker named Liz. The author initially told their wife they wouldn't be friends anymore to appease her, but continued texting Liz at work. The wife later found out by checking the phone and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author didn't lie about the content of the texts with Liz initially; they misrepresented their own actions by saying they stopped being friends. The wife felt betrayed because she believed the author had cut ties. The author's justification is that they were trying to maintain peace, and the wife's anger is partly due to her PMS. \n\nNow, considering the moral aspect. Honesty in a relationship is crucial. Even if it's a small lie, like saying they aren't friends anymore when they are, it can erode trust. The wife has a right to know about the continued contact, especially if she had asked to stop. The author might have thought it harmless, but the lie is about their actions, which directly affects the wife's trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife going through the phone is also an issue. Privacy is important, and that action could be seen as wrong. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not the wife. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's lie is justified. Even if the wife's behavior was moody, the author chose to lie. Lies, even if well-intentioned, can lead to bigger problems. The author didn't have to actually end the friendship but should have been truthful about continuing it. The wife's reaction is understandable because she felt deceived. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a promise to stop the friendship but continued it and lied about it. The wife's actions are separate, but the focus here is on the author's dishonesty.\n"
