A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying about still being friends with Liz after promising their wife they wouldn't. \n\nFirst, the situation started with the author sharing texts from Liz with their wife. The wife misunderstood the conversation, thinking the author was implying Liz wanted to be with him. The wife then demanded that the author stop being friends with Liz. The author agreed but secretly continued the friendship. Now the wife found out and is upset.\n\nThe key points here are the initial lie and the breach of trust. The author made a promise to their wife not to be friends with Liz, which they broke. Even if the wife was being unreasonable or had her own issues (like her \"time of the month\"), the author's decision to continue texting Liz without disclosure could be seen as dishonest. Relationships require trust, and breaking a promise\u2014even if the reason is to avoid conflict\u2014can be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction included going through the phone, which is a privacy invasion. The author might argue that they were protecting their friendship or that the wife overreacted. However, lying to a spouse is generally frowned upon because it undermines trust. The author's secrecy could be justified as preserving a work relationship, but the act of lying remains. \n\nSo, while the wife's methods (checking the phone) are also questionable, the author's dishonesty about the friendship is a valid point against them. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
