A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a coworker, Liz, who was dating someone. Liz confided in the author via text, and the author shared some of Liz's texts with his wife. The wife misunderstood what was said, leading her to want the author to stop being friends with Liz. The author agreed to stop, but in reality, they stayed friends at work. Later, the wife found out he was still texting Liz and is upset. The author is now lying again about not being friends with Liz.\n\nSo, the key points here are about honesty in the relationship. The author made a promise to his wife not to be friends with Liz anymore but continued the friendship. Even if the wife might have overreacted before, the author didn't tell the truth about their ongoing communication. \n\nHonesty is usually a big factor in relationships. Even if there's a history of misunderstandings or the wife's mood issues, the author chose to lie again. The wife's actions of checking his phone are problematic too, but the question is about the author's responsibility. \n\nThe author's defense is that the wife was being unreasonable at the time, but that doesn't justify lying. If the author felt the promise couldn't be kept, he should have communicated that honestly. Lying to avoid conflict, even if the wife's behavior is questionable, still creates a problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he broke the promise and lied about his friendship with Liz.\n"
