A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with his wife about a coworker, Liz, who was going through a breakup. During that conversation, he included a private text where Liz seemed uncertain about her relationship. The wife misinterpreted the conversation, thinking the author was implying he wanted to have sex with Liz and was talking badly about her. This led to the wife forbidding him from being friends with Liz. To appease her, he agreed not to be friends but continued to be friends at work. Now, the wife found out about the continued texts and is upset. The author is questioning if he's in the wrong for not telling the truth about still being friends, or if the wife is the problem for invading his privacy.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception and privacy. The author lied about not being friends with Liz after promising his wife he wouldn't. That's a breach of trust. Even if the wife's actions (checking his phone) were wrong, the author's lie is a separate issue. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and lying about maintaining contact with someone the wife was already suspicious of could be seen as dishonest. The fact that he continued the friendship despite agreeing not to is a problem. The wife's method of finding out is questionable, but that doesn't absolve him of the lie. So, the author is in the wrong because he broke his promise and lied to his wife. The answer should be A.\n"
