A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the author had a female coworker named Liz who started dating another girl. The author was texting Liz and discussed their marriage, which led to the wife getting upset. The wife thought Liz was trying to get close to the husband and that he was badmouthing her. The wife then told the husband not to be friends with Liz anymore. The husband agreed not to, but in reality, they stayed friends. Later, the wife found out and is angry, leading to the question of who is at fault.\n\nSo the key points here are: the husband lied about ending the friendship with Liz, and the wife discovered it by checking his phone. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for the lie, or if the wife is the one at fault for snooping.\n\nThe husband initially told his wife he would stop being friends with Liz to avoid conflict, but continued the friendship secretly. This is a lie, and lying in a relationship is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if the husband thought he was protecting his wife's feelings, the lie undermines trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions of checking his phone without permission are also problematic. She violated his privacy, which is not acceptable. However, her actions might stem from her initial anger and mistrust caused by the husband's initial conversation with Liz and his subsequent lie.\n\nThe situation is complex. The husband's lie is a significant issue because he made a promise to his wife and then broke it. Even if he thought he was justified, lying is a common point of contention in relationships. The wife's snooping is also wrong, but her actions were a response to the husband's deceit. However, it's important to note that both actions are problematic, but the husband's lie might be the primary issue here because he initiated the dishonesty.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband made a deliberate choice to lie, which is a direct violation of trust. The wife's snooping is a reaction, but not the root cause. Therefore, the author (the husband) is more at fault here for the lie, even though the wife's actions are also wrong. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
