A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The situation involves a female coworker, Liz, who came out as a lesbian and then had relationship issues. The author shared some of Liz's private texts with his wife, which led to a misunderstanding. The wife became upset and told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. He agreed but continued the friendship secretly. Now, the wife found out and is angry, so he's wondering if he did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author was reading Liz's private messages to his wife. Even if he had good intentions, sharing someone else's private conversations without consent is a breach of privacy. That's a big issue. Then, when he told his wife he wasn't friends with Liz anymore, he was lying. Lying is generally considered wrong, especially in a relationship where trust is crucial.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife went through his phone, which is also a violation of privacy. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying. The fact that he continued the friendship after making a promise to stop suggests that he was dishonest. Even if the wife's actions (checking the phone) were wrong, the author's lie still stands. \n\nThe author might have thought he was protecting the relationship by not telling his wife, but secrecy and lying can erode trust. The initial act of sharing Liz's private messages without her knowledge might have already caused harm, and then lying about the friendship adds to that. \n\nThe wife's anger is likely due to feeling betrayed after he lied. Even if she checked his phone, the main issue is his dishonesty. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he lied about his friendship with Liz, which is a breach of trust, regardless of the wife's actions.\n"
