A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the initial problem started when the author told his wife about Liz's texts, which led to the wife misunderstanding the conversation as the author wanting to have sex with Liz. The wife then forbade him from being friends with Liz, but he didn't actually stop being friends at work. He told her he wouldn't, but continued texting. Now the wife found out and is angry.\n\nSo, the author lied by omission. He said he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, but he kept texting her. Even if he thought it was to appease his wife, he made a promise he didn't keep. The wife's anger is justified because he lied. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife did go through his phone, which is a privacy issue. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is his dishonesty. Even if the wife's actions (checking the phone) were wrong, the author's initial lie is the root of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, trust is key. Lying, even if to avoid conflict, breaks that trust. The author should have been honest about continuing the friendship if he felt it was important, but instead he made a false promise. So he's in the wrong here.\n"
