A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who lied to his wife about not being friends with a female coworker, Liz. The wife found out he was still texting her and is upset.\n\nFirst, the author's wife was already upset about the initial conversation where he discussed Liz's relationship issues. He tried to appease her by saying he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, but he continued texting her at work. The key point is whether lying to his wife about ending the friendship is wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't at fault, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, honesty is usually valued. Even if the wife acted inconsiderately (like checking his phone), the author still lied about cutting off communication with Liz. He made a promise to his wife and broke it, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, the wife's actions of checking his phone without permission are also problematic. Her behavior might be a provocation, but that doesn't excuse the author's lie. The situation is complex because both parties acted in ways that could be seen as wrong. But the central issue here is the lie. If the wife had trusted him and he respected her feelings by being honest, maybe the situation could have been avoided. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is overreacting (as she might be during her period), the author might feel he's in the right to maintain his friendships. However, the decision to lie rather than have an open conversation could be the root of the problem. \n\nIn many cases, lying in a relationship is considered a significant issue, even if the other party is acting unreasonably. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being truthful, even if the wife's methods were inappropriate.\n"
