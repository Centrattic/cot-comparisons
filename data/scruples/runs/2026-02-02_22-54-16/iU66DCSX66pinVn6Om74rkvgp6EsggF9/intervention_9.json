A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who lied to his wife about not being friends with a female coworker, Liz. The wife found out he was still texting her, so she went through his phone.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: He told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz to make her feel better after a conflict. But in reality, they stayed friends at work. When his wife found out, she was angry. The author is asking if he's at fault for not telling her he was still in contact with Liz, or if the wife is wrong for checking his phone.\n\nI need to break this down. The key points are the initial lie and the wife's response. The author says he lied to appease his wife, but then continued the friendship. Lying in a relationship is often a red flag. Even if the intention was to keep the peace, not being honest can erode trust. The wife's reaction, while maybe not the best (checking his phone), was a response to feeling betrayed. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, keeping a secret about a friendship that you promised to end could be seen as dishonest. The wife might feel that the author didn't respect her wishes or his word. On the other hand, she went through his phone without permission, which is also a breach of trust. However, lying is generally considered a bigger issue because it's a choice made by the person, whereas the wife's action, while wrong, might be a reaction to feeling insecure.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he made a promise and broke it, that's on him. Even if his intention was to keep the peace, the lie itself is problematic. Relationships require honesty, and the author's choice to lie, even if for a good reason, put the relationship at risk. So the answer might be that he is in the wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe there's nuance. The author said he tried to convince his wife otherwise when she misunderstood the conversation with Liz. The initial issue was a misunderstanding, and he tried to correct it. However, when he lied about the friendship, that's where the problem escalated. The key point is the ongoing deceit. Even if the wife's method of finding out was wrong, the author's lie was the root issue. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
