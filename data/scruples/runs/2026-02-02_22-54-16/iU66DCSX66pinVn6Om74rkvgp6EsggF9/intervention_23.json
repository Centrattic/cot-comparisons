A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's wife found out he was still friends with Liz after he promised not to be. He didn't tell her because he wanted to appease her when she was upset about the previous texts. But he maintained the friendship secretly.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The author did lie about his friendship with Liz, which is a breach of trust. However, the wife initially reacted strongly, even going through his phone. Her actions might be seen as invasive, but the author's lie is also problematic because he didn't communicate honestly.\n\nLying in a relationship usually damages trust. Even if the wife was acting out of jealousy, the author's decision to keep the friendship hidden instead of addressing her concerns openly could be seen as his fault. He should have been honest about maintaining the friendship, even if it upset her. \n\nSo, while the wife's actions of checking the phone are questionable, the author's lie is a significant issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because maintaining trust is crucial in a relationship, and deception, even for appeasement, isn't justified.\n"
