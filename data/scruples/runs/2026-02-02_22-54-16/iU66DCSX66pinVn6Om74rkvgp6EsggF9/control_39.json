A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who lied to his wife about not being friends with a female coworker (Liz) after the wife got upset about the texts. The husband continued to be friends with Liz at work despite promising his wife he wouldn't. Then, when the wife found out by checking his phone, he's wondering if he's the asshole or if she is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband initially had a conversation with Liz, which he relayed to his wife. During that conversation, the husband might have made comments that his wife misinterpreted, leading to her being upset. He promised to stop being friends with Liz to appease her, but he didn't actually do it, maintaining a work relationship. The wife then discovered this through checking his phone.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the husband's decision to lie about cutting ties with Liz. Even though he might have thought it was to maintain peace, keeping a secret like that can be problematic in a relationship. Trust is crucial, and if a spouse feels the need to check the other's phone because of a lie, that's a red flag.\n\nBut wait, the wife went through his phone, which is generally considered a violation of privacy. However, the husband initially lied, so maybe he's at fault for not being honest. The wife's action (checking the phone) is a consequence of the husband's dishonesty. If he had been truthful from the start, maybe she wouldn't have resorted to that. \n\nHusbands are expected to be honest with their partners, especially about things that can affect the relationship. Even if he thought the friendship was innocent, not telling his wife the truth when he promised to stop is a breach of trust. The wife's anger is a reaction to being lied to, and her method of finding out (checking the phone) is not great, but it's a response to the husband's actions. \n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, the husband's lie is a significant issue. Relationships require honesty, and keeping a secret like this, even if the friendship is innocent, can lead to bigger problems. The wife's action is wrong too, but the initial wrongdoing is the husband's lie. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he lied and didn't follow through with his promise, leading to a breakdown in trust. The wife's phone-checking is a consequence but doesn't absolve him of the lie.\n"
