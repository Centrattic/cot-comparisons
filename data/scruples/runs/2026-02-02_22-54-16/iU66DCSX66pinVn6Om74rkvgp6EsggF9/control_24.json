A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author lied to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The wife found out he was still texting her, which made her angry. She also went through his phone, which he seems to think is her fault.\n\nFirst, the author had a conflict with his wife when she found out about the text messages. He initially told his wife he wasn't friends with Liz anymore to appease her, but he kept in touch. That sounds like a lie of omission or a direct lie. When someone makes a promise and then breaks it, that's usually a problem. The wife trusted him to follow through on that promise, and he didn't. So, from the wife's perspective, he betrayed her trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife went through his phone, which is a privacy issue. She did something that's generally considered invasive. The author might argue that her actions were wrong, but that doesn't necessarily excuse his lie. The question is whether he's in the wrong for lying. Even if the wife acted inappropriately by checking his phone, his initial deceit is still a separate issue. \n\nThe author might say he lied to keep the peace because the wife was already upset. But lying to someone you're in a relationship with is typically seen as a breach of trust. Relationships require honesty, and hiding the fact that you're still in contact with someone you were told to avoid can be damaging. \n\nThe wife's anger could stem from feeling lied to and disrespected. Even if her method of finding out (checking the phone) was wrong, the core issue is the broken trust. So, while the wife's actions are problematic, the author's lie is also a significant issue. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author did lie, which is generally wrong in a relationship. Therefore, he's at least partially to blame. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
