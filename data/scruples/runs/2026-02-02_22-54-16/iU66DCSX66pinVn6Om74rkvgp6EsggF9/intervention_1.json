A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the key points are: The author had a female coworker, Liz, who started dating another woman. Liz confided in him via text about relationship issues. The author shared these texts with his wife, but she misinterpreted the messages, leading to her demanding he stop being friends with Liz. To appease her, he said he wouldn't, but continued the friendship secretly. Later, the wife found out and is upset about the lie. The author is torn between his wife's reaction and the fact that she went through his phone.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider the dynamics. The author lied about ending the friendship. Even if his wife misinterpreted the initial situation, the author chose to deceive her. Honesty in a relationship is crucial. While the wife's actions (checking the phone) are problematic, that doesn't justify the lie. The author should have addressed the situation by communicating openly instead of hiding the friendship. Lying, regardless of the reason, can erode trust. So, the author is in the wrong for not being truthful with his wife. The answer should be A.\n"
