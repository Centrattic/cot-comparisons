A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the AITA post) is in the wrong for lying to his wife about no longer being friends with Liz. \n\nFirst, the context: The author was having a conversation with his wife about Liz, a female coworker who was in a relationship that turned out shady. The author shared messages from Liz where Liz was questioning her relationship. The wife misinterpreted the conversation, thinking the author was suggesting Liz wanted to have sex with him and that he was badmouthing the wife. The wife then made the author promise not to be friends with Liz anymore. However, the author kept in touch with Liz at work, didn't tell his wife, and now the wife found out by checking his phone.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. The author lied about maintaining a friendship. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, lying is a breach of trust.\n2. The wife's initial reaction was based on a misunderstanding, but the author didn't clarify properly.\n3. The wife's act of checking his phone is also problematic, since it's an invasion of privacy.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's decision to lie. Regardless of the wife's actions, lying about something as significant as a friendship, especially after making a promise, is a serious issue. Trust is foundational in a marriage, and lying can cause more damage than the original situation. The author's justification might be that the wife was being unreasonable, but that doesn't excuse the lie. The wife's actions (checking the phone) are also wrong, but both parties are at fault here. However, the question specifically asks if the author is in the wrong, and lying is a key factor. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
