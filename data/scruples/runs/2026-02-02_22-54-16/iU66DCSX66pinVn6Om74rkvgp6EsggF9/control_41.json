A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a spouse who lied about continuing a friendship with a female coworker after his wife forbade it. The user's question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband, let's call him John, had a female coworker, Liz, who was dating someone. Liz confided in John, and during this, she mentioned not having sex with a guy in two years. John shared this conversation with his wife, but she misinterpreted it, leading to a conflict. John then agreed not to be friends with Liz anymore to appease his wife. However, he secretly continued the friendship, and his wife found out by checking his phone.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether John was wrong to lie about maintaining the friendship. The wife's actions of checking his phone are also in question. The user wants to know if the author (John) is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not).\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, lying to a spouse is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if John had good intentions, such as trying to avoid conflict or because he felt the wife was being unreasonable (like during her period), the act of deception is a key point. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and lying can erode that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions of checking his phone without permission could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, that doesn't justify the husband's lie. The wife's initial reaction\u2014demanding he cut ties with Liz\u2014might have been harsh, but John's response was to lie instead of addressing the issue honestly. \n\nEven if the wife acted inconsiderately, the husband's choice to deceive her is a problem. The question is about who is the asshole, and in these situations, the person who lies is often seen as the asshole, even if the other party did something questionable. The husband's decision to keep the friendship secret shows a lack of honesty, which is a core value in relationships. \n\nMoreover, the wife's reason for asking him to stop seeing Liz was based on a past misunderstanding. If John had communicated more clearly about the actual situation (e.g., that Liz's comments were about her own relationship, not about the wife), maybe the conflict could have been resolved without lying. Instead, he chose deceit, which complicates things further when discovered.\n\nThe wife's phone-checking is indeed a problem, but it's a separate issue. The husband's lie is the primary cause of the current conflict. Even if the wife's behavior was flawed in other ways, the husband's dishonesty is a clear violation of trust. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the lie is a significant issue in a relationship, regardless of the wife's actions.\n"
