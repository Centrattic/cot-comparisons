A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband lying to his wife about ending a friendship with a female coworker, Liz. The key points here are the initial text exchange where the husband mentions his loyalty to his wife to Liz, the wife's misunderstanding leading to her cutting off Liz, and then the husband not being completely honest about continuing the friendship.\n\nFirst, the husband did lie to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. That's a clear point. But the context is important. The wife had a justified reason for being upset because she thought the husband was being disloyal. However, the husband's actual stance was the opposite. The question is whether the lie was a \"white lie\" to keep the peace or if it's a betrayal of trust.\n\nWhen the wife found out through her phone that the friendship continued, she went through his phone. That's a breach of privacy, which is a separate issue. The husband's lie might be seen as a way to avoid conflict, especially if he thought the friendship wasn't harmful. But not being honest about it, especially when he had previously agreed to end the friendship, could erode trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions of checking his phone without permission are also problematic. It's a violation of privacy, so she's not entirely blameless. The husband's lie might be a reaction to her previous behavior and the initial misunderstanding. But in relationships, honesty is a cornerstone. Even if the intention was good, lying can lead to bigger issues. The husband might have handled it better by setting boundaries or explaining the situation more clearly instead of lying.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the husband did lie, but the wife's overreaction and privacy invasion also contributed. However, the lie itself, regardless of intent, is a betrayal of trust. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong (A) because he lied about ending a friendship when he didn't, which is a breach of trust, even if the wife's actions were also questionable.\n"
