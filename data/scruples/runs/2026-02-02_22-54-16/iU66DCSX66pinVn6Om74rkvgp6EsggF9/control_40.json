A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a husband who lied to his wife about not being friends with a female coworker named Liz. The wife found out he was still in contact and is upset. The user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for lying or if the wife is.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband had a conversation with Liz where he gave advice about her relationship. Then he told his wife about the situation, but during that, he included a conversation where Liz seemed uncertain about her relationship. The wife misunderstood, thinking he was being unfaithful. To avoid a bigger conflict, the husband agreed to stop being friends with Liz, but he didn't actually do it. Now the wife found out he was lying and is mad.\n\nSo the main issues are: lying about the friendship, the wife checking his phone, and the husband's intent. The husband claims he was just trying to keep the peace. But lying to a spouse about their friends is a big deal. Even if he thought he was protecting the marriage, keeping that secret and continuing the friendship without honesty is a breach of trust. The wife had a reason to be jealous, but going through his phone is also a violation. However, the husband's lie is still a problem.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if the wife overreacted, the husband should have been honest from the start. Lying to avoid conflict isn't a good justification. The fact that he kept in touch despite promising to stop is the main issue. So the author is in the wrong for lying, even if the wife's actions were also inappropriate. The answer is A.\n"
