A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with a female coworker, Liz, where Liz was going through a relationship issue. The author discussed this with his wife, and during that conversation, he quoted Liz saying she didn't want to be with her girlfriend. The wife misinterpreted this and accused the author of Liz wanting to have a relationship with him. The author tried to explain but failed, so he agreed not to be friends with Liz to appease her. However, he continued being friends at work. Later, the wife found out he was still texting Liz and confronted him about the lie. The wife also went through his phone, which the author found unfair.\n\nNow, considering the details. The author did lie about not being friends with Liz. Even though he thought he was just agreeing to a request to avoid conflict, he continued the friendship. That's a lie by omission or a direct lie, depending on how he said it. Lying is generally a problem in relationships. On the other hand, the wife's actions of checking his phone without permission are also problematic. \n\nBut the question is about the author's wrongness. The lie itself is on his part. Even if the wife misinterpreted the situation initially, he could have handled it differently. Instead of lying, he could have set boundaries or been honest about maintaining a professional relationship. The lie, regardless of the context, is his responsibility. So, even though the wife's actions are not justified, the author's dishonesty is a key issue here. Therefore, the answer would be A (he is in the wrong) because he lied.\n"
