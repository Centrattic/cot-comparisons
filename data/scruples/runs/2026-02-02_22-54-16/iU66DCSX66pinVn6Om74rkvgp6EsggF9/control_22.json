A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation started when the author was texting Liz, a female coworker, who was going through a breakup. The author shared these texts with his wife, which led to a misunderstanding where his wife thought Liz was interested in him. The wife then insisted he cut off contact with Liz. He agreed but continued texting her at work.\n\nNow, the wife found out through her period of anger and checking his phone. The question is about whether the author is at fault for lying about maintaining contact. \n\nLooking at the key points: The author initially lied to his wife by keeping in touch with Liz despite promising not to. Even if the wife went through his phone, which isn't okay, the author broke his promise. The wife's action was wrong, but the author's dishonesty is also a problem. \n\nThe main issue is the broken trust. Even if there were extenuating circumstances (like work relationships), the author chose to deceive his wife. Honesty in a relationship is crucial, and lying, even to avoid conflict, undermines trust. So, the author is in the wrong here. The wife's method of checking the phone is also bad, but that doesn't excuse the author's lie. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
