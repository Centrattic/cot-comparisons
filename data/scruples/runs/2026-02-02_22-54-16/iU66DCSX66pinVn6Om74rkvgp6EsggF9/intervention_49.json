A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about lying to his wife about maintaining a friendship with a female coworker named Liz.\n\nFirst, the author tells his wife that he's not friends with Liz anymore to appease her after a conflict. But he actually continues to text her at work. The wife later finds out by checking his phone and is upset. The author is asking if he's the asshole for not telling the truth, or if the wife is for checking his phone.\n\nHmm. So the key points here: the author lied about ending the friendship. His wife wanted him to stop being friends with Liz, so he said he would but didn't. Then the wife invaded his privacy by checking his phone. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is important. The author made a promise he didn't keep. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, lying about something he agreed to might be a problem. But then again, the wife's method of finding out (checking his phone without permission) is also a breach of trust.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he promised to stop being friends and didn't, that's dishonest. However, the wife's actions are also problematic. The situation is a bit of a conflict in terms of who's at fault.\n\nBut the original question is about the author's actions. If he broke a promise, even if it's under a strained relationship, that's generally considered wrong. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong). But some might argue that the wife's behavior was worse, but the question is specifically about the author's actions. So the lie is the issue here.\n"
