A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a husband who lied to his wife about not being friends with a coworker named Liz after a previous conflict. The wife found out he was still in contact, which led to her anger.\n\nFirst, the author had a conversation with Liz where Liz was questioning her relationship. The author advised her to end it if she didn't feel that strong about her girlfriend. The wife misunderstood this as the author being unfaithful or Liz being interested in him. The author tried to explain but the wife didn't believe him and forbade him from being friends with Liz. He agreed not to, but continued secretly.\n\nNow, the key points here are the initial lie to the wife and the subsequent continued contact. The author says he stopped being friends, but in reality, he kept texting. When the wife found out, she's upset. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for not telling her he was still in touch, or if the wife is wrong for going through his phone.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, honesty in a relationship is usually considered important. The author made a commitment to the wife to cut off contact with Liz but didn't follow through. That's a lie by omission, so he's not being truthful. Even if the wife was being unreasonable or checking his phone without permission, the author still broke his promise. The wife's actions (checking phone) are also questionable, but that doesn't justify the author's dishonesty. The fact that the author continued the friendship despite promising not to is a breach of trust. So, even if the wife's methods were wrong, the author's action of lying is also wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
