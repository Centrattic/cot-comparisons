A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with Liz, a female coworker who was dating someone who lied to her. The author was texting Liz and mentioned loving his wife, which his wife overheard. She got upset and told him not to be friends with Liz. He agreed not to, but kept texting her anyway. Now the wife found out and is angry. The author is asking if he's at fault for not being honest about continuing the friendship.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception and trust. The author made a promise to his wife not to be friends with Liz, but he broke that promise. Even though he might have had reasons (like work), lying is a breach of trust. The wife checked his phone, which is also a violation of privacy, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. The author chose to deceive his wife, which is a significant issue. The wife's reaction is understandable, even if her method of checking his phone was wrong. The author's actions led to her distrust. So, the main fault here is the author's lie. Even if the wife overstepped by checking his phone, the author broke trust first. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
