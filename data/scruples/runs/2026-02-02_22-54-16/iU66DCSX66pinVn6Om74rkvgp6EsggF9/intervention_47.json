A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz after he promised not to. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had a friend Liz who started dating another woman, and there was some conflict. The author discussed this with his wife, which led to her thinking he was involved in a way he wasn't. She then forbade him from being friends with Liz. He told her he wouldn't, but continued the friendship secretly. Now, the wife found out by checking his phone.\n\nSo the key points are: the author lied about ending the friendship, and the wife found out by invading his privacy. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants an opinion.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author's actions: lying about a friendship could be seen as a breach of trust. But he did it to appease his wife, thinking she was being unreasonable. The wife's actions: checking his phone without permission is a privacy violation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he made a promise he didn't keep. Even if his wife was overreacting, keeping a promise is important in a relationship. Lying, even to avoid conflict, can damage trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's method of confronting him was through invasion of privacy, which is also wrong. So both have issues. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since he lied, technically, he's in the wrong. However, the wife's actions are also problematic. \n\nBut in most relationships, honesty is a cornerstone. Lying to protect the relationship isn't a good solution. So even if the wife's approach was wrong, the author's lie is still his responsibility. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
