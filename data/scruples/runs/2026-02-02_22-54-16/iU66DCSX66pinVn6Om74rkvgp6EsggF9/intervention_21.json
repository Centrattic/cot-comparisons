A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker named Liz who came out as a lesbian and had issues in her relationship. The author discussed Liz's texts with their wife, including a statement that the author said to Liz, which was then misinterpreted by the wife. The wife became upset and told the author not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author complied verbally but continued to be friends with Liz at work. Now, the wife found out and is upset about the lie. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author lied about cutting off contact with Liz, even though they were told not to be friends. But the wife went through their phone, which is a privacy violation. The author's reasoning is that the wife was being unreasonable, perhaps due to her own moods. \n\nThe key here is the initial advice the author gave to Liz, which the wife misheard as the author being interested in Liz. The author tried to explain but the wife wasn't convinced. Then, the author lied about ending the friendship to make the wife feel better, but continued the friendship. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and trust are crucial. Even if the wife was acting out of jealousy or mood, the author's decision to lie about ending the friendship is a breach of trust. The wife's action of checking the phone is also wrong, but the author's continued contact and lying is a bigger issue. The author should have honored the agreement they made with the wife, even if it meant secretly maintaining a friendship. The lie, regardless of the wife's behavior, is the author's key fault here. So the answer is A.\n"
