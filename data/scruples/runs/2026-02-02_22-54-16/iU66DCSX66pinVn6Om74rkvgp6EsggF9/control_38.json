A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author lied to his wife about not being friends with a coworker named Liz. They had a conflict where the wife found out he was still texting Liz, and now she's mad. The author is asking if he's the asshole for lying or if the wife is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author initially told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her, but he kept in touch secretly. Then the wife discovered the ongoing communication and confronted him. The author is defensive, saying he lied to keep the peace but the wife invaded his privacy by checking his phone.\n\nSo, the main issue is deception in the relationship. Trust is a big part of any marriage. By lying about cutting off contact, the author broke that trust. Even if the wife was being unreasonable before, the author's decision to lie rather than be honest might be problematic. When a spouse asks for something, even if it's a difficult request, being honest is usually the better approach. Lying to avoid conflict can lead to bigger issues later.\n\nAlso, the wife's action of checking his phone is a breach of privacy, but that doesn't make her the sole wrongdoer. Both parties made choices here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of lying to his wife is a significant factor. Even if he had reasons, the lie itself is a betrayal of trust. The wife's anger is a result of that lie. So while the wife's actions aren't justified either, the author's deception is a key issue here.\n\nAnother angle is the initial conversation where the author was discussing Liz's texts with his wife. The wife misinterpreted the conversation, leading to the conflict. But the author's response to the wife's anger was to lie about cutting off contact, which was a mistake. Instead of addressing the underlying issues, he tried to placate her with a lie, which backfired.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually prioritized over temporary peace. So, the author's choice to lie, while perhaps meant to avoid immediate conflict, led to a bigger problem. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not being truthful with his wife about the continued friendship. The wife's action is also wrong, but the primary issue here is the author's deception.\n"
