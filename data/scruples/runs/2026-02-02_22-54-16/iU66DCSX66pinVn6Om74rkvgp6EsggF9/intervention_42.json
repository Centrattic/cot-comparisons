A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The situation started when the author shared a conversation with Liz about her relationship, which led the wife to believe the author was flirting with Liz. The author tried to reassure her but the wife became upset and asked him not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author agreed but continued the friendship secretly. Now the wife found out through his phone and is angry.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the author's decision to lie about his friendship with Liz. Even though the wife's initial reaction might have been based on a misunderstanding, the author chose to keep the friendship going behind her back. Marriage often involves trust and honesty, so keeping such a secret could be seen as a breach of that trust. The wife's actions of checking the phone might be questionable, but the author's dishonesty is the root of the conflict here.\n\nEven if the author felt the wife's reaction was unfair, the solution of lying isn't the right approach. Open communication is crucial in relationships. By not being honest, the author created a situation where the wife had to resort to checking his phone, which escalated the issue. The fact that the author continued the friendship despite the wife's explicit request adds to the problem. While the wife's actions might have stemmed from jealousy or insecurity, the author's lack of transparency is a significant fault here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not maintaining honesty in the relationship.\n"
