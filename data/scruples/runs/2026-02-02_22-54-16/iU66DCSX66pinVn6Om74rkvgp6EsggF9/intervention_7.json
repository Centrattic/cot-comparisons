A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz. The situation involves a coworker, Liz, who had a relationship that ended badly. The author was texting Liz and shared some of the conversations with his wife, which led to a misunderstanding. The wife took the author's message the wrong way and wanted him to cut off contact with Liz. He agreed but continued the friendship secretly. Later, when his wife found out, he lied about not being friends anymore. Now she's angry because she found out through her phone.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is honesty in the relationship. The author initially told his wife he wasn't friends with Liz to make her happy, but he continued the friendship. When confronted, he lied again. Honesty is a cornerstone of trust in a relationship. Even if the wife's actions (checking his phone) were wrong, the author's dishonesty is a problem. He didn't address the root issue of his wife's insecurity or the initial misunderstanding. Instead, he chose to deceive her, which can erode trust over time. Relationships require transparency, and lying to avoid conflict isn't a sustainable solution. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned to avoid arguments, are ethically questionable. The wife's behavior is not justified either, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So, even if the wife is at fault for checking his phone, the author is in the wrong for lying about maintaining contact with Liz. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
