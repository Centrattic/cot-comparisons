A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who lied to his wife about not being friends with a female coworker, Liz. The wife found out he was still texting her and is upset. The husband says he lied to appease her when she asked him not to be friends, but he kept the friendship. The wife then checked his phone and confronted him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband initially lied to his wife about ending the friendship with Liz to make her stop being upset. However, he continued the friendship in secret. When the wife found out, she used the phone to check, which might be a privacy issue. \n\nThe main issue is whether the husband was wrong for lying. Honesty in a marriage is usually a big factor. Even if the wife's behavior was questionable (like checking his phone), the husband's decision to lie about his actions could be seen as a betrayal of trust. Marriages typically require open communication, and lying about ongoing relationships, even if done to avoid conflict initially, can erode trust.\n\nAlso, the wife's action of checking the phone is problematic because it invades privacy, but that doesn't justify the husband's lie. Both parties have acted in ways that could be considered wrong, but the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is the one at fault.\n\nThe husband's lie was a deliberate choice to deceive his wife after making a promise not to be friends. Even if the wife's motives were not entirely rational (like being moody), the lie was still a breach of trust. The fact that he continued the friendship despite promising otherwise adds to the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's method of checking the phone is invasive and not a healthy way to address her concerns. However, the question is about the husband's actions. The husband's initial lie and ongoing deception are the main points here. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the husband is in the wrong (A) because he lied about ending the friendship, which is a violation of trust. The wife's actions are also wrong, but the question focuses on the husband's responsibility.\n"
