A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with his wife about Liz, a female coworker who was dating a girl. The author gave some advice to Liz via text, which his wife misinterpreted, leading to her being upset. The wife then demanded the author to stop being friends with Liz. He agreed not to, but continued the friendship secretly. Later, when his wife found out, she was angry. Now, he's being blamed for lying, and she went through his phone.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial lie about cutting off contact with Liz and the wife's subsequent invasion of privacy to discover the truth. \n\nThe author's side: He tried to appease his wife by saying he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, but he actually kept the friendship. That's a lie. However, the wife then went through his phone, which is a privacy violation. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of lying is a clear violation of trust. Even if the wife was being unreasonable or using her \"time of the month\" as a reason, the author still chose to deceive her. Honesty is a cornerstone of trust in a relationship. By promising to cut off contact and then lying about it, he broke that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions of going through his phone are also problematic. Privacy is important, and she overstepped by invading his privacy. However, that doesn't excuse the author's lie. The initial lie is the main issue here. \n\nIn relationships, when one partner lies to the other, even to avoid conflict, it's generally considered wrong. The author prioritized his friendship over his commitment to his wife. Even if the wife's reaction was harsh, lying isn't the solution. He should have addressed the situation honestly, perhaps explaining that he couldn't cut off a colleague just because of a misunderstanding. \n\nAdditionally, the author's initial texts with Liz might have contributed to the misunderstanding. Advising Liz in a way that could be misinterpreted as inappropriate, even if it wasn't his intent, led to the wife's insecurity and the subsequent lie. \n\nSo, while the wife's actions are also inconsiderate, the author's lie is a breach of trust. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
