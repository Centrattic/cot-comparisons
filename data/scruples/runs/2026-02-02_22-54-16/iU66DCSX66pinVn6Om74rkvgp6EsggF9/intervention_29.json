A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The situation involves a coworker named Liz who came out as a lesbian and then had a bad experience. The author was confiding in his wife about Liz's texts, and during that, Liz mentioned not having sex with a guy in two years and questioning the relationship. The author gave advice, which his wife misinterpreted as Liz being interested in him. The wife then made him stop being friends with Liz, but he continued secretly. Now, the wife found out and is upset. The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author did lie about not being friends with Liz anymore. Even if it was to appease his wife, he intentionally withheld the truth. Lying is generally considered wrong, especially in a relationship where trust is crucial. However, the wife also went through his phone, which is a privacy violation. That's a significant point. \n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. Even though the wife's actions were wrong, the author's lie is the primary issue here. The author could have handled the situation differently. Maybe he should have explained the context better when his wife misunderstood the conversation. Also, continuing the friendship without being honest was a mistake. Trust is important, and lying, even if for a reason, can damage that trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the initial misunderstanding was extreme\u2014telling him he couldn't be friends with Liz. That might have been an overreaction. But the fact remains that the author didn't follow through on his promise, leading to the current conflict. \n\nSo, while both parties made mistakes, the author's lie is a clear breach of trust. The wife's phone-checking is definitely wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking about the author's actions specifically, the lie is the main issue. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
