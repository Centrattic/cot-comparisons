  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for lying to my wife?\nHopefully this is not as cut and dry as it may seem. A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was texting his wife about a coworker Liz who was having issues with her girlfriend. During this conversation, he said something that made his wife think he was encouraging Liz to leave her girlfriend and maybe be with him. The wife gets upset and tells him not to be friends with Liz anymore. He agrees, but then continues the friendship secretly. Now the wife found out and is angry. The question is whether the author lied by not cutting off Liz, or if the wife is wrong for checking his phone.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are honesty in the relationship, the initial misunderstanding, and the ongoing friendship. The author did lie about cutting off contact with Liz, even though his wife specifically asked him not to be friends. That's a lie by omission, maybe? He said he wouldn't be friends, but he kept texting. That's definitely deceitful. \n\nThen there's the wife checking his phone. While it's not ideal, she's acting out of anger and suspicion. But the author's actions of lying are the main issue here. The wife's behavior is problematic too, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he specifically promised to cut off contact and didn't, he's the one who broke the agreement. The phone-checking is a separate issue, but the author's lie is a breach of trust. \n\nSo the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he lied about his friendship, which is a significant issue in a relationship. The wife's actions are also wrong, but the main question is about the author's responsibility.\n"
