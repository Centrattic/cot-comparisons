A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the author had a situation where a female coworker, Liz, was going through a relationship issue. The author discussed this with their wife, but the wife misinterpreted the conversation, thinking the author was interested in Liz. The wife then forbade the author from being friends with Liz. However, the author continued the friendship secretly.\n\nThe key points here are the initial lie. The author told the wife they wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her, but kept in touch anyway. Then, when the wife found out, the author didn't correct the falsehood, leading to the wife checking the phone and discovering the lie.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. Even if the initial request to cut ties was based on a misunderstanding, the author chose to lie about maintaining the friendship. The wife's anger stems from being deceived, which is a valid reaction. While the wife's method of checking the phone is questionable, the author's dishonesty is the root cause of the conflict. \n\nThe author's actions breach trust, which is a fundamental aspect of a marriage. Even if the author's intentions were to avoid conflict initially, the ongoing secrecy is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the lie, regardless of the wife's reaction.\n"
