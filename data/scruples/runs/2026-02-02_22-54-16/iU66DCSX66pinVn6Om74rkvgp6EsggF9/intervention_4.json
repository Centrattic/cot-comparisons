A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, let's call him John, had a female coworker named Liz. Liz started dating a girl, and later found out the girlfriend was lying and doing shady stuff. John was texting Liz to vent about his wife. In those texts, Liz mentioned she hadn't had sex with a guy in two years and was unsure about the relationship. John responded by saying he loves his wife more than anything and that if she can't imagine living without her, she shouldn't stay. \n\nJohn's wife misinterpreted this, thinking Liz wanted to have sex with John and that he was talking bad about her. The wife then told John he couldn't be friends with Liz anymore. John agreed to stop, but secretly kept in touch. Now, the wife discovered this by checking his phone and is upset. John is asking if he's at fault for lying about not being friends with Liz or if his wife is at fault for checking his phone.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the secrecy and lying. John lied to his wife about cutting off contact with Liz, which he did to appease her. However, he continued the friendship. The wife then found out through snooping. So, there's a question of whether John was justified in lying, especially since he kept the friendship, and whether the wife's actions (checking the phone) are valid.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, honesty is crucial. John lied to his wife, which is a breach of trust. Even if he had good intentions (to make her feel better), the lie is still a lie. The wife's reaction to the initial texts was based on a misunderstanding, but that doesn't justify John continuing the friendship in secret. Maintaining that friendship without his wife's knowledge after promising to stop could be seen as deceitful.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife checking his phone is also problematic. Privacy is important in relationships, but invading someone's privacy without consent is generally considered wrong. However, her actions might stem from insecurity or past issues. But that doesn't make her right.\n\nSo, the dilemma is whether the lie (John's) is worse than the snooping (wife's). In most cases, lying is a bigger issue because it's a direct betrayal of trust. John's lie could erode the wife's trust further, especially if she finds out he was hiding his continued friendship. Even if his initial response to Liz was innocent, the ongoing friendship without transparency is a problem. \n\nTherefore, John is in the wrong for lying about cutting off communication with Liz. The wife's actions are also wrong, but the primary issue lies with John's dishonesty. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
