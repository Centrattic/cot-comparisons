A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore, even though he continued texting her. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author had a coworker, Liz, who was straight and then came out as dating a girl. The author was confiding in his wife about Liz's situation through texts. Then, Liz said she hadn't had sex with a guy in two years and questioned if she wanted to continue the relationship. The author responded by saying he loves his wife and that Liz should end her relationship. \n\nHis wife misunderstood this and thought the author was insinuating he wanted to have sex with Liz and badmouthing her. She then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. To keep the peace, the author told her he wouldn't, but actually kept in touch. Now, the wife found out and is angry. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the original misunderstanding caused by the author's text, the lie about cutting ties with Liz, and the wife checking his phone.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. When the wife asked him to not be friends with Liz, he agreed, but continued the friendship. That's a lie. Lying is generally a breach of trust in a relationship. Even if the wife was being unreasonable because she's moody, the author chose to lie instead of addressing her concerns honestly. \n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Why did he lie? If he thought the wife was overreacting, perhaps he should have tried to explain the misunderstanding again, rather than making a promise he didn't intend to keep. Also, the fact that he was still texting Liz after the wife's request suggests that he values his friendship with Liz over his wife's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife went through his phone without permission, which is also a breach of privacy. But the author's lie is a direct action that's unethical. The wife's actions are in response to the lie. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. Even if the wife's initial reaction was based on a misunderstanding, the author's lie compounds the issue. The wife's anger is justified because he was dishonest. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A). \n\nWait, but the user mentioned it's \"that time of the month\" and she's acting unreasonably. That might imply she's not in the best state of mind. However, lying to a spouse about cutting ties with a coworker is a significant issue. The author's choice to lie rather than handle the situation maturely by communicating clearly or distancing himself from Liz as promised is his fault. \n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n"
