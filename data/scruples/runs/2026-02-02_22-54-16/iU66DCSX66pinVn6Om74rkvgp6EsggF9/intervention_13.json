A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with a female coworker, Liz. The situation started when Liz confided in him about her new relationship, and he shared some of the conversation with his wife. The wife misunderstood the conversation, thinking he was suggesting Liz wanted to have sex with him and was talking bad about her. This led to the wife forbidding him from being friends with Liz. The author then lied and said he wasn't friends with her anymore, but in reality, they remained friends at work. Later, the wife found out through his texts that he was still in contact, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author's intentions were to keep the peace with his wife by not being honest. He might have believed that cutting off contact would help, but he compromised by continuing to be friends secretly. The wife's anger stems from feeling lied to, which is a valid reaction. However, her going through his phone is a privacy violation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, he didn't tell his wife the truth about maintaining contact, which could be seen as deceitful. On the other, his wife's actions of checking his phone are also problematic. The initial misunderstanding might have contributed to the situation. The author's lie was to appease her, but lying in a relationship is generally frowned upon. However, the wife's actions in invading his privacy are also a significant factor here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, lying is a breach of trust, regardless of the reason. Even if it was to avoid conflict, the lie could have long-term consequences. However, the wife's actions are also questionable. The balance here is tricky. The author might have handled it differently by being honest and negotiating boundaries instead of lying. But the wife's method of confronting him by checking his phone without consent is also wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have contributed to the problem. The author lied, but the wife's initial overreaction and her invasion of privacy are also at fault. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since he did lie, even if the wife's actions were also wrong, the act of lying still makes him partially responsible. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, considering the wife also violated privacy, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). I need to decide based on typical standards of right and wrong in relationships. Lying is generally considered a fault, so the answer could be A. However, if the lie was a minor one to maintain peace and the wife's actions are worse, maybe B. But the key point is that he lied, which is a breach of trust, so A might be the answer here.\n"
