A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for lying to their wife about not being friends with a coworker named Liz. The situation started when Liz's girlfriend was lying and doing shady stuff, and Liz confided in the author. Then the author mentioned to his wife something Liz said about not having sex with a guy in two years and not knowing if she wanted to continue the relationship. The wife misunderstood this as Liz wanting to get close to the author, leading to a rift. The wife made the author stop being friends with Liz, but he continued secretly. Now, the wife found out and is angry, and he's questioning if he was wrong to lie.\n\nSo, first, the author initially lied about not being friends with Liz after the wife told him not to. That's a clear instance of deception. Even if the wife was being unreasonable or acting out of jealousy, the author chose to continue the friendship while telling her he wouldn't. That's a breach of trust. \n\nBut wait, the wife went through his phone. That's a violation of privacy. However, the author's actions were also a violation of their agreement. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the wife's methods were wrong, the author's deception is still a problem. \n\nThe wife might have overreacted, but the author's lie is a separate issue. In relationships, honesty is crucial. If the author thought the wife's anger was unreasonable, he should have communicated better instead of lying. The fact that he lied to appease her but continued the friendship shows a lack of transparency. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he lied about ending the friendship, which is a breach of trust, regardless of the wife's actions. Both sides have issues, but the author's deception is a key factor here.\n"
