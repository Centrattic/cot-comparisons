A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person posting the question) is at fault here. The situation involves lying to his wife about maintaining a friendship with a female coworker named Liz after their initial conflict.\n\nFirst, the author initially lied to his wife about cutting off contact with Liz to appease her. Even though he said he wouldn't be friends anymore, he continued texting her at work. Then, when his wife found out by checking his phone, he's asking if he's the one at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a promise to stop being friends with Liz but didn't keep it. The wife then discovered the lie by going through his phone. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying, or if the wife is the problem for checking his phone.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. If a spouse asks for honesty and you lie, that's a breach of trust. Even if the wife's method of checking the phone is questionable, the fact that the author lied first is a major issue. The wife's actions might be wrong, but the initial problem was the author's dishonesty. So, the author is probably at fault here. The answer would be A, since he broke his promise and lied to his wife.\n"
