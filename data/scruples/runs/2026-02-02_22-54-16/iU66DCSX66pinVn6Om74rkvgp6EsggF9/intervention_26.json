A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not talking to Liz anymore. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the author was initially truthful when he told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her. However, he continued texting with Liz at work. Then, when his wife found out by checking his phone, he's being questioned about whether lying was wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the initial promise to stop being friends and the subsequent continued communication. The author didn't lie about the texts happening; he just didn't mention them. But he did say he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, which technically, he broke by staying in touch. \n\nThen there's the wife's part, where she went through his phone. Is her action justifiable? The author tried to give her space during her \"time of the month,\" but she still took it upon herself to check his phone. That's a privacy issue.\n\nBut the main question is about the author's responsibility. Did he have a duty to be honest about continuing to talk to Liz? Even if it was to appease his wife, once he made that promise, he should have followed through. Lying about ending a friendship to make a spouse happy is a gray area, but he did lie about it. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's method of finding out (checking his phone) is questionable. But the author's initial deception is still a problem. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is in the wrong because he lied about ending the friendship, even if it was to make his wife feel better. Honesty in a relationship is important, and he broke that trust.\n"
