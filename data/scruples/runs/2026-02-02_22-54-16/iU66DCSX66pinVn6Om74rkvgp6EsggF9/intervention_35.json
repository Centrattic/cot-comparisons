A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the story is about a person who lied to their wife about not being friends with a coworker named Liz after a conflict. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was confiding in Liz, who was their coworker. Liz was going through a breakup where her girlfriend had cheated or done something illegal. The author shared Liz's texts with his wife, and there was a conversation where the author advised Liz to end the relationship if she didn't feel committed. The wife misinterpreted this as the author being unfaithful or interested in Liz, leading her to demand that the author stop being friends with Liz. The author agreed but continued the friendship secretly. The wife later found out and is upset about the lie and invading his privacy by checking his phone.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong to lie to his wife about not being friends with Liz. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider the angles.\n\nOn one hand, the author promised the wife they wouldn't be friends anymore, but continued to do so. That's a breach of trust. When a spouse asks for something, even if they might be overreacting, keeping that promise is important in a relationship. The author might have felt the promise was unnecessary or that the wife was being unreasonable, but lying about it is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction could be seen as over the top. The original conversation between the author and Liz was about Liz's relationship issues, and the author's advice was about commitment. The wife's misinterpretation could be due to her own insecurities. Additionally, the wife went through the author's phone, which is a violation of privacy. That action is definitely wrong, regardless of the situation.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key point is the lie. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, lying about maintaining the friendship is a breach of trust. The author could have tried to explain the situation better instead of lying. However, if the wife was being overly controlling, maybe the author had a reason to keep the friendship, but lying isn't the right approach. Relationships require transparency, so the author's lie is problematic.\n\nThe wife's actions (checking the phone) are wrong, but that doesn't excuse the author's lie. So, the author is in the wrong for lying. However, the wife's behavior is also a factor. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they broke their promise and lied, regardless of the wife's actions.\n"
