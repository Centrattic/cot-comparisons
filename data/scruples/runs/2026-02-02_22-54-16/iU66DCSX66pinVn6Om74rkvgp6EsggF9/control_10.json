A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who lied to his wife about not being friends with a coworker, Liz, after a previous conflict. The wife found out he was still in contact and is upset, while he's asking if he's the asshole for lying.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author initially had a conversation with Liz where he advised her about her relationship. The wife misinterpreted the texts, thinking he was interested in Liz. The wife then made him promise not to be friends with Liz anymore. He agreed, but secretly continued. Now the wife found out, and he's questioning if he's wrong for lying again.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the act of lying to his wife. Even if the wife acted inappropriately by checking his phone, the husband lied about not being friends with Liz. Lying is generally a problem in relationships, especially when there's a history of mistrust. The fact that he made a promise and broke it is a key point. The wife's actions, while not great (privacy invasion), are a reaction to his deception.\n\nAlso, the husband tried to appease her by saying he would stop, but he didn't actually do it. That's a breach of trust. Even if the wife's method of finding out was wrong, the husband's lie is the root cause here. So, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong because he lied and broke his promise, even if the wife overstepped by checking his phone.\n"
