A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for lying to their wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The situation started when the author was talking to their wife about Liz's situation, and the wife misunderstood, thinking the author was suggesting Liz wanted to have a relationship with them. The wife then told the author to stop being friends with Liz. The author agreed but kept the friendship secretly. Now the wife found out and is angry.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the initial misunderstanding and the subsequent lies. The author tried to explain but the wife didn't believe them. Then, to appease her, the author said they wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore but actually continued the friendship. That's a lie. The wife found out through checking the phone, which is probably where the conflict escalates.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, lying to your spouse is generally a big no-no. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, the author chose to lie instead of being honest. Maybe the author thought they were protecting themselves or the relationship, but lying typically causes more issues. Even if the wife was acting out of jealousy or misunderstanding, the author's solution was to withhold the truth, which isn't healthy. The wife's action of checking the phone is definitely wrong, but the author's lie is also problematic. So, in a situation where there's a conflict, the right approach is to communicate openly, not lie. The author's lie likely made things worse and broke trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for continuing the friendship and lying about it. Answer A.\n"
