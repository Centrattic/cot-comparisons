A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz after telling her he wouldn't. \n\nSo the situation: He had a conversation with his wife where he told her he wasn't friends with Liz anymore after she was upset about his messages. But actually, he kept being friends with Liz at work. Now, his wife found out by checking his phone and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author said he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease his wife, but continued to be friends. That's a lie. The wife then checked his phone to find out the truth. \n\nOn one hand, lying about not being friends with someone when you actually are is a breach of trust. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, lying isn't justified. The author made a promise to stop being friends, which he didn't keep, leading to a betrayal of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife invading his privacy by checking his phone is also wrong. However, even if her method was wrong, the author still broke his promise. The wife might have felt the need to check because she trusted him, and when he lied, she had the right to be upset. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the lie. If he had kept his word, there wouldn't be a problem. The wife's actions (checking the phone) are a separate issue. So even if she was wrong to check his phone, the author's lie is still his fault. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for lying about his friendship with Liz after promising his wife he wouldn't. The answer should be A.\n"
