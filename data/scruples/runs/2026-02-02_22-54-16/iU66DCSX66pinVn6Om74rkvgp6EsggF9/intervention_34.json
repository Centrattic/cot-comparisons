A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about still being friends with Liz after promising not to. \n\nFirst, the initial situation: the author was confiding in Liz about their wife, which led to a misunderstanding. The wife took the conversation out of context, thinking the author was being unfaithful. The author tried to reassure her but failed, so they agreed to stop being friends with Liz. However, they continued the friendship secretly.\n\nNow, the wife found out and is upset. The author didn't tell her the truth about maintaining the friendship. The question is whether the author is wrong for lying. \n\nFrom a trust perspective, lying to a spouse is generally frowned upon. Even if the reason is to appease them, not being honest can erode trust. The author might have thought they were protecting the friendship or avoiding conflict, but keeping that secret and not being truthful when confronted is a problem. The wife's anger is justified because she felt betrayed. The author should have been honest from the start or addressed the issue directly when the relationship with Liz continued. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife checking the phone is also a problem because it's an invasion of privacy. However, the core issue here is the author's dishonesty. So even if the wife is in the wrong for checking the phone, the author's lie is still the main point of contention. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not being truthful about the friendship.\n"
