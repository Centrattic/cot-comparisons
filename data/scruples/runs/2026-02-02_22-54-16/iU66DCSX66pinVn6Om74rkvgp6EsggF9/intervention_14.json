A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a coworker named Liz who came out as gay and later had issues in her relationship. The author texted Liz, shared those texts with his wife, and said something that made his wife think Liz was trying to get him to leave her for another woman. The wife then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore, but he continued texting her at work. When the wife found out, she got angry, and the author is now wondering if he was wrong for not telling her the truth.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author initially told his wife he would stop being friends with Liz, but didn't actually do it. That's a lie. Now, the wife went through his phone, which is a privacy issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying or if the wife is the one at fault.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, honesty is usually a cornerstone. The author made a promise to his wife that he didn't keep. Even if the wife was being unreasonable or was going through her period, that's not an excuse for lying. The author's actions could erode trust, which is crucial in a marriage. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife invading his privacy by checking his phone is also wrong. However, the author's lie is a direct violation of trust. While both actions are problematic, the severity of lying might outweigh the wife's privacy breach. The author chose to deceive, which is a bigger issue than her checking his phone, even if that's also inappropriate. \n\nSo, the answer is A because the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife. The fact that he made a promise and then didn't follow through, regardless of the wife's actions, is a breach of trust that would typically be considered the wrong move in a relationship.\n"
