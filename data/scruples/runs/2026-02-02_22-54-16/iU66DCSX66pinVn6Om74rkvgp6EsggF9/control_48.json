A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about cutting off contact with a female coworker, Liz. The situation says that the wife found out he was still texting her and got angry.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty in a relationship and privacy. The author chose to lie to his wife when they had a conflict, which led to the wife checking his phone. The wife's action of going through the phone is definitely a red flag because it's a breach of privacy. However, the author's lie also matters. When he told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, he knew that wasn't true. Even if he was trying to appease her, lying is a problem because trust is crucial in relationships. \n\nThe wife's anger might stem from feeling betrayed by the lie. But the fact that she resorted to checking his phone without permission complicates things. Both actions\u2014lying and checking the phone\u2014involve ethical issues. The author didn't have to maintain the friendship if he wanted to avoid conflict, but choosing to lie instead of being honest when a trust issue arises is problematic. \n\nSo, while the wife's actions are wrong, the author's lie is also a significant factor. In most cases, lying in a relationship is considered a breach of trust, even if the other person is at fault for invading privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he lied, even though the wife's response was also inappropriate.\n"
