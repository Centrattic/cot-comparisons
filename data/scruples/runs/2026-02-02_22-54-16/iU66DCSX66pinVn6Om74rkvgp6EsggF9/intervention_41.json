A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a conversation with a female coworker, Liz, who was going through a relationship issue. The author told his wife about the conversation, and there was some misunderstanding that led to the wife being upset. The wife then made the author promise not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author said he would, but continued to be friends with her at work. Later, the wife found out by checking his phone and is now angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author did lie about no longer being friends with Liz, even though he promised his wife he wouldn't. But there's a nuance here: he might have thought that being friends at work didn't count as the kind of friendship his wife was referring to. However, the wife clearly stated she didn't want him to be friends with Liz anymore, so continuing the friendship, even in a professional context, could be seen as a betrayal of trust.\n\nThen there's the wife checking his phone. That's a privacy issue. But does that justify the author lying? Maybe not. The problem here is that the author made a promise and broke it, regardless of the reason. Even if the wife's method of checking the phone is wrong, the author's dishonesty is a separate issue. \n\nAlso, the wife might have felt the need to check the phone because she didn't trust the author after the initial lying. The author's initial lie about the conversation with Liz and the subsequent lie about the friendship could have eroded trust. So even if the wife's action is questionable, the author's dishonesty is a problem.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling the truth about maintaining the friendship. If the author considered the professional relationship as separate, maybe he felt it wasn't a lie, but the wife's perspective is that any friendship is off-limits. The author should have been honest from the start, maybe clarifying what kind of relationship with Liz was acceptable. By not doing so and continuing the friendship, he's in the wrong. The wife's checking the phone is her fault, but that doesn't excuse the author's dishonesty. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
