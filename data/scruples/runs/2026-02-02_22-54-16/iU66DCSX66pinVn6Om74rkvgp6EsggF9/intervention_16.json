A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation started when the wife found out the author was still in contact with Liz, which he had promised not to do. The author claims he didn't lie about the nature of their relationship, just the extent of communication. But technically, he did lie by omission\u2014he told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, but they continued to text. That's a lie, right? Because he didn't fully disclose the truth.\n\nThen there's the fact that the wife went through his phone. That's a privacy violation, which the author points out. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even though the wife's actions are questionable, the author did break his promise. Trust in a relationship is important, and lying\u2014even if the wife is overreacting\u2014can damage that trust. \n\nThe author might argue that the wife's initial reaction was unfair, especially since the wife found out during her \"moody time.\" But that doesn't excuse the lie. The root issue here is the deception. The author chose to deceive his wife to appease her, which isn't a good solution. Maintaining trust through honesty is crucial. \n\nEven if the wife is at fault for snooping, the author's lie is the catalyst for the current conflict. So, while both sides have issues, the author's dishonesty is a key problem here. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
