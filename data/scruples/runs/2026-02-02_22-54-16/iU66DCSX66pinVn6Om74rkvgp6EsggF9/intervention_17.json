A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author told Liz's girlfriend that he couldn't imagine living without his wife, which led his wife to think Liz wanted to have sex with him. The wife was upset, so he agreed not to be friends with Liz but kept in touch secretly. Now, the wife found out and is angry. She went through his phone to confirm.\n\nSo, the main issue is the lie about still being friends with Liz. The author's argument is that he was trying to appease his wife, even though he kept the friendship. The wife then went through his phone, which he might see as overstepping.\n\nBut from the wife's perspective, he lied. Even if it was to make her happy, lying is a breach of trust. The fact that he continued the friendship despite promising otherwise is a problem. The wife's actions of checking his phone are also questionable, but that doesn't justify the lie. \n\nThe key here is that the author broke a promise. Whether the lie was to protect the relationship or not, the act of lying undermines trust. Even if the wife's method of finding out was invasive, the author's deception is still a problem. So, the author is in the wrong for not following through on the promise, even if his intentions were to keep the peace. Therefore, answer A.\n"
