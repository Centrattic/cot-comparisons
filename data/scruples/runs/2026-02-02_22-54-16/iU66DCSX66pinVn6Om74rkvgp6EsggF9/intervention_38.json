A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author was confiding in Liz about her relationship issues. The author's wife misunderstood a text where the author was giving Liz advice to either commit to her girlfriend or end the relationship. The wife took it as Liz wanting to be with the author instead. The author tried to convince the wife that wasn't the case, but she wasn't listening and asked him to stop being friends with Liz. To appease her, the author said he wouldn't, but continued the friendship. Now, the wife found out and is upset because he lied.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author lied about maintaining a friendship, and the wife went through his phone. The question is who's at fault. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author made a promise to the wife to stop being friends with Liz to avoid conflict. If he kept that promise but secretly didn't, that's a lie. Lies in a relationship can be a big deal, especially if it's about something the partner is concerned about. The wife's action of checking his phone is also questionable, as it's an invasion of privacy, but her reason for doing so was because she suspected he was being dishonest.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the initial advice was misunderstood, and he felt pressured to comply with the wife's request even though he thought it was unfair. But lying can erode trust. Even if the wife acted inconsiderately by checking the phone, the author's dishonesty is still a problem. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and breaking promises can lead to bigger issues.\n\nSo, while the wife's method of finding out was wrong, the author's lie is a significant transgression. The fact that he continued the friendship despite promising not to shows a lack of commitment to resolving the issue and respecting his wife's feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
