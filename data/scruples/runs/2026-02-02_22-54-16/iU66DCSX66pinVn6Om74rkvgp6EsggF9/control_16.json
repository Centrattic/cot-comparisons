A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a female coworker named Liz who was in a relationship that turned out bad. The author was confiding in his wife about Liz's situation. During that conversation, the author relayed Liz's text where she was questioning her relationship. The wife misinterpreted the conversation, thinking the author was implying he wanted to have sex with Liz and was badmouthing her. The wife then told the author not to be friends with Liz. The author agreed not to, but then continued to be friends at work. Now the wife found out he's still texting Liz, hence the lie.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not telling his wife he was still in contact with Liz. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA). The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author lied about cutting off contact with Liz, which the wife specifically asked for. Even if the wife was acting out due to her mood, the author kept the secret. But some might argue that the wife invaded privacy by checking his phone. However, the author did lie, which is a breach of trust. In relationships, honesty is important. By not respecting his wife's wishes and lying about their friendship, he might be in the wrong. Even if the wife's method of checking the phone was incorrect, the author's dishonesty is a problem. So the answer would likely be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
