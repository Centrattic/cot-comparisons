A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves lying to his wife about not being friends with a female coworker, Liz, after a conflict. \n\nFirst, the main issue here is the man's dishonesty. He told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, but he kept texting her. Then, his wife found out by checking his phone. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFrom what I read, the husband made a promise to his wife to cut off contact with Liz, which he didn't follow. Even if they stayed just as coworkers, he still lied about not being friends anymore. Honesty is a key component in a marriage, so breaking that trust could be seen as his fault. \n\nThen there's the wife's part. She did go through his phone, which is generally considered an invasion of privacy. However, the husband's lie is still a problem. Even if the wife was acting out of jealousy or moodiness, the husband's actions set off the conflict by lying. \n\nThe wife might be wrong for checking his phone, but the husband's initial lie is a separate issue. The question is whether he's in the wrong, and since he broke his promise, the answer is likely A. But maybe there's a nuance where the wife shouldn't have checked his phone, but the main fault is on the husband's dishonesty. So I think the answer is A.\n"
