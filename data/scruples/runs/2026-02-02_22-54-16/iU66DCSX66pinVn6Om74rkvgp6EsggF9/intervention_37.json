A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz after she got upset. But he kept texting her at work. The wife found out by checking his phone and is upset. The author is wondering if he's the asshole (AITA) for not telling the truth, or if his wife is the problem for snooping.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's side: He made a promise to his wife to stop being friends with Liz, but he didn't keep it. He might have thought it was trivial since they just worked together, but lying about it is a breach of trust. Even if the wife's method of checking the phone was wrong, the author still broke his promise. \n\nOn the wife's side: She asked him to stop being friends with Liz, and he agreed. By lying about it, he's not respecting her wishes. The wife's action of checking the phone is invasive, but it's a reaction to his dishonesty. However, snooping is not okay, but that doesn't justify the lie.\n\nThe key issue here is trust and honesty in the relationship. The author lied, even if the reason was to avoid conflict. Keeping a promise is important. The wife's method was wrong, but the root problem is the author's dishonesty. \n\nSo even if the wife's actions were inconsiderate, the author is still in the wrong for lying. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
