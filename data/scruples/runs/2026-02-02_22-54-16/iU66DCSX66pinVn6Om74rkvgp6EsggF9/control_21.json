  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for lying to my wife?\nHopefully this is not as cut and dry as it may seem. A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a female coworker, Liz, who started dating a girl. Liz's girlfriend was being shady and illegal. The author was texting Liz about this, and in the conversation, he said something that made his wife think Liz wanted a relationship with him. The wife got upset, told him not to be friends with Liz, but he didn't stop. Now, the wife found out he was still texting Liz, so she's angry. The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether keeping a friendship with Liz after promising to stop is a lie. The author initially told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz after she asked him to. But he continued texting her at work. The wife then discovered this deception. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is crucial. If one partner asks the other to stop a certain behavior (like being friends with someone), and the other partner continues but lies about it, that's a breach of trust. The author made a promise to his wife and broke it. Even if he had a reason (like work communication), the lie itself is problematic. \n\nThe wife's actions of checking his phone might be wrong, but that doesn't justify the author's deception. The question is about the author's wrongdoing. Lying about a specific promise to maintain marital harmony is a significant issue. The author should have been honest and perhaps communicated the ongoing necessity of work-related contact instead of lying. \n\nSo, even if the wife's method of checking the phone was invasive, the author's decision to lie and continue the friendship despite the promise is the primary issue here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
