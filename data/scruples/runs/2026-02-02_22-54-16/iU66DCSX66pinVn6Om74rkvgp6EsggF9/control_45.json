A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about lying to his wife about not being friends with a coworker, Liz. The author originally told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore after a conflict, but in reality, he kept being friends with her at work. Now, the wife found out and is upset about the lie and also went through his phone. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author lied about ending his friendship with Liz, even though he still kept in touch. The wife asked him not to be friends with Liz, and he agreed to do so, but didn't follow through. That's a lie by omission, maybe? Or an active lie if he explicitly said he wouldn't and then continued. The user says he \"told her he wouldn't\" and \"stayed friends at work.\" So he lied directly. Then later, when the wife found out, she went through his phone. \n\nNow, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for not telling the truth about still being friends with Liz. The other part is about the wife going through his phone, but the question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, lying to a spouse about something they asked you to do is usually considered wrong. If someone asks you not to do something and you agree but then do it anyway, that's deceitful. Even if the reason is to avoid conflict or because the wife was being unreasonable, the act of lying is still a breach of trust. \n\nThe wife's actions of going through his phone are also questionable, as it's an invasion of privacy. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the wife did something wrong (going through the phone), the author's lie is still his responsibility. \n\nThe author might argue that the wife was being unreasonable about the friendship with Liz, but that doesn't justify lying. The right thing would have been to have an open conversation about the situation instead of lying. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author lied about ending the friendship, which is dishonest. Therefore, he's in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
