A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was texting Liz, a female coworker, and shared some advice with her. His wife misunderstood the conversation, thinking the author was flirting or being disloyal. The wife then told him to stop being friends with Liz. He agreed but didn't actually stop, which led to the wife finding out he was still in contact and confronting him. Now, the author is wondering if he's at fault for lying about cutting off the friendship, or if the wife is in the wrong for checking his phone.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Did the author lie by not cutting off Liz? 2) Is the wife in the wrong for going through his phone?\n\nLooking at the first point, the author promised his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore but continued to text her. That's a clear lie. Honesty in a relationship is usually important, so that's a problem. Even if the wife's actions (like checking the phone) were questionable, the author's deception is still a violation of trust. \n\nNow, the wife's actions: entering his phone without permission is a privacy issue. However, the author's lie is the initial violation. In relationships, both parties have rights to privacy, but if one person is dishonest, the other might feel justified in checking. Still, it's not an excuse for the lie. \n\nThe author's defense might be that the wife was being irrational during her \"moody\" time, but that doesn't justify lying. The core issue is the broken promise and the deceit. Even if the wife's methods (checking the phone) were wrong, the author's actions still contributed to the conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he lied despite promising otherwise. The wife's actions might be a mistake, but the author's dishonesty is the main issue here.\n"
