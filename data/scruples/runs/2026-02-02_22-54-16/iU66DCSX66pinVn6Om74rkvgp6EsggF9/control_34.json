A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nSo, the situation started when the author's coworker, Liz, was dating someone who lied and did shady stuff. Liz confided in the author via texts, and during this, Liz mentioned she hadn't had sex with a guy in two years and was considering ending the relationship. The author told his wife about this conversation, but the wife misinterpreted it, thinking the author was implying he wanted to have a relationship with Liz. The wife then demanded he stop being friends with Liz. To appease her, he said he wouldn't, but he kept texting her at work. Now, the wife found out and is upset because he lied about cutting ties.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the author not being truthful with his wife. He promised not to be friends with Liz anymore but continued texting her. Even if it's just work-related, he didn't disclose that he was still in contact. The wife had a valid reason to be upset because he broke his promise. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and lying about friendships can erode that trust. The wife's actions of checking his phone are also questionable, but the focus here is on the author's actions. \n\nEven if the texts were professional, the author didn't communicate the truth. The wife felt betrayed when she discovered the lie. So, the author's dishonesty is the main problem here. While the wife's method of finding out (checking his phone) is not appropriate, that doesn't excuse the author's lie. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he lied about his actions, the answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong). The wife's actions are separate and not the focus of the question. The core issue is the author's deceit, so he's at fault.\n"
