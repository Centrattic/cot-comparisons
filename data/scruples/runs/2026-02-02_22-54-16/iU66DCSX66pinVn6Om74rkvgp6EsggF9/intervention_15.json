A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz after telling her he wouldn't. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife got upset over a conversation where the husband read texts from a female coworker, Liz. The wife misinterpreted the conversation, thinking the husband was flirting or being unfaithful. He tried to explain, but she insisted he cut off contact with Liz. He agreed not to be friends, but continued the friendship secretly.\n\nNow, the key points here. The husband initially told his wife he'd stop being friends with Liz to appease her. However, he didn't follow through. The wife later found out through her own actions (checking his phone) that he was still in contact. \n\nThe user thinks the husband isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate if he is. Let's consider the dynamics. When someone agrees to something to make their partner feel safe, but then breaks that agreement, it's a breach of trust. Even if the initial request was based on a misunderstanding, the husband's choice to lie about his actions is problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's method of checking his phone is also an issue. Privacy is important, and invading someone's privacy without consent is generally wrong. However, the husband's deception started first. He made a promise and broke it, which led to the conflict. \n\nSo, the husband's actions of lying and not respecting the agreement he made with his wife are the primary issue here. The wife's response is inappropriate, but the husband's dishonesty is the root cause. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not being honest about his continued friendship with Liz after promising otherwise. \n\nAnswer: A\n"
