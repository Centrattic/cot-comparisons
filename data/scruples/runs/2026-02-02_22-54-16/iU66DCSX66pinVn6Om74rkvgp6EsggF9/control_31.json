A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation starts with the author having a conversation with his wife about a coworker, Liz. The wife misunderstood the text messages the author read to her, thinking he was suggesting an affair. She then insisted he stop being friends with Liz. He agreed but continued the friendship secretly.\n\nNow, the wife found out by checking his phone. The author didn't come clean about still being friends with Liz after promising to stop. So, the main issue is about lying to his wife. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is key. Even if the wife's behavior was questionable (like checking his phone), the author still made a promise not to be friends with Liz and broke it. Lying to a spouse is generally considered wrong because it breaks trust. Even if the wife's methods were invasive, the author's deception is still a problem. \n\nThe user might be trying to justify the author's actions by mentioning the wife's moodiness and her checking the phone, but the core issue is the lie. The author's actions could lead to further trust issues. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A). However, the wife's actions aren't without fault either, but the primary question is about the author's wrongdoings. \n\nSo, the answer is A.\n"
