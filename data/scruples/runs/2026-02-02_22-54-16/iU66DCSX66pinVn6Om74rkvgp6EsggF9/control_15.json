A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's the initial conflict where the wife is upset because Liz thought her girlfriend was cheating. The author talks to Liz, which the wife hears about, and she gets the wrong impression. The wife then tells the author not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author agrees to not be friends but continues texting Liz at work. Now the wife finds out by checking his phone and is angry. The author is asking if he's the asshole for lying about not being friends with Liz, or if the wife is wrong for checking his phone.\n\nSo, the key points here are about honesty in a relationship. The author made a promise to his wife to stop being friends with Liz but kept in contact. That's a lie. Even if the wife was being unreasonable (like during her mood), lying about a promise is a big deal. Trust is important in relationships, and breaking a promise can harm that trust. \n\nThen there's the part about the wife checking his phone. In some cases, people might find that invasive, but if the author promised not to contact Liz and she's checking to verify, maybe she feels the need because of past issues. However, that doesn't necessarily make her right to check his phone, but the main issue is the author's dishonesty.\n\nThe author also mentions the wife gets moody and it's \"that time of the month.\" That might be a way to excuse her behavior, but it's not a good reason to be unkind. However, the focus here is on the author's actions. He lied, which is a clear violation of trust. Even if the wife was acting out of jealousy or something, the author should have been honest from the start. \n\nSo, even if the wife's actions (checking the phone) are questionable, the author's lie is the main problem. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
