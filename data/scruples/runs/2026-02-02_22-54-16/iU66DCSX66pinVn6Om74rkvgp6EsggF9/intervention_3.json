A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves lying to his wife about not being friends with a female coworker named Liz. The author had a conversation with Liz where they discussed her relationship issues, and when his wife found out, she got upset and told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author agreed not to, but continued texting her. Later, the wife discovered the texts and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author didn't lie about the content of his conversations with Liz, just about the fact that they were still in contact. The lie was about following through on the promise to cut off contact. The wife went through his phone, which might be a breach of privacy, but that's separate from the author's actions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did make a promise to his wife and broke it. Even if the reason was to maintain a friendship, deception is involved. The wife's anger could be justified because trust is important in a relationship. On the other hand, the wife invading his privacy by checking his phone complicates things. But the author's lie might have been a breach of trust. \n\nThe question is whether the lie makes him the asshole. The answer hinges on whether keeping a friendship is more important than honesty with a spouse. Different people might have different views. However, in relationships, honesty is typically a key component. If the author felt he couldn't be honest, that could indicate a problem in the relationship. But if his actions were to protect his friend's privacy or maintain the friendship, maybe there's nuance. However, the main issue is the deception. The author's actions could be seen as deceitful, which might place the blame on him. But the wife's method of confronting him (checking his phone) is also questionable. \n\nIn terms of the options, the user is asking for A or B. The key is whether the lie is the author's fault. Since he broke the promise, even if the reason was to maintain a friendship, the lie could be considered wrong. So the answer might lean towards A. But some might argue B because the wife also acted inappropriately by checking the phone. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. The primary wrong here is the lie, so A might be correct.\n"
