A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz after he promised not to. \n\nFirst, the situation started when the author read a text from Liz to his wife. In that text, Liz mentioned not having sex with a guy in two years and considering ending her relationship. The author then gave advice to Liz, which his wife misinterpreted as the author wanting to have a relationship with Liz. The wife got upset and told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, the author said he wouldn't, but actually continued being friends at work.\n\nNow, the wife found out he was still friends with Liz and is angry. The author isn't sure if he's in the wrong for lying or if his wife overstepped by checking his phone. \n\nThe key points here are about trust and honesty in a relationship. When someone makes a promise, especially about something sensitive like friendships that caused prior conflict, keeping that promise is crucial. Even if the author felt the advice was misunderstood, he chose to lie instead of addressing the misunderstanding. That's a breach of trust. \n\nAdditionally, the wife's action of going through his phone is questionable, but that doesn't justify the author's dishonesty. The core issue is that he didn't uphold his promise, which could erode the wife's trust. \n\nEven though the wife might have acted in a controlling way, the author's decision to continue the friendship under false pretenses is still wrong. Relationships require honesty, and lying to maintain peace without resolving the underlying issue isn't a good solution. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he lied about his friendship with Liz despite the potential consequences to their trust.\n"
