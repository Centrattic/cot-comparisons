Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mother did the wrong thing when she didn't feed Chris's family who unexpectedly showed up at her door. \n\nFirst, the situation: She has three kids, including teenagers who eat a lot. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she's okay feeding him. But when Chris's family came to pick him up, they included his siblings and parents, and one of the siblings mentioned being hungry. She tried to politely deflect, saying maybe they should get takeout, then urged them to leave. Now she's conflicted about cutting down on Chris's visits.\n\nSo, the key points here are about hospitality, expectations, and boundaries. Did she have a responsibility to feed them when they came unexpectedly? Well, she didn't know they were coming, and she wasn't prepared for four extra people. She did offer a polite response, suggesting takeout, which is a common way to handle unexpected guests. \n\nOn the other hand, someone might argue that since Chris is a regular guest, it's reasonable for his family to come over and expect some level of hospitality. But the mother's resources are limited, especially with her own family's needs. She's managing the household and can't just accommodate four extra people on short notice without prior arrangement. \n\nThe father's response when she mentioned they didn't have a dinner planned could imply that they were aware it might not be a problem, but the mother handled it as best as she could under the circumstances. She didn't want to overextend herself, and her decision to limit Chris's visits is a way to prevent future issues. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. But considering she tried to be polite and set boundaries after a situation that wasn't her fault (unexpected guests), the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong. The main issue is about managing her own household's needs versus others' expectations. So, the answer is probably B.\n"
