Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the mom has three kids, and Chris, a friend of her son, comes over often. She's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's family unexpectedly arrives, she didn't prepare for them and had to send them away. She's now reducing Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her actions were justified. She didn't cook for four extra people, which makes sense because she didn't expect them. The parents said they didn't have dinner planned, which is a bit concerning. The mom's response was polite but firm, which seems reasonable. She's managing her household and her family's needs. \n\nThe key points here are her responsibility to her own family and the unexpected guests. She was clear that she hadn't prepared for them and suggested takeout, which is practical. She's also adjusting the frequency of visits to prevent future issues, which is a proactive step.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents should have communicated better, but the mom isn't at fault for not anticipating their needs. She's not obligated to feed them on short notice. Her actions seem considerate but also in her family's best interest. So I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
