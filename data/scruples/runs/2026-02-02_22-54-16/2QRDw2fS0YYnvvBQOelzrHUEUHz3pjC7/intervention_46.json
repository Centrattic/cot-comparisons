Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, she's a mom with three kids, so cooking a lot already. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's okay feeding him. But when Chris's entire family comes over unannounced, expecting to stay? That's a lot. She wasn't prepared for four extra people. She tried to politely say they should leave to get food, and then suggested they go get takeout. She even reduced the number of visits after that.\n\nNow, the main point is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, maybe she should have offered some food regardless, even if she didn't cook for them. But she wasn't expecting them, and they came without notice. She had to manage her household's needs. Also, their family didn't have money, so maybe they were hoping for a free meal. But that's not her responsibility. She's not obligated to feed everyone who comes to her door. She was polite and gave them an alternative. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a cultural expectation of hospitality, but she's not in a position to host unexpected guests. She's a single mom with teenagers, which is a lot. She did what she could, and when they came uninvited, she handled it as best as she could. She even adjusted her son's visits to prevent future issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think she's in the right. She's taking care of her family's needs and managing her resources. The family came unannounced and expected more than she could offer. She wasn't rude, just firm. So answer B.\n"
