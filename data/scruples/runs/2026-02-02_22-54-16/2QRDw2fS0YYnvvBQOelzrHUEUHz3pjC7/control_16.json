Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they came over unannounced. She has three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's okay with feeding him occasionally. But when Chris's whole family showed up, she didn't prepare for them.\n\nSo, she tried to be polite by saying they probably have dinner planned. The dad said \"not really,\" which is awkward. She then suggested takeout and sent them on their way. Now she's reducing the visits from four to one a week and considering her son to meet Chris elsewhere or at his house.\n\nHmm. The key points here are her responsibility to her own family and the unexpected guests. She didn't have the meal prepared for four more people, which might have been a last-minute thing. The family of Chris just showed up without notice, making it hard for her to adjust. She handled it politely, maybe a bit awkwardly, but it's understandable given the situation.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she was being kind to Chris but wasn't obligated to feed his entire family. The family didn't ask in advance, so she couldn't plan. Her reaction of suggesting takeout and closing the door makes sense to protect her own family's routine. She's a mom managing a lot, and it's reasonable to set boundaries. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
