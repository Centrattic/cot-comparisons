Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the mom did the wrong thing when she refused to feed Chris's family. So, here's the situation: she has three kids, which already means a lot of cooking. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she's happy to feed him. But when Chris's entire family shows up unannounced, she wasn't prepared for four more people. She tried to politely decline, but the parents said they weren't really going to have dinner. She then told them to get takeout and send the kids somewhere else, and now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom with three teenagers and a preteen. That's a lot of mouths to feed already. The family situation of Chris is mentioned as not well off, but that's not the same as being in a dire situation where they can't cook a meal. The parents did say they weren't planning dinner, which could mean they hadn't prepared anything. But the mom wasn't expecting four extra people, so she didn't cook for them. \n\nHer actions: she tried to be diplomatic, suggested takeout, and urged them to leave. She then decided to limit her son's visits with Chris to avoid similar situations. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, from her perspective, she's managing her household and resources. She didn't have the means or expectation to feed four more people. But Chris's family is in a financial hardship. However, the parents' response (\"not really\") might indicate that they were looking for a handout. She's not obligated to feed them, especially if they came uninvited. On the other hand, she's in a position where she can offer help, but she chose not to, which might make her feel guilty. \n\nBut wait, the key here is that the family came unannounced. If they had known in advance, maybe they could have arranged. The mom isn't responsible for their situation. She's being reasonable in her own home. But maybe there's a social expectation to help in such a case. However, the parents didn't ask for food; they just mentioned being hungry. She's not in the wrong for not anticipating their needs. She's not obligated to feed everyone who comes through her door. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's managing her household and resources, and the family came unannounced. She tried to be polite but firm. It's understandable that she doesn't want to be in that situation again.\n"
