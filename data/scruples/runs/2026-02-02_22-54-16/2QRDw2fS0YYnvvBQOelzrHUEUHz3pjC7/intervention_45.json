Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the mother is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's cooking a lot for her three kids, and she's used to feeding her son's friend Chris when he comes over. But then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly, asking to pick him up, and the mom ends up having four extra people at her doorstep. The parents say they weren't planning dinner, and the mom didn't prepare for them, so she politely but firmly sends them away. Now she's cutting down on how often Chris comes over or visiting his house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's perspective. She's already cooking enough for her own family, and when she didn't know Chris's family would come, she didn't prepare extra food. She tried to be polite, even suggesting they get takeout and urging them to leave because the kids were hungry. She feels she's doing the right thing by her family but is worried she's being unkind. \n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a difficult situation financially. They might not have enough food, so when they saw an opportunity to get a meal, they might have expected to be offered. But they didn't ask in advance, and the mother wasn't prepared. It's possible that the family didn't realize the mother wasn't expecting them. However, the father did mention they weren't really planning dinner, which might indicate they were hoping the mother would offer something.\n\nThe key points here are unexpected guests, lack of prior communication, and the mother's responsibility to her own family. The mother made it clear she wasn't prepared to feed them, and she didn't treat them poorly. She even suggested an alternative (takeout) and encouraged them to leave. So from a social standpoint, she handled it politely. \n\nBut morally, is she at fault? Well, she didn't have a duty to feed them since they didn't ask beforehand. She was already managing her own family's needs. The problem arises if the family expected her to take responsibility for their dinner without notice. However, she tried to be accommodating by suggesting takeout, which isn't a bad solution. \n\nThe mother's decision to reduce the visits might be seen as a way to avoid similar situations in the future. While it's a bit harsh, it's understandable given the circumstances. She's not being unkind, just setting boundaries for her own household. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the mother isn't in the wrong. She handled the situation as best as she could under the circumstances, prioritizing her family's needs and managing the unexpected situation with what she had. The answer should be B.\n"
