Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. She's a mom of three kids, cooking a lot already. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's okay with feeding him when he comes over. But when Chris's family showed up unexpectedly, she didn't prepare for them. \n\nShe tried to be polite by saying she's sure their parents have dinner planned. When the father says \"not really,\" she tells them to get takeout and ushers them out. Then she decides to limit Chris's visits. \n\nThe key points here are her responsibility and the unexpected guests. She wasn't expecting four more people, so it's understandable that she didn't cook for them. She might be stretched thin with her own family. Her response was firm but polite, maybe even diplomatic. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she should have offered something, even if it's leftovers or a simple snack. But she did acknowledge their hunger and suggested takeout, which they could have done. Also, she made it clear she wasn't responsible for feeding them. \n\nThe mother's feelings of guilt are valid, but she's also prioritizing her family's needs. The situation isn't her fault, especially since the guests showed up uninvited. She's within her rights to set boundaries. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
