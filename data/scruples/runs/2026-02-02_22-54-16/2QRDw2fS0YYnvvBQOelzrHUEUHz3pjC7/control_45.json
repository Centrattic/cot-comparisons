Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mother did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they came over unannounced. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: she has three kids, which already means she's cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son's, and he comes over often. But then Chris's family\u2014parents and two siblings\u2014show up unexpectedly. They mention the food smells good and are hungry. She didn't plan to feed four more people, so she responds politely but makes them leave, suggesting takeout. After that, she limits Chris's visits to once a week or suggests he meet elsewhere.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me consider different angles.\n\nFrom the mother's perspective: She's responsible for her own family's meals. She didn't expect four extra guests, and she's already cooking a lot. She tried to be diplomatic but couldn't offer a meal. It's a common situation where people might not realize the effort involved in feeding others. Her reaction might be about not wanting to be taken advantage of or overwhelmed.\n\nFrom the other side: Chris's family might be in a tough financial situation, as mentioned. They might have thought it's normal to accept a meal if it's offered. The father's nonchalant \"not really\" could be seen as dismissive, but the mother's response was firm. Also, the mother is cutting down the visits, which might affect Chris's social life with her son.\n\nCultural expectations might play a role here. In some cultures, offering food to guests is expected, but if it's a surprise, it's different. However, the mother had already established a pattern with Chris, but the family's sudden arrival might be a one-time thing.\n\nThe key points are: Did she have an obligation to feed them? She didn't plan for them, so maybe not. She was polite and suggested takeout, which is a solution. However, the way she ushered them out might come off as abrupt. But considering her family's needs, she's protecting her own resources.\n\nAlso, her decision to limit visits is about her household's comfort. While it might affect Chris, she's not necessarily wrong in prioritizing her own family's well-being. People have limits, and it's reasonable to set boundaries, especially when uninvited guests create stress.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B, the mother is not in the wrong. She handled it as best as she could given the circumstances without being rude, while protecting her household's needs.\n"
