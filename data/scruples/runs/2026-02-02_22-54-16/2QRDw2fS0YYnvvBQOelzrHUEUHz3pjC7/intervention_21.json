Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the mom feeds her own kids and occasionally feeds Chris, a friend of her son. Then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly, and she's not prepared to feed them all. She politely tells them they should go get takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The mom is already cooking for her own family, which includes three kids. She's feeding Chris when he comes over, but she didn't prepare for four additional people. When Chris's family arrives without notice, she's not responsible for feeding them. Her response was to suggest takeout and to move along, which seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but they want my opinion. Let's break it down. Is it wrong to not feed unexpected guests? Probably not. She didn't know they were coming, so she couldn't have prepared. The parents even said they didn't have dinner planned, so maybe they were relying on her, but that's not her responsibility. She made it clear that she wasn't going to feed them more than what was planned. \n\nAlso, the mom adjusted by reducing the frequency of Chris's visits, which shows she's trying to be accommodating but also setting boundaries. The father's comment \"not really\" and looking away might indicate that they knew they were being a bit presumptuous. The mom's actions were to protect her resources and her time, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about expectations and boundaries. The mom set clear boundaries by not preparing for more people and handling the situation politely. The family showed up unannounced, which isn't her fault. She didn't have to feed them, and her response was firm but courteous. So, the answer would likely be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
