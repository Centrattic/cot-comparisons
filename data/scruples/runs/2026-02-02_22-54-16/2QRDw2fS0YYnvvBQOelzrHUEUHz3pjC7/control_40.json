Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is a mom with three kids\u2014teenagers and a preteen. They eat a lot, so she's cooking a lot. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's whole family (parents and two siblings) came to pick him up, they were on the doorstep, mentioned they were hungry, and the author didn't offer them food. She told them to get takeout and suggested they leave quickly. Now she's telling her son to reduce the visits or maybe meet elsewhere because she doesn't want more last-minute guests like that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she did something wrong. Let's break it down. She was cooking for her own family, and Chris is a regular guest, so she's used to feeding him. But when Chris's entire family showed up unexpectedly, she wasn't prepared to host them. The family noticed the food smell and mentioned being hungry. She tried to avoid the situation by saying maybe they can get takeout and urged them to leave. Then she decided to limit Chris's visits to avoid this again.\n\nIs she wrong? Well, it's important to consider her perspective. She's a mom with three teenagers, so the workload of cooking is already significant. If she didn't know Chris's family was coming, it's reasonable that she couldn't prepare for four extra people. She might be under stress, and suddenly having four more people to feed could be overwhelming. She tried to handle the situation politely by not directly refusing but suggesting takeout and moving them along.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have offered something. But how much is she obligated to feed others? Chris is a friend of her son, so she's been feeding him when he comes over. But Chris's family isn't her responsibility. She's under no obligation to feed them, especially if it's a last-minute thing. The parents of Chris might not have realized the situation and could have prepped their own food. The author did her best to be diplomatic. She didn't make them feel unwelcome but set a boundary. \n\nSome people might say she was rude for not offering, but others would understand that she's managing her household and can't just accommodate unexpected large groups. Her main duty is to her own family, and she's already stretched thin with cooking for three kids. Limiting the visits after that is her way of protecting her own family's needs and her own time. \n\nThe key points here are: she's feeding Chris as a regular guest, but the family visit was unexpected. She handled it as best as she could without confrontation. The parents didn't plan, so maybe the problem is more on their side for not bringing food for their kids. The author isn't in the wrong for not preparing for a large, last-minute group. Her decision to reduce visits is about managing her household, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
