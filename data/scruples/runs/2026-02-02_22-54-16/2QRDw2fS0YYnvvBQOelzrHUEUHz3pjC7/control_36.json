Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is the parent of three kids and often cooks a lot. Chris, the friend of her son, visits often, and she's okay with feeding him. But last week, Chris's family showed up unexpectedly with two siblings. They mentioned the food smelled good, and one sibling said they were hungry. The parent said they probably have dinner planned, but the father said they didn't. The parent then suggested takeout and sent them away. Now she's feeling conflicted because she's reducing Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she's in the wrong. She had no prior knowledge of four extra people coming over. She was already cooking for her family and a few guests. Inviting four more without notice would be a lot. She handled it politely, trying to be diplomatic. She even offered a solution by suggesting takeout, which is a kind gesture. However, she did send them away, which might seem harsh. But given the circumstances, she wasn't obligated to feed them. The father knew they weren't prepared and didn't ask beforehand. The mother's reaction to limit future visits is understandable to avoid similar situations. The key points here are the unexpectedness, the lack of prior communication, and the parent's polite but firm response. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
