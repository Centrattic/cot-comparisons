Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris' family when they unexpectedly showed up. \n\nFirst, she's a mom of three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's okay feeding him. But when Chris' family comes over unannounced with two siblings, the situation changes. She didn't prepare for four extra people. The family comments on the food smell and says they're hungry.\n\nShe responds by saying she's sure their parents have dinner planned and suggests takeout. When the dad says \"not really,\" she tells them to get moving. Then she limits how often Chris can come over. \n\nNow, considering the situation: she's already managing her own family's needs. Unexpected guests can be a burden, especially if food wasn't planned. She didn't want to feed them, which is understandable. But maybe she could have offered food in a different way? Like sending them to get takeout or offering leftovers. But she did suggest takeout, so maybe that's enough. \n\nHer actions were polite but firm. She's setting boundaries for her family's comfort. The father's response was dismissive, which might have influenced her reaction. She's not obligated to feed them, especially without prior notice. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have handled it more gracefully. But ultimately, she's not the one at fault here. The family showed up uninvited and took advantage of the situation. The mom is protecting her resources and family's well-being. So the answer should be B.\n"
