Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom in the situation is in the wrong. She has three kids, two teens and a preteen. She's cooking a lot already, and Chris, her son's friend, comes over often. Then Chris's family shows up unannounced, expecting to stay and eat. She didn't plan for them, so she politely turns them away. Now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom managing a household with teenagers who eat a lot. Chris's family shows up unexpectedly without prior notice. She didn't cook for them, so when they comment on the food, she's being honest when she says she didn't plan for them. She's polite but firm, suggesting they go get takeout. Then she decides to limit visits between her son and Chris to avoid future issues.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's within her rights to not host unexpected guests. It's reasonable to expect that when someone brings a friend over, they aren't bringing their entire family unannounced. The problem here might be that the parents didn't communicate their plans, but the mom is just protecting her own home and resources. She's not obligated to feed people who show up without notice. She handled it politely, so there's no rudeness involved. The fact that Chris's family is poor isn't her fault, and she's not refusing help out of spite. She's just managing her own household. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
