Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom who's been feeding her son's friends, including Chris. Now, Chris's family showed up unexpectedly with four people, and the mom didn't prepare to feed them. She politely tried to send them away, then reduced the number of visits. She's feeling conflicted about it.\n\nFirst, the situation: The mom is cooking for her own family, which is already a lot with three kids. Chris comes over often, and she's been feeding him. But when his family arrives unannounced, expecting food, she's not prepared. She tries to handle it politely, but it's a last-minute thing. She then decides to limit Chris's visits.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's managing her household and resources. She didn't invite the family, right? They showed up expecting to use her bathroom and eat, which she wasn't prepared for. She responded by saying she didn't cook for them and suggested they get takeout. Then she's cutting back on Chris's visits. \n\nOn one hand, she's being considerate by feeding Chris when he's there. On the other, the family just showed up without notice. She's not obligated to feed people who didn't tell her they were coming. Maybe she should have set boundaries earlier, but the family's actions were unexpected. \n\nThe key points here: Did she have a prior agreement to feed Chris's family? No. Did she know they were coming? No. She's handling it politely but setting a boundary. The parents didn't seem to respect her space or ask if they could stay for a meal. \n\nI think she's in the right. She's not in the wrong for not feeding people who didn't make arrangements. She's managing her home and resources. The parents should have communicated better. So the answer is B.\n"
