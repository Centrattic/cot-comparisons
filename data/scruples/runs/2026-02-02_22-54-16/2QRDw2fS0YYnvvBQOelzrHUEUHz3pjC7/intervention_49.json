Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the mom is in the wrong here. So, she's a mom of three kids, which is already a lot. She's cooking a lot because teenagers eat a lot. Then Chris, her son's friend, comes over often. Chris isn't well off, so she's happy to feed him. But last week, Chris's parents and siblings showed up unexpectedly. They came to pick him up, but one sibling needed the bathroom and they commented on how nice the house and food smell. The parents said they weren't planning dinner, and the mom had to politely turn them away, suggesting takeout since she wasn't cooking for four extra people.\n\nThe mom feels conflicted because she did the right thing for her family but also feels bad. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I should consider the unexpected guests situation. Hosts often have the right to control their home environment. If someone shows up uninvited with multiple family members, especially when the host isn't prepared, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The mom wasn't expecting four people, so not having food for them makes sense. She tried to be polite and suggested takeout, which is a kind response.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a tough spot financially, as mentioned. But the problem here is that they came unannounced. The mom isn't obligated to feed people just because they're in a difficult situation. She was already responsible for her own family's meals. The parents might have expected her to accommodate them, but that's not fair if it wasn't arranged beforehand. \n\nThe mom's decision to limit how often Chris comes over or suggest he goes to his own house is her way of managing her resources and time. It's about setting boundaries to avoid similar situations. She's not being mean; she's being practical. The father's comment \"not really\" implies they might rely on others, which isn't the mom's responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all that, the mom isn't in the wrong. She handled it politely, made a logical decision for her family, and took steps to prevent future issues. The answer should be B.\n"
