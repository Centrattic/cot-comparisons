Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding the extra four people who showed up unannounced. So the situation is that her son's friend Chris comes over often, and now Chris's family showed up unexpectedly, including the parents and two siblings. The family members were hungry, and the mom didn't have food prepared for them. She tried to politely suggest that they might have dinner planned, then when the dad said they didn't, she told them to get takeout and shooed them out. Now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids, including teens and a preteen, so cooking already takes a lot of time and resources. Chris's family is less well-off, so they might be in a tough spot. But they showed up unannounced, expecting to eat, which the mom wasn't prepared for. She did mention she's happy to feed Chris, but not his whole family.\n\nHer response was diplomatic, but maybe not enough. She was polite at first, then when the dad said they didn't have food planned, she pushed them out. But maybe she could have offered something else? Like a simple meal or even a snack, not the full dinner they had planned. However, she might not have the resources to do that regularly if Chris's family keeps coming unexpectedly. The mom is trying to manage her household's needs and her own stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might have been in a desperate situation, needing food, and the mom's reaction could be seen as dismissive. Her son's friend's family might feel embarrassed or judged, especially if they came for help. But the mom isn't obligated to feed people who show up unannounced without prior notice. She made her position clear, and the dad didn't have a plan, so takeout was the suggestion.\n\nThe key points are whether the mom acted unkindly or inconsiderately. She was polite, set boundaries, and managed the situation without being rude. She also adjusted her son's visits to prevent future issues. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she's respecting her own limits and family's needs. However, there's a nuance in how the situation could have been handled more compassionately. But given the suddenness and that it was a one-time occurrence, she might not be at fault. The answer would be B (No).\n"
