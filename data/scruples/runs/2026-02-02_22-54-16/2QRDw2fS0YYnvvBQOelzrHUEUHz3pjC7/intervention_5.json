Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding the four unexpected guests from Chris's family.\n\nFirst, the context: She's a mom of three teenagers/preteens, which means she's already cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's family shows up unannounced with two siblings, she didn't prepare for four extra people. She tried to politely suggest that maybe they should get takeout instead of staying. Then she cut the visits down because she doesn't want that situation again.\n\nThe key points here are intention and communication. She didn't know they were coming, so it's understandable she wasn't prepared. She handled it politely, even offering an alternative. The father's response was dismissive, but she still maintained her ground. \n\nI think the main issue is about boundaries. She's not obligated to feed people who show up without notice. While it's kind that she's feeding Chris, the sudden increase in guests without prior notice is a lot to handle, especially with her own family's needs. Setting limits here is reasonable. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's adjusting the frequency of visits to prevent similar situations suggests she wants to be considerate but also needs to manage her household. It's a balancing act between being hospitable and maintaining her own household's well-being. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, she's not in the wrong). She handled it as best as she could under the circumstances, and setting boundaries is necessary here. The father's comment about not having dinner planned might imply they expected her to take them in, but she's not responsible for their lack of planning.\n"
