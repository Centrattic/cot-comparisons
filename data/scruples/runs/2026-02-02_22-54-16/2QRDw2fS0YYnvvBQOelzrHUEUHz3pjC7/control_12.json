Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a mom with three kids, and she's cooking a lot. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. Then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with two siblings, and she didn't prepare for them. She tried to handle it by saying her parents probably have dinner planned and then told them to take out. Now she's feeling conflicted because she's reducing Chris's visits.\n\nHmm. First, I need to assess if she did something wrong. The key points here are about her responsibility and the expectations of the guests. She wasn't expecting four extra people, so she didn't cook for them. She politely redirected them. But maybe the problem is that Chris's family might have been in a tough spot, and she didn't offer help. However, the mom was upfront about not preparing for them, and she's managing her household's needs. She also adjusted by limiting Chris's visits to avoid future issues. \n\nIs it her fault that they came unannounced? The family might have known she wasn't prepared. But maybe there's a social expectation to offer food regardless. However, the mom has her own family's needs and wasn't in a position to accommodate last-minute guests. She handled it politely, so maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure. Also, the father said \"not really\" when she mentioned dinner plans, which might have been a red flag. She then suggested takeout and ushered them out, which is reasonable. The mom's actions were to protect her own family's meal plans, and she's adjusting future interactions. So I think she's not in the wrong.\n"
