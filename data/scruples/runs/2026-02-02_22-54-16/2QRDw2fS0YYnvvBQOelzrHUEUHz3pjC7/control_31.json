Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mom in the situation is wrong for not feeding the additional four people when they came over. \n\nFirst, she's a mom of three kids, so cooking is already a big task. She's feeding her own family and sometimes her son's friend Chris. When Chris's family suddenly shows up with two siblings, maybe she wasn't expecting to feed them. She politely said that she didn't have dinner planned for them and suggested takeout. Then she asked them to leave because the kids were hungry. \n\nNow, considering her perspective, she's responsible for her own family's meals. Maybe she hadn't prepared extra food, so adding four more people would be a burden. She handled it politely, right? She didn't say \"no\" harshly but suggested takeout and urged them to leave. \n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a situation where they can't afford takeout, and the parents might not have the means to prepare a meal. The mom might have an obligation as a host, but she didn't know they were coming. She might not have the resources to feed more people on short notice. \n\nI think she's in the right because she handled it with diplomacy and set boundaries. She's not obligated to feed unexpected guests, especially when it's not her responsibility. The answer is B.\n"
