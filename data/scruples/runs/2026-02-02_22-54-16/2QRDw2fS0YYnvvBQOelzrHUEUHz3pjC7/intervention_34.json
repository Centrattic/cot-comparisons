Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. The situation involves her making dinner for her own kids and occasionally feeding Chris when he comes over. When Chris's family arrived unannounced with four people, she declined to feed them, telling them to get takeout instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a single mom with three kids, so her resources are stretched. She's already cooking a lot for her own family. Chris's family is poor, but that doesn't obligate her to feed them. The parents even said they weren't planning a dinner, which might imply they expected her to offer something.\n\nBut she didn't cook for them, and she politely suggested takeout. Her response seems reasonable given that she wasn't expecting them. She also adjusted by limiting Chris's visits to reduce the possibility of similar situations. \n\nThe key points here are her responsibility to her own family versus the unexpected guests. She's not obligated to feed others when she hasn't planned for it. The fact that Chris's family is poor doesn't necessarily mean she's at fault for not accommodating them without prior notice. However, some might argue that kindness is important, but the mother's boundaries are also valid. \n\nI think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong because she's managing her household and resources as she sees fit. She handled the situation politely and took steps to prevent future issues. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
