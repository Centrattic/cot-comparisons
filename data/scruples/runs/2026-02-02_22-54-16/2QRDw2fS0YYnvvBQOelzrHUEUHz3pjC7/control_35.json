Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding the four additional people from Chris's family when they showed up unannounced. \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The mom has three kids, two teenagers and a preteen. She's already cooking a lot for her own family. Chris is a friend of her son who comes over often, and the mom is okay feeding him. But when Chris's family showed up unexpectedly, including parents and two siblings, she was not prepared to feed them. \n\nThe mom tried to be diplomatic by saying she didn't cook for them and suggested they get takeout. She then urged them to leave because the kids were hungry. After that, she reduced the number of visits from four to one per week and considered having her son meet Chris elsewhere. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the family showed up uninvited, and the mom wasn't expecting four extra people. She had to cook for her own kids, so it's reasonable she wasn't prepared. She didn't want to feed them and felt it was their responsibility. Her reaction was polite but firm. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family was in a tough spot financially, as mentioned. But the mom isn't responsible for feeding them unless she invited them. The father's comment that they \"have no plans\" might imply they expected her to feed them, but she already made it clear she wasn't set up for that. \n\nI think the key points are that the guests came unannounced, she didn't cook for them, and she handled it politely. She's not obligated to feed people who show up without notice. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
