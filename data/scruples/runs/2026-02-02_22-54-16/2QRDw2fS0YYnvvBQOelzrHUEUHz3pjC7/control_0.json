  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not feeding everyone else\nI am a mom of two teenagers and one preteen. Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mom who's cooking for her family and a friend of her son. When the friend's family shows up unexpectedly, she politely tells them she didn't prepare for them and kind of shooed them out. Now she feels guilty but also justified.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is how the mom handled the situation. She made a polite comment about their dinner plans and suggested takeout. Then when the father said they didn't have one, she pushed them to leave. Her actions were firm but not hostile. She even tried to be diplomatic. \n\nThe key points here are whether she was inconsiderate. She didn't have the means to feed four extra people on short notice. Her family's needs come first. It's reasonable to expect guests to communicate their needs in advance. The family showed up without warning, which is a problem. \n\nAlso, the mom's follow-up with her son to reduce the visits is a proactive step to prevent future issues. That makes sense. She's managing her household's resources. The user might be wondering if she was too harsh, but given the context of unexpected guests and limited preparation, her actions seem justified. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a cultural expectation here. In some cultures, hospitality is expected even for unexpected guests. But the mom didn't have the resources. She's single-handedly managing a household with three kids. It's a lot. She can't be expected to host multiple families without prior notice. \n\nThe father's response of \"not really\" and looking away might indicate they are in a tough spot, but the mom can't be responsible for that. It's not her fault. Her actions were within her right to protect her family's resources. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. She handled it as best as she could given the circumstances. The guilt she feels is probably from societal pressures about being a generous host, but realistically, she's doing what's necessary for her family.\n"
