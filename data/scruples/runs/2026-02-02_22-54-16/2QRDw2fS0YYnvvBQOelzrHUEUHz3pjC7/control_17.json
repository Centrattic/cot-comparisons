Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom with three kids, so cooking a lot is part of her routine. She has Chris, a son's friend who's not well off, visiting often. She's okay feeding him because he's a regular. But when Chris's whole family shows up unexpectedly, including four people, she didn't plan to feed them. She made a polite excuse, and after the interaction, she decided to limit Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, consider her perspective. She's managing a household with teenagers who eat a lot. Having unexpected guests, especially four, when she didn't prepare for them could create a burden. She tried to handle it diplomatically by saying her family has dinner planned and suggested takeout. She didn't want to be rude but also needed to protect her family's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the family came expecting to pick up Chris but didn't anticipate being fed. The father's response was non-committal, but the mom's reaction was to cut down visits. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFactors to consider: She didn't invite them, they showed up unannounced. She tried to be polite and not make them feel bad. The family didn't ask to eat, but the comment about the smell might have implied hunger. However, it's not her responsibility to feed people she didn't know would come. She's prioritizing her family's comfort and needs.\n\nThe answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because she didn't have an obligation to feed the unexpected guests. However, there's a slight nuance in that maybe she could have offered something small if they were leaving, but since they were just picking up Chris, taking them to get takeout might not be her responsibility. Her decision to limit visits is about managing her resources and time, which is reasonable.\n"
