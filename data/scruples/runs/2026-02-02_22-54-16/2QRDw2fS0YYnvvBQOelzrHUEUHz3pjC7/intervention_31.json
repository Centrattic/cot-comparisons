Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a mom who didn't feed Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. She had already prepared for Chris, but the family came over and she wasn't expecting them. The key points are her being a single parent with three kids, the financial aspect of Chris's family, and her reaction to the unexpected guests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom is already cooking a lot for her own teenagers. She's happy to feed Chris when he comes over, but when his entire family shows up without notice, she wasn't planning for that. She tried to politely decline by saying the parents probably had dinner planned, then suggested takeout and urged them to leave. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, she's not obligated to feed people who show up unannounced. It's her home, and she's managing her own resources. Even though Chris's family is poor, that doesn't mean she has to host them. However, some might argue that she should have been more hospitable, especially since she was already feeding Chris. But others might see her as being realistic about her situation and prioritizing her own family's needs.\n\nThe mom's actions seem reasonable given the circumstances. She didn't want to overextend herself. The family came uninvited, and she wasn't prepared for four extra people. She didn't act out of malice; she tried to be polite and even offered takeout. The fact that she's adjusting her son's interactions with Chris to avoid future issues shows she's trying to manage the situation without being hostile.\n\nOn the other hand, some might feel that she could have been more accommodating, especially considering Chris's family's financial situation. But again, it's not her responsibility to feed them. The father's comment about not having a dinner plan adds pressure, but the mom had no obligation to cover that. She handled it discreetly without making a scene.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She acted in her family's best interest and managed the situation as best as she could under the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
