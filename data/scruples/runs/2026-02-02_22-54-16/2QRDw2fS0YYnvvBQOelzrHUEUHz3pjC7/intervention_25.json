Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the author is a mom with three kids, cooking a lot for her family. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, which she's okay with. Then Chris's family comes to pick him up, and there are four people at the door. The family comments on the nice food smell and how hungry they are. The author didn't prepare for them, so she politely suggests they should go get takeout and ushers them out. After that, she tells her son to limit Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's a mom juggling a lot, cooking for her own family. She didn't expect four extra guests, so she wasn't prepared. Her response was polite but firm, and she made a decision to limit future visits. She's feeling conflicted because she wants to help but also doesn't want to be taken advantage of.\n\nNow, the other side: Chris's family might be in a tough financial situation. They came to pick up Chris, not expecting a dinner invitation. The parent's comment \"not really\" when asked about dinner could be a plea for help, but maybe they were trying to make small talk. The author's response was to push them out, which might feel dismissive. However, the author had the right to set boundaries, especially since she wasn't prepared.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she didn't offer food, but she also wasn't obligated to. She handled it politely and later adjusted her son's interactions to prevent similar situations. Her actions were about protecting her own family's needs. On the other hand, maybe she could have offered to share a meal or some food, even if she wasn't cooking for them. But considering the last-minute nature and the number of people, it's understandable she wasn't prepared.\n\nThe key points are intention and context. The author didn't have a duty to feed them, especially since they were there for a different purpose. She set boundaries, which is reasonable. Feeling guilty is natural, but she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her family's situation.\n"
