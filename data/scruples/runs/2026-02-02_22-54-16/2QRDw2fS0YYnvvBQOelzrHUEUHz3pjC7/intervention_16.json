Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they came over. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a mom with three kids, which probably means she's busy cooking a lot already. Chris, the son's friend, comes over often, and the author is okay with feeding him. But when Chris's family\u2014parents and two siblings\u2014show up unexpectedly, she wasn't prepared to feed four more people. She tried to be polite but wasn't about to cook for them on short notice. The father said they weren't really planning dinner, and the author suggested takeout and urged them to leave. Now she's feeling conflicted about limiting Chris's visits.\n\nI need to decide if she's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. She's under no obligation to feed unexpected guests. She's managing a household with multiple teenagers, which is a big task. The family came unannounced, and she didn't cook for them. Her response was polite but firm, which makes sense. She's also setting boundaries to prevent similar situations in the future. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family was in a tough spot financially, and she could have offered some help. But she didn't have the resources or time at that moment. It's about respecting her own needs versus the guests' needs. She wasn't rude, just honest about her situation. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong. People can't be expected to accommodate unexpected guests when they're not prepared. Setting boundaries is important, especially when managing a household with kids. She handled it diplomatically and is now adjusting to avoid future issues. The father's response was a bit dismissive, but the author did what she could under the circumstances.\n"
