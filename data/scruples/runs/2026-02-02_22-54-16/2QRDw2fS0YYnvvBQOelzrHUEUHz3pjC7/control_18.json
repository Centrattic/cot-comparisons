Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mom who had a guest's family unexpectedly show up, and she didn't want to feed them. She reduced the number of visits from her son's friend. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The mom is responsible for feeding her own teenagers. Chris's family came over unannounced, and the mom wasn't prepared for four extra people. She tried to politely suggest they go get takeout. Then she decided to limit her son's visits with Chris. \n\nI should consider the key points: The mom didn't cook for them, she tried to be diplomatic, the family wasn't invited, and she's adjusting the visits to avoid similar situations. The main issue is whether she's being unreasonable by not feeding them and cutting down visits.\n\nPossible angles: Her responsibility is to her own family. She wasn't obligated to feed the uninvited guests. However, maybe she could have handled the situation more gracefully. But she did acknowledge the situation and offered a polite response. The part about reducing visits might be seen as punitive. Maybe the family's financial situation is a factor, but the mom isn't responsible for their circumstances. \n\nIs she wrong for prioritizing her family? Probably not. But the way she handled it\u2014ushering them out\u2014might be seen as harsh. However, she did try to be diplomatic. The reduction in visits might be a way to prevent future issues, which could be seen as necessary for her own family's well-being. \n\nSo, weighing it all, the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong) because she's within her rights to not feed uninvited guests and adjust her son's social plans to manage her household. The situation is complex, but the mom's actions are reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
