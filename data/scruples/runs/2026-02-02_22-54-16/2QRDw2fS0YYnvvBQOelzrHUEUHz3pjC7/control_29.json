Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris' family when they showed up unannounced. So, the situation is that Chris is a friend of her son, and she's okay with feeding him when he comes over. But when his whole family shows up, including parents and siblings, without prior notice, she didn't prepare for them. She tried to politely suggest they go get takeout instead of staying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom of three kids, cooking a lot already. She's happy to feed Chris, but when four more people show up unexpectedly, it's a bigger burden. She didn't cook for them, so she's being honest about that. The father said they don't have dinner planned, which might be a problem. The mom then tells them to get takeout and sends them on their way. After that, she limits Chris' visits to prevent this from happening again.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's managing her household and resources. She didn't have prior notice, so expecting her to feed four extra people might be unreasonable. On the other hand, maybe the family was in a difficult situation, and she had a chance to help. But the dad didn't ask for help; he just said they don't have dinner, which might imply they need to find something else. The mom then suggests takeout, which is an option they can choose, but she's not obligated to feed them.\n\nThe key points here are: Did she have a responsibility to feed them? Since they showed up unannounced and she didn't prepare, she's not at fault for not having food ready. She tried to be polite and offer an alternative. Also, she's protecting her family's resources. Limiting Chris' visits is her choice to avoid future stress. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural expectation or a sense of hospitality that she should have offered something. However, the family didn't ask for food; they just mentioned smelling food and being hungry. She didn't invite them to stay for dinner. So she's not in the wrong. The father's response of \"not really\" might indicate they know they can't expect a meal. The mom's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
