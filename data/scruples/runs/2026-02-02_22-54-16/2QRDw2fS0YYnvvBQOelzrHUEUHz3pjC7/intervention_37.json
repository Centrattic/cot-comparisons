Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mother is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. She had prepared food for her own family and the son's friend, but when the friend's whole family came, she didn't cook for them. She told them to get takeout instead. Now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom with three kids, so her time and resources are stretched already. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's been feeding him when he comes over. But when Chris's family showed up unannounced, expecting to eat, that's different. She didn't plan to feed four extra people. The father said they weren't really going to have dinner, which adds to the problem. She tried to be polite by suggesting takeout and then asked them to leave because the kids were hungry. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, she's not obligated to feed them. They came without notice, and she had no way of knowing. The family even commented on how nice the food smells, which might imply they expected to eat, but that's not necessarily her responsibility. She handled it politely, which is important. \n\nBut then she reduced the number of visits from Chris. That might seem harsh, but maybe she feels overwhelmed. The key here is whether her actions were reasonable. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her own family's needs. People can't be expected to accommodate unexpected guests, especially if it's not their responsibility. \n\nHowever, some might argue that being more generous could help Chris's family. But it's also about personal boundaries. The mother is doing what she can, and it's okay to set limits, especially when it's not planned. So, I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
