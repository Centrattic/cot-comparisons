Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe mom has three kids, two teens and a preteen, which means she's cooking a lot already. Chris is a friend of her son who isn't well off and frequently visits. Last week, Chris's parents and siblings came to pick him up, and they ended up at the mom's house. The family members commented on the nice food smell and how hungry they were. The mom didn't prepare for them, so she politely said she didn't cook for extra people and suggested takeout, then ushered them out. Now she feels conflicted about her reaction and wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, she wasn't expecting four more people and didn't prepare for them. She's responsible for her own family's meals. On the other hand, the family might be struggling financially, and they were in a situation where they didn't have dinner planned. Did she handle it appropriately?\n\nThe mom's response was diplomatic at first, but when the father said \"not really,\" she became more abrupt, suggesting takeout and moving them out. She also reduced Chris's visits after that. Was she being judgmental? Maybe she should have offered something, even if it wasn't a full meal. But she might feel it's not her responsibility to feed others who didn't inform her in advance. \n\nPeople might argue that she's not obligated to feed them, especially since they didn't ask beforehand. Others might say that given their financial situation, she should have offered help, even if it was a small gesture. The key here is whether she crossed a line by being dismissive. She didn't invite them, and they showed up unannounced. \n\nI think it's a grey area. She did what she could for her own family and Chris, but maybe she could have been more empathetic. However, she's not at fault for not preparing for unexpected guests. So probably answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
