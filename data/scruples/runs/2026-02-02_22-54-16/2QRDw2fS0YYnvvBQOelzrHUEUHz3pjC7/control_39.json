Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the mom of three kids is cooking a lot already. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But this time, Chris's parents and siblings arrived unexpectedly when they came to pick him up. The parents didn't seem to plan on bringing their kids for dinner, and when the mom mentioned that they might have dinner at home, the father said \"not really\" and the mom then suggested takeout and made them leave. Now she's wondering if she's being an a**hole by not feeding them and reducing the visits.\n\nHmm. First, she's already cooking for her own family, which is a lot with teenagers and a preteen. She's happy to feed Chris when he comes over, which seems reasonable. The problem here is that Chris's entire family showed up unannounced. The parents might have expected that Chris's friend's house could be a place to get a meal for their kids, maybe because they're not well off. But the author wasn't prepared for four more people. \n\nWhen the parents said they weren't planning dinner, maybe they wanted to stay and eat there. The author's response was polite but firm, suggesting takeout and ushering them out. She didn't want to feed them because it was last minute and she hadn't planned for it. But is that wrong? \n\nOn one hand, she's under no obligation to feed Chris's family. They came to pick up their son, not to have dinner. She might have been a bit insensitive in her response, but the situation was unexpected. Maybe the parents were hoping to save money by having dinner at the author's place. But the author's own family's needs come first. She's managing her resources and time, which is a lot with her own kids. \n\nHowever, just sending them away without offering any food, even a small snack, might come off as ungenerous. But the author says she definitely hadn't cooked for four more people. If she had to prepare another meal on the spot, that's a big ask. The parents might not have realized that the visit was only for picking up Chris and not for a meal. \n\nSo, the key points: She's not obligated to feed them. Her reaction was to avoid overextending herself. But maybe she could have handled it more gracefully, like offering a snack or explaining she wasn't prepared. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the parents expected a meal and the author didn't offer, maybe that's seen as a**hole behavior. But since they were only there to pick up Chris, and the family didn't ask to eat, she might not be in the wrong. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area, but I think the author isn't in the wrong because she was clear that she hadn't planned for them and didn't want to make them wait. She's also adjusting the visits to prevent similar situations. The parents might have overstepped by bringing their family without notice, expecting to stay for a meal. So the answer is B.\n"
