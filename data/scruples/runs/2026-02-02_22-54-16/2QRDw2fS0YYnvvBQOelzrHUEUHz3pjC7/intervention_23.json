Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the mom in the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that she's feeding her own kids and occasionally her son's friend Chris. But when Chris's family unexpectedly comes over with four people, she's not prepared. She politely tells them that she didn't cook for extra guests and kind of hustles them out. Now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. Chris comes over often, and she's been feeding him. But when his whole family shows up unannounced, that's a different ballgame. She didn't prepare for four extra people. Her response was diplomatic, saying the parents probably have dinner planned, and then suggesting takeout and moving them along. That seems respectful but firm. \n\nFrom her perspective, she's managing her own household. She has a right to set boundaries, especially since she wasn't expecting the whole family. It's not her fault Chris's family is poor, but she's not obligated to feed them on short notice. She's already stretched thin with her own kids. The father's response when asked about dinner plans was dismissive, which might indicate they didn't have an alternative, but she can't be expected to take responsibility for that. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have offered at least a small meal or snack, but given the circumstances\u2014unannounced guests and her not having prepared\u2014it's understandable she didn't. She also adjusted by reducing Chris's visits, which shows she's trying to be considerate without overburdening herself. \n\nThe key points here are her intention to help without being taken advantage of, and her polite but firm boundary setting. She's not in the wrong for protecting her resources and space. So the answer should be B.\n"
