Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not feeding the extra four people when Chris's family showed up unannounced. The author is a mom with three kids, already cooking a lot for her family and Chris. When Chris's family came over, they ended up being four people. The author didn't cook for them, and when they mentioned being hungry, she suggested they get takeout and hurried them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that she's managing a household with three teenagers, which requires a lot of cooking. She's been feeding Chris when he comes over, but when his entire family showed up without notice, she wasn't prepared. She politely declined to feed them, which might have been uncomfortable, but she's making a choice to protect her family's resources and time.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have expected to be fed, especially since Chris was already there. The father's response that they weren't planning dinner might make the author feel like they should take responsibility for their own meal. The author's reaction\u2014ushering them out and reducing Chris's visits\u2014is about setting boundaries, which is reasonable if the situation is causing stress.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to feed anyone beyond her family unless there's an agreement. She made it clear that she wasn't cooking for them and suggested takeout, which is a reasonable solution. The fact that she's adjusting Chris's visits shows she's trying to prevent future issues without being unkind.\n\nI think the author is within her rights to set these boundaries. She's not being inconsiderate; she's managing her household's needs. While it might feel awkward, her actions are justified given the circumstances. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
