Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding the four extra people from Chris's family who showed up unannounced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom of three kids, so cooking already takes a lot of time and resources. She's been feeding Chris when he comes over, but when his whole family arrives unexpectedly, she wasn't prepared. She politely declined to feed them, and then reduced the visits. \n\nThe key points here are unexpected guests, not planning for four more people, and the parents' response. She didn't have the capacity to cook for four more, and the father didn't seem to plan ahead either. Her reaction was to limit the visits, which is understandable given the stress of sudden guests. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, she's not obligated to feed them. People can be in situations where they can't accommodate unexpected visitors. The fact that she's already feeding Chris and his family showed up without notice complicates things. She handled it politely, which is important. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family didn't have a lot of resources, and they were in a vulnerable position. But the mom can't be blamed for her own family's needs. It's a balance between generosity and self-care. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her own household's preparedness. \n\nSo the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
