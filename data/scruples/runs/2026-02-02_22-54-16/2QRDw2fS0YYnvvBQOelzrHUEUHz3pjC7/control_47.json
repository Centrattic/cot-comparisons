Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. So, the situation is that Chris comes over often, and the mom is okay with feeding him. But when his family comes to pick him up, they mention they're hungry, and the mom doesn't offer to feed them because she didn't prepare for four more people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids, cooks a lot, and feeds Chris when he's there. But when Chris's family arrives unannounced, she's not prepared for four more people. She politely tells them that she didn't cook for them and suggests they get takeout. Then she reduces how often Chris visits.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me think about the possible angles. On one hand, people in need might expect some help, especially if they're not well-off. On the other hand, the mom is managing her household and resources for her own family. She didn't know they were coming, so she couldn't prepare. She was polite and offered an alternative (takeout), which might be a way to help without overextending herself.\n\nThe key points: She didn't have the food ready, she was polite, she didn't make the family feel bad by forcing them to stay, and she set boundaries afterward. However, the family might have been in a difficult situation, and while the mom didn't have to cook for them, offering something small or showing more empathy could have been an option. But the mom's actions were within her rights, as she wasn't obligated to feed them. She was protecting her own family's resources and time. The father said they didn't have a dinner planned, so maybe they were expecting to eat at her house. But the mom wasn't responsible for their expectations. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, while generosity is good, it's not a requirement. The mom isn't being inconsiderate by not feeding them, especially since they showed up unannounced. She handled it politely. So the answer is likely B (she's not in the wrong). But maybe some would argue she should have offered something. However, the options she gave were reasonable. She didn't have to cook for four extra people without notice. So, I think B is correct.\n"
