Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nShe's a mom with three kids, which means she's already cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son who comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. Then Chris's parents and siblings show up without her knowing. The family comments on the food and how hungry they are. She responds by saying she didn't cook for them and suggests takeout, then asks them to leave. After that, she reduces how often her son can hang out with Chris.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. She didn't know the family was coming, so she wasn't prepared to feed four extra people. She was polite, said they probably have dinner planned, then suggested takeout. She didn't offer food but also didn't make them stay. She later limits the visits to avoid this again. \n\nOn one hand, she's not obligated to feed people who showed up without notice. She's managing her household and her resources. It's reasonable to not expect her to accommodate unexpected guests, especially since she's already cooking for her own family. She handled it politely and offered a solution (takeout). \n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a tough situation financially. The dad even said \"not really\" when asked about dinner plans. So maybe they were in a bind. But it's also possible that the mom isn't responsible for their situation. She didn't invite them, and it's not her duty to feed them. \n\nThe key points here are expectation and boundaries. She didn't set the expectation that her home is open for others to use as a meal source unless invited. She was polite but firm in her response. The fact that she reduced visits afterward shows she's trying to avoid similar situations, which is reasonable to protect her family's needs.\n\nI think the answer is B (No). She's not in the wrong because she handled the situation with diplomacy and set boundaries. She wasn't rude, and she's responsible for her household's meals. The problem was the unexpected guests, not her response.\n"
