Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, she's a mom of three kids, including teenagers, which definitely means a lot of cooking. She's used to feeding her own family, and Chris, the friend, comes over often, which she handles. But when Chris's family comes to pick him up, they show up at her doorstep. They mention how nice the food smells and that they're hungry. \n\nShe responds by saying she didn't plan for them and tells them to go get takeout. The father says they don't really have plans, but she insists they leave. She then reduces Chris's visits to avoid this situation again.\n\nNow, from an ethics standpoint, am I supposed to feed unexpected guests if I didn't plan for them? On one hand, she's been feeding Chris, but when his entire family shows up, she didn't prepare for four more people. It's her home, and she has the right to set boundaries. She's responsible for her own family's meals, and it's reasonable to not expect to feed others without prior notice. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, hospitality is expected, but the user might be in a different context. She's already stretched thin with her own kids. The father's response of \"not really\" might imply they need food, but that's their responsibility. She's not obligated to provide for others beyond her family. \n\nHowever, could there be a more compassionate way to handle it? Instead of being abrupt, maybe offering a sandwich if she had any. But she didn't plan for them, so maybe she didn't have extra. Her response was firm, which might come off as rude. But she's also protecting her own household's resources. \n\nI think the key points are: unexpected guests, no prior notice, and her responsibility to her family. She's not in the wrong for not accommodating them without planning. She handled it politely, even if it was firm. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
