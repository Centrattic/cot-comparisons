Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom who's feeding her own kids and a friend of her son, but when the friend's family showed up unexpectedly, she didn't feed them and told her son to limit the visits. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom with three kids, which means she's already cooking a lot. The son's friend Chris is welcome when he comes over, but when his family showed up without notice, she wasn't prepared. Her response was polite but set a boundary. \n\nThe key points here are expectations and boundaries. She didn't know they'd come, so it's unfair to expect her to feed them. She was honest that she hadn't cooked for extra people. Her comment about takeout and urging them to leave seems reasonable to avoid a bad situation. \n\nThe father said they weren't expecting dinner, which implies they didn't plan to stay. Maybe the family didn't realize how inconvenient their visit was. The mom then adjusts her son's interactions to prevent future issues. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation to feed guests? In many cultures, hospitality is important, but this was a sudden, unplanned visit. The mom's family's needs come first. She's not obligated to host or feed others without prior arrangement. \n\nSome might argue that she should have offered something anyway, but she had to manage her own household's needs. She did acknowledge their hunger but made it clear she couldn't accommodate. Her actions were about maintaining her own family's routine and not overextending. \n\nThe user's own feeling of being an asshole despite doing the right thing shows internal conflict. But based on the situation, she handled it as best as she could under the circumstances. The answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
