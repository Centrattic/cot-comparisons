Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. She had cooked for her own kids and Chris, but when his entire family arrived, she didn't have food for them. She politely said they probably had dinner planned and then suggested takeout, sending them on their way. Now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from her perspective. She's a mom with three kids, so cooking a lot is part of her routine. Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when his family showed up without notice, she wasn't prepared. She had to make a quick decision to protect her resources. Her response was diplomatic, trying to manage the situation without being rude.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a tough financial situation, as mentioned that Chris isn't too well off. The mother might have felt that her family's needs should take priority. But maybe there's a cultural aspect where hosting guests is expected. However, in many cases, unexpected guests can be a challenge, especially when you're not prepared.\n\nThe key points are: She didn't know they were coming, she politely declined, and she's adjusting her son's interactions to prevent future issues. The father's comment \"not really\" could imply they were in a situation where they couldn't provide dinner, but it's not her responsibility to feed them. She's not obligated to host strangers just because they show up. Her family's comfort and resources should come first.\n\nSo, while it's admirable she's kind to Chris, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her own family. The answer is B.\n"
