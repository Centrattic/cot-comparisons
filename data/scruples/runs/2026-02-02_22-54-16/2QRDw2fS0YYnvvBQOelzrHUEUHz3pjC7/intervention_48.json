Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the mom is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a mom of three kids, and she's feeding them a lot. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding Chris. But then Chris's family suddenly comes to pick him up, and includes four people. They mention how hungry they are, and the mom didn't cook for them. She politely says they probably have dinner planned, but the dad says they don't. She then tells them to get takeout and ushers them out. After that, she reduces the number of Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a single mom with three teenagers, so her time and resources are already stretched thin. She wasn't expecting four extra guests, so it's understandable that she didn't cook for them. She tried to be diplomatic, deflecting by saying they probably have dinner plans. When the dad says they don't, she's firm but polite, suggesting takeout and moving them along.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she's being honest about her situation. She didn't make a big deal about it, just handled the situation practically. It's her home, and she's managing her own resources. She didn't offer food, but she also didn't make them feel unwelcome. The family might be in a tough spot financially, but that doesn't mean the mom has to host them. She's not being mean; she's setting boundaries for her family's well-being. The fact that she even allows Chris to come over is a kindness. The follow-up action of reducing visits is about managing her own capacity, not being hostile.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she could have offered a snack or something, but she's already stretched thin. Also, maybe the family expected more, but the mom wasn't in a position to accommodate. It's a tricky situation, but I think her actions are reasonable. She's protecting her family's resources and time, which is her right as a parent. So I think she's not in the wrong.\n"
