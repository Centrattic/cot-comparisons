Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The mom is dealing with her son's friend Chris and his family. She's a single parent with three kids, so cooking is already a big task. When Chris's family shows up unexpectedly, she didn't plan for four more people. She tried to politely suggest they leave because she wasn't prepared to feed them. The father's response was noncommittal, and she ended up sending them away. Now, she's feeling conflicted about cutting down on Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's managing a household with teenagers, which means high food consumption. The unexpected guests were last-minute, and she wasn't ready. Her response was diplomatic, but she's worried about being seen as rude. The key points here are her responsibility to her family's needs and the lack of prior notice from Chris's family.\n\nOn one hand, she's not obligated to feed people who show up uninvited. She tried to be polite, even suggesting takeout. On the other hand, Chris's family is in a tough financial situation. But the problem is that the visitors were four people, not just Chris. The mother might feel like she's being asked to take on more than she can handle without any notice.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From the scenario, she didn't invite them and wasn't prepared. She handled it as best as she could without causing a confrontation. The fact that she's a parent with her own family's needs first makes her actions understandable. She's not being mean, just protecting her household's resources. So, the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
