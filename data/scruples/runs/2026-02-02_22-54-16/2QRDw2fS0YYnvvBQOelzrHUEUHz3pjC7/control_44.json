Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom in the situation is in the wrong. So the mom has two teenagers and a preteen, which already means she's cooking a lot. She's feeding her son's friend Chris sometimes because Chris isn't well off. Then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with two siblings, and she didn't prepare for them. She tried to politely say they should leave because she didn't cook for four more people. The father replied they didn't have dinner plans, so she told them to take out food and leave quickly.\n\nThe mom then cut down the number of visits from four to one per week. She's conflicted because she feels she did the right thing for her family but feels like an asshole. The user wants to know if she's in the wrong, answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The mom is doing her best to manage her household and her family's needs. She's already stretched thin with three kids. When Chris's family shows up unannounced, she hasn't prepared for four extra people. She politely but firmly asked them to leave, which she has the right to do. She's not responsible for feeding them, especially when they came without prior notice. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. If she's aware that Chris isn't well off, bringing up their poverty might be a factor. But she's not obligated to feed them. The parents should have arranged for meals if they knew they were coming. The mom is protecting her family's resources. On the other hand, maybe she could have offered a more compassionate response, like offering to take them to a restaurant or giving them a small amount of food, but she's justified in wanting to protect her own family's needs. \n\nThe key points are that she didn't plan for the guests, she politely but clearly set boundaries, and she's managing her household's resources. She didn't act out of malice but to protect her family. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because she's within her rights to control her home and manage her resources as she sees fit. The unexpected guests were Chris's parents' responsibility to handle, not hers. She's allowed to limit visits if it's causing strain. So the answer is B.\n"
