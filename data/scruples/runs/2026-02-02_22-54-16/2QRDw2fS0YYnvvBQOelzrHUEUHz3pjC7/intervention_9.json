Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mother did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. She had planned for Chris but not his family. The key points here are her situation, the context of her family's needs, and her response.\n\nFirst, she's a mom with three kids, so cooking a lot already. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's been feeding him. But when Chris's family came unannounced, she wasn't prepared. She politely said they probably have dinner plans, then suggested takeout. The father said they didn't have anything, so she urged them to leave. Now she's feeling conflicted about cutting back on Chris's visits.\n\nI need to consider if she was rude. She didn't invite them, but she did make an effort to be polite. Her main duty is to her own family. She's not obligated to feed others unexpectedly. The father's response about not having plans might have been a bit of a nudge, but she handled it by suggesting takeout and moving them along. It's a delicate balance between being helpful and respecting her own space and resources. \n\nThe community might see her as in the right because she set boundaries. She's not responsible for others' circumstances, even if they're in need. People can come to her house expecting food, but that's not how social visits usually work. She's managing her household, so reducing Chris's visits to avoid similar situations is a reasonable step. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she could have offered something small, but she was clear that she hadn't prepared for four more people. Takeout as an option was a gesture. The main issue is the unexpected guests. So, she's in the right not to be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
