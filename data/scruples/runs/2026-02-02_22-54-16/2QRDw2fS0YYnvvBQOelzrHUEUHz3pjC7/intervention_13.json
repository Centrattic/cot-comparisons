Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a mom with three kids, including teenagers and a preteen. She's cooking a lot because they eat a lot. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's happy to feed him. But then Chris's family\u2014parents and two siblings\u2014show up unexpectedly. They comment on the nice food smell and how hungry they are. The author didn't cook for four extra people, so she politely suggests that maybe they should get takeout and ushers them out the door. After that, she tells her son to limit Chris's visits or maybe meet elsewhere, like at Chris's house, to avoid another situation.\n\nThe author feels conflicted: she did what's right for her family but feels like an asshole. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. She's managing her household and resources. She's not obligated to feed people who appear without notice. She's diplomatic, telling them that maybe their parents have a dinner plan. When the father says \"not really,\" she suggests takeout and moves them along. That seems reasonable because she wasn't prepared for four more people. Her home is her space, and she's within her rights to set boundaries.\n\nThen there's the aspect of Chris's family's situation. The family isn't well-off, which is mentioned. But the author isn't responsible for feeding them. The unexpected visit was on Chris's family to organize. It's understandable that the author would feel overwhelmed if four more people showed up without prior notice. She's already cooking for her own kids and one extra friend. Adding four more without warning would be a lot.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have offered help in some way, even if she didn't cook for them. But the author was polite and suggested takeout. She didn't turn them away rudely. She was trying to be helpful but also realistic about her capacity. \n\nAnother point is the author reducing Chris's visits. She's concerned about future unexpected visits, so she's adjusting the frequency. That's a personal choice to protect her family's space. It's not uncommon for people to set boundaries when they feel their comfort is being disrupted.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently. For example, maybe offering a simple meal if possible, but she had already stated that she wasn't prepared. The father's response about not having dinner planned might imply that they are in a tough spot, but again, the author isn't responsible for their situation. She's managing her own household's needs.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She handled the situation politely, set boundaries, and is now making adjustments to prevent future issues. It's about respecting her own space and resources. The answer should be B.\n"
