Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a mom, who is feeding her own kids and occasionally feeding Chris, a friend of her son. Then, Chris's family shows up unexpectedly, and the author declines to feed them, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is hosting Chris often, which adds to her cooking load. When Chris's family comes over, they're four people, and the author hadn't planned for them. She politely tells them she hasn't made food for them and suggests they get takeout. The family responds neutrally, and the author reduces the frequency of Chris visiting. The author feels conflicted but thinks she did the right thing.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author obligated to feed Chris's family? She's already cooking for her own kids and one extra. The family showed up without prior notice, which might be a factor. The parents said they weren't planning dinner, but the author wasn't responsible for that. She offered a polite response and suggested they get takeout. \n\nThe author's actions seem reasonable. She's under no obligation to feed others beyond what she's already doing. The unexpected guests could have caused a strain. The author is setting boundaries, which is important, especially with her own family's needs. The parents didn't express any hardship beyond not having dinner planned, so the author's response was appropriate. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the family was in need, but the author isn't responsible for that. The key is that the author didn't invite them and had no prior knowledge. She handled it politely, so it's not her fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
