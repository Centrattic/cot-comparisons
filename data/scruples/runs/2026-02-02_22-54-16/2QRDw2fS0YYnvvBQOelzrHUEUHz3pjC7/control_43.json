Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids, which means she's already cooking a lot. She's feeding one more person, Chris, regularly. Now, Chris's family (parents and two siblings) showed up without notice. She didn't prepare for them, so when they mentioned being hungry, she tried to politely decline by suggesting their parents would have dinner planned. When the dad said they didn't, she suggested takeout and sent them away.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's managing her household and resources. She didn't expect four more people, so it's understandable she felt overwhelmed. She's not obligated to feed them, especially if it's a last-minute thing. However, the situation might also involve empathy towards a family in need. Chris's family might be struggling financially, so maybe they needed the food. The mom's response could be seen as dismissive, but she did try to handle it diplomatically. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there was a way to offer help without overextending herself, like offering a snack or a simple meal. But given that she had no prior notice, it's a tough spot. The key points are intention and context. She didn't want to, but she tried to be polite. The father's response (\"not really\") might have been a red flag, but she still had to make a quick decision. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). She's managing her household and can't be expected to accommodate unexpected guests, especially when it's a strain on resources. However, there's a nuance where maybe she could have offered something small. But given the scenario, she did what she could without overstepping.\n"
