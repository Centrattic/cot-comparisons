Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a mom) is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. \n\nFirst, the context: She's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she's okay feeding him. But when Chris's family comes to pick him up, they end up at her door, and the parents don't have dinner plans. She tries to send them off, cutting the visits from four times a week to once.\n\nThe key points here: She didn't cook for four extra people on short notice. She tried to be polite but firm. The father said they don't have dinner plans, so she suggested takeout and sent them on their way. She then reduces the number of visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, she's managing her household's needs. She's not obligated to feed others unless she's hosting. The unexpected guests might not have realized the impact. Her response seems reasonable given the situation. She's balancing her family's needs and the reality of feeding more people without prior notice. The user's feeling of guilt might stem from empathy for Chris's family, but she's not in the wrong for setting boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (No, she's not in the wrong). But could there be a middle ground? Maybe she could have offered leftovers or a snack, but given the circumstances, her actions are understandable. The main issue is the sudden increase in guests without prior notice, which she handled politely. The reduction in visits is a proactive step to prevent future issues. Therefore, B is the right choice.\n"
