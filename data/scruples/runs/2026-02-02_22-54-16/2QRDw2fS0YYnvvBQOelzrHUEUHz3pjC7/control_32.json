Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding the additional four people from Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. \n\nFirst, the context: She's a mom with three kids, including teenagers who eat a lot. She's already cooking for her family and feeding Chris when he comes over. Then Chris's family arrives unannounced, and she didn't prepare for four more people. She tried to politely suggest they leave to get takeout. Now she's second-guessing her decision.\n\nSo, the key points here. She's responsible for her own family's meals, and feeding an extra person (Chris) when he's over. But when Chris's entire family shows up without notice, she wasn't prepared. She responded by telling them to get takeout and leave, which made her feel guilty. \n\nFrom a standpoint of hospitality, maybe she could have offered to feed them, but she wasn't expecting them. She's managing her own household and resources. She's not obligated to feed people who show up uninvited and without notice. She was polite, gave a diplomatic response, and tried to be understanding of their situation. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have offered something small instead of closing the door. But considering the number of people and the suddenness, it's reasonable she wasn't prepared. She's also trying to protect her resources and not be taken advantage of. Her decision to limit Chris's visits is self-preservation, not mean-spirited.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether she had an obligation. Since the family showed up uninvited, she's not in the wrong for not accommodating them. She handled it politely. The fact that she's concerned about her resources and doesn't want to be taken advantage of is valid. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
