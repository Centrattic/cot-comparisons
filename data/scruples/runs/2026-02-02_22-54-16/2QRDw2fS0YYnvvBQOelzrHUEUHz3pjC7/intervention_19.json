Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about a mom who had unexpected guests\u2014Chris's family\u2014showing up, and she didn't cook for them. She sent them away after a brief interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The mom has three kids, which already means she's busy cooking a lot. She's feeding her own family and when Chris comes over, she's happy to include him. Then, when Chris's family unexpectedly arrives, she wasn't prepared for four more people. She tried to politely suggest they leave because she didn't plan for them. \n\nThe key points here are her responsibility and the guests' actions. She wasn't obligated to feed them, especially since they showed up without prior notice. Her response was diplomatic, offering to take out (which implies they should leave to get food elsewhere). She also didn't force them to stay or make them feel unwelcome. \n\nHer decision to limit future visits is understandable to avoid similar situations. People often don't plan for unannounced guests, so her reaction is reasonable. However, some might argue that she should have offered food regardless, but considering her family's needs and the last-minute nature of the visit, it's not unreasonable to prioritize her own household. \n\nThe father's response (\"not really\") and the mom's follow-up suggest that the family might not have had plans, but that's their situation. The mom isn't responsible for their circumstances. She handled the situation politely and then made a boundary to prevent future issues. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She did what she could under the circumstances, and her actions were respectful while setting clear boundaries for her family's needs.\n"
