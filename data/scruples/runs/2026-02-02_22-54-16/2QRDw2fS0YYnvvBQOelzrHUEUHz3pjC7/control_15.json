Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the mom is in the wrong here. So, she's got three kids, including teenagers who eat a lot. She's cooking a lot already. Then Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and his family isn't well-off. Last week, Chris's whole family showed up unexpectedly to pick him up. They mentioned being hungry, but she wasn't prepared to feed four more people. She tried to politely say they should go get takeout, and then she cut back on Chris's visits.\n\nHmm. First, she's a mom managing a household with three kids. That's a lot of work. She's already cooking for her kids, so adding four more people without notice would be a big ask. She didn't cook for them, so she's not obligated to, right? She tried to be polite by saying maybe their parents have dinner planned, but the dad said \"not really.\" Then she suggested takeout and sent them on their way. That seems reasonable because she wasn't prepared.\n\nBut then she reduced Chris's visits to once a week. Maybe she's worried about another situation like that. Is she being unfair to Chris? Chris isn't poor, but his family is. The mom isn't refusing to feed them out of malice; she just wasn't ready. People can't be expected to feed unexpected guests, especially when they're not responsible for them. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have offered something small, like a snack or a glass of water, but not a full meal. But she didn't, and she's a busy mom. The people were there to pick up Chris, so maybe they just needed a quick stop. She handled it politely, I think. She's not wrong for setting boundaries with her son's friend's family, especially if it's causing stress. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B, No. She's not in the wrong. She's managing her household and can't be expected to feed unexpected guests. She tried to be courteous and then adjusted the frequency of the visits to prevent future issues.\n"
