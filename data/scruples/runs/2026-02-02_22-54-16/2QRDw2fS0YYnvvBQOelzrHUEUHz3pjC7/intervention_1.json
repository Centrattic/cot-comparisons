Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding the extra four people from Chris's family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mom has three kids, including teenagers and a preteen. She's already cooking a lot, which is a big task. Chris, the son's friend, comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's whole family shows up unannounced, including two siblings and parents, she didn't cook for them. She politely said that maybe they should get takeout and even urged them to leave because the kids were hungry. \n\nNow, the family said they weren't planning to have dinner, so maybe they expected her to feed them. But the mom didn't cook for them, and she's now reducing the number of visits from four to one per week. The user wants to know if she's in the wrong. \n\nHmm. On one hand, the mom is doing her best for her own family. It's her home, and she's not obligated to feed people she didn't plan for. She was polite and offered takeout as an alternative. She's not being rude, just standing by her own plans. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family came expecting a meal because they're not well off. But the mom didn't know they were coming. Chris's family arrived without prior notice, so she couldn't have prepared. She even tried to give a polite response. \n\nI think the key points are that the mom is not responsible for feeding guests who came without notice, especially when she's already managing her own family's meals. She handled it politely and tried to be helpful by suggesting takeout. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
