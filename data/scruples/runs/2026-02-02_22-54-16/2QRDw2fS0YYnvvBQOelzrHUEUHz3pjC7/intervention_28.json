Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a mom who's feeding her own kids and a friend of her son, Chris. Then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with two siblings, and she didn't prepare food for them. She politely said they should have their own dinner, and when the dad says they don't really have one, she tells them to get takeout. Now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The mom is already cooking a lot for her own family. She didn't know about the additional four people coming over. She tried to be polite but firm. The parents of Chris didn't plan ahead, leading to an unexpected situation. The mom then decides to limit Chris's visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nI think the main issue here is whether she was obligated to feed the additional four people. Since they came unannounced and without prior notice, she wasn't in a position to prepare. Her response seems reasonable\u2014she didn't want to inconvenience her own family or herself. Also, she's setting boundaries for the future, which is understandable considering the stress of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have been more accommodating given that the family is in a difficult financial situation. But she's under no obligation to host or feed others. It's important to consider both her right to set boundaries and their need for food. However, since the scenario is about her own home and her own children's needs, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
