Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding the additional four people from Chris's family.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. Chris is a friend of her son, and his family comes over unannounced. They mention they're hungry, but she hadn't planned for them. She tells them she wasn't cooking for them and suggests takeout, then cuts off the visits.\n\nI need to consider if her actions were wrong. Well, she's not obligated to feed strangers or even friends who come unannounced. She's managing her household and resources. She was polite, tried to be diplomatic, and even offered takeout. Then she set boundaries by reducing visits to prevent future issues.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a cultural expectation that when guests are present, you should feed them. But she didn't know they were coming, and her response seems reasonable given the lack of prior notice. She didn't refuse outright, just redirected them to takeout. Also, she's considering her own family's needs\u2014she's cooking for her own kids, so adding four more without notice would be a burden.\n\nSo, I think she's in the right. She handled it politely and set boundaries. So answer B.\n"
