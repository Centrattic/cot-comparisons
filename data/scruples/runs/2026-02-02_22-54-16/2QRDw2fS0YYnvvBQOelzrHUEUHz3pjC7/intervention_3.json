Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong here. She's a mom of three kids, and she's feeding her son's friend Chris when he comes over. But when Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with two siblings, the mom didn't prepare for them. She tried to politely say that maybe they should get takeout, and then cut off the visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom is already cooking for her own three teenagers, which is a lot. She didn't know Chris's family would come with four people. It's a last-minute situation. She politely suggested takeout and urged them to leave. That seems respectful. She's also adjusting the number of visits to avoid similar situations. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family was in a tough spot, but the mom isn't obligated to feed them. It's their own responsibility to have dinner plans. The mom didn't invite them, so she's not at fault for not expecting four extra people. The father even said they weren't having dinner, which might have been a request, but the mom isn't required to accommodate that. \n\nAlso, she's protecting her own family's needs. Reducing the visits to once a week seems reasonable after the incident. The key here is that she handled it politely and is taking steps to prevent future issues. So she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
