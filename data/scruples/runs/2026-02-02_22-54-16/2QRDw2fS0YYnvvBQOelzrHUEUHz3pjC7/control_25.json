Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom with three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. Then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with four people. She didn't prepare for them, and they comment on the food smell. She politely suggests they have dinner at home, but the father says they don't have plans. She tells them to get takeout and ushers them out. Now she's feeling guilty but also thinks she did the right thing by her family.\n\nFirst, the situation is about unexpected guests. The mom wasn't expecting four more people, so she didn't cook for them. She tried to be polite by offering takeout and moving them along. She's also reducing the frequency of Chris's visits to avoid this happening again. \n\nIs she wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, she's being honest about her situation. She's not obligated to feed people she wasn't expecting. She tried to be kind by suggesting takeout. On the other hand, maybe the family was in a tough spot, but the mom didn't have the resources. She's also protecting her family's time and resources. \n\nI think she's not in the wrong. She handled it politely and is setting boundaries. The father's response was dismissive, but she can't be responsible for others' circumstances. Her decision to limit visits is about managing her household. So answer B.\n"
