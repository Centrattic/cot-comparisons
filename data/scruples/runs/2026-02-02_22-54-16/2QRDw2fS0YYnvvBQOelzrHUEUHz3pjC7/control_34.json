Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom in this situation is in the wrong. She's a mom of three kids, cooking a lot because they eat a lot. Then her son's friend Chris comes over often, which she's okay with. But when Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with two siblings, the mom didn't cook for them. She tried to politely suggest they leave, and now she's feeling conflicted about cutting back on Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She's already cooking for her own family, which is a big job. Unexpected guests might not be feasible. She's not obligated to feed them, especially if she didn't plan for them. She handled it politely, I think. She said they probably have dinner planned and then suggested takeout. That's a reasonable response. She's also communicating with her son to adjust the frequency of visits to avoid similar situations. \n\nBut then, the other side: Chris's family is in a difficult financial situation. When they came expecting to pick up Chris and maybe just wanted a meal, the mom's response might come off as cold. The father even said they don't have dinner planned, which adds to the tension. However, the mom didn't have to cook for them. She's within her rights to set boundaries. She's not responsible for their situation, even though Chris isn't at fault. \n\nThe key here is whether she was in the wrong for not feeding them. She didn't have to, and she handled it as politely as possible. She's also taking steps to prevent future issues. So I think she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
