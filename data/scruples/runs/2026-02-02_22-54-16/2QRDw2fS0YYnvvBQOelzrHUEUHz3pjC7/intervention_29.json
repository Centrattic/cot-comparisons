Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not feeding the extra people when Chris's family showed up. So the author is a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. Then Chris comes over, and his family shows up unexpectedly with four people, including the parents and two siblings. The author didn't prepare for them, and when they mentioned being hungry, she tried to send them on their way. Now she's feeling conflicted because she's worried about being an asshole but also not wanting to host more people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is already managing a household with teenagers who eat a lot. She didn't know Chris's family would come over. They showed up without prior notice, so she wasn't prepared. She tried to politely decline by suggesting they get takeout. The father didn't seem to mind, and she sent them on their way. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is she obligated to feed them? Well, they came unannounced. It's not like she invited them. She was hosting her own home, and it's reasonable to set boundaries. People generally have the right to control their own homes and who they invite. The family might have thought they were going to eat at the author's house, but the author wasn't in a position to accommodate them. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's some sympathy for the family's situation. They might be poor and not have much food, so they expected kindness. But the author isn't responsible for their circumstances. She can't be expected to feed everyone who comes through her door. She even tried to be polite and suggested takeout. \n\nThe author also adjusted her son's social plans to prevent this from happening again, which shows she's trying to be considerate without overextending herself. So overall, the author isn't in the wrong. It's about setting boundaries and managing her own household without being unreasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
