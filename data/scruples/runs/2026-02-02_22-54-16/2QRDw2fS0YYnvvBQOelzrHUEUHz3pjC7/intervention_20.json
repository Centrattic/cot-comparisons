Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding the additional four people from Chris's family. So, first, let's understand the situation.\n\nThe mom has three kids, all eating a lot. She's already cooking a lot. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she's okay feeding him. But when Chris's parents and siblings show up unannounced, expecting to stay or eat, she's not prepared. She politely declines, and then decides to limit Chris's visits.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, she's a single mom with three teenagers, which can be overwhelming. She didn't invite four extra people for dinner, so she wasn't obligated to feed them. She tried to be polite, suggesting they get takeout and move along. On the other hand, the family might have been in a tough spot financially, and she might have been a bit abrupt in her response.\n\nBut wait, the key here is that the guests showed up uninvited. The mom had no prior notice, so she couldn't prepare. Her family comes first, especially when they're dependent on her. She's not responsible for feeding others who drop by without being asked. Also, she's setting boundaries to prevent future stress, which is reasonable. She's not being mean; she's trying to protect her own family's needs. The father even said they weren't planning a nice dinner, implying they might expect her to provide. But she's not their host, only Chris's friend.\n\nSo, considering all that, the mom isn't in the wrong. She's managing her household and ensuring her family is taken care of. The answer should be B.\n"
