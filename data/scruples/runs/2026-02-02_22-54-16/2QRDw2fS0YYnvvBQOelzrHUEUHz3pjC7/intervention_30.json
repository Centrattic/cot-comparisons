Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a mom who's cooking for her three kids, and Chris, a friend of her son, comes over often. Then Chris's family shows up unannounced with two siblings, and when they mention being hungry, the author didn't cook for them and sent them away. She reduced the number of visits now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is already cooking a lot for her own family. Chris's family just showed up unexpectedly with four people. The author didn't plan to cook for them, so she handled it politely by suggesting they get takeout. She's making a decision to limit visits to avoid future situations. \n\nIs it wrong not to feed unexpected guests? Well, the author didn't have the extra food prepared. It's understandable she didn't want to stretch her resources. The parents didn't seem to plan ahead either; they just showed up. The author's reaction was diplomatic, and she even offered an alternative (takeout). She's also adjusting future interactions to prevent similar issues. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation to help when people are in need. But the author isn't in a position to accommodate without prior notice. It's their home, and they have the right to set boundaries. The parents might have known the situation but still arrived with more people. The author isn't refusing to help because of poverty but because of the last-minute situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's managing her household's needs and setting boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
