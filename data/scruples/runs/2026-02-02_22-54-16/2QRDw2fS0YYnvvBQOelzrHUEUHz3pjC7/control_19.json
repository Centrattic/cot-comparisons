Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family. She has three kids, so cooking a lot already. Chris comes over often, and his family showed up unexpectedly with two siblings and parents. They were hungry, but she hadn't planned to feed them. She tried to politely send them on their way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom with teenagers who eat a lot. She's already cooking for her own kids, plus Chris. Sudden four more people would be a big ask. She didn't prepare for them, so she couldn't just feed them. She tried to be polite, suggesting they get takeout. Then she told her son to maybe meet Chris elsewhere less often.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she wasn't expecting four extra people. It's not her responsibility to feed them if they didn't plan ahead. She handled it politely, even offered takeout. The father's response was noncommittal, so maybe they didn't have food plans. She's not obligated to feed them. Her reaction is understandable given her situation. So, likely answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
