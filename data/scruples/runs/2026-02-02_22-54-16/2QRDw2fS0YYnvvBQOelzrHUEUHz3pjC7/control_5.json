Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mom did something wrong by not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. She's a mom with teenagers who eat a lot, and she was already cooking for her own kids. Chris's family came to pick him up, and during that visit, the family members mentioned they were hungry. The mom tried to politely suggest they have takeout and left quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a single mom with three kids, so her resources and time are limited. Preparing meals for a large family is a significant task, and she wasn't expecting four extra people. The father did say they weren't really planning a nice dinner, which might add to the pressure. But she's not obligated to feed them, especially if they didn't ask. Her response was diplomatic but firm, which makes sense. She even suggested takeout, which is a kind gesture. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The mom feels conflicted because she wants to help but also needs to prioritize her own family. It's important to recognize that while she's being helpful to Chris, she can't be responsible for everyone else's needs. The fact that she reduced the number of visits shows she's trying to manage the situation without fully cutting off Chris. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Probably not. She didn't have the expectation or ability to host four more people. The family didn't ask for food, just mentioned they were hungry. Her response was polite and practical. People in need might feel uncomfortable asking for help, but the mom isn't required to offer it unless there's an established agreement. So, the answer is B.\n"
