Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. \n\nFirst, the author is a mom with three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. When Chris comes over, she's happy to feed him. But when Chris's whole family arrives unannounced, she's not prepared for four more people. She tries to politely suggest they leave since she didn't cook for them. Then she decides to limit Chris's visits because of this.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author didn't have a prior agreement to feed Chris's family. They just showed up without notice. It's reasonable for someone to have boundaries about unexpected guests, especially when it's a family of three teenagers and a preteen who already eat a lot. The author's responsibility is primarily to her own family, and she's not obligated to feed others unless it's agreed upon. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural expectation here. If Chris's family is in a vulnerable situation because they're poor, some might argue that the author should have offered help. But the author didn't prepare for them, and it's a last-minute situation. She also didn't have any prior indication that Chris's family would need food. \n\nThe author's response was to politely decline and then reduce the frequency of Chris's visits. That seems like a reasonable way to handle the situation without causing immediate harm. She's not refusing help out of spite, but rather setting boundaries for her family's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had known in advance, maybe she could have adjusted, but since it was unexpected, she's not at fault. The family might have had good intentions, but they should have coordinated better. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's managing her household and setting appropriate boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
