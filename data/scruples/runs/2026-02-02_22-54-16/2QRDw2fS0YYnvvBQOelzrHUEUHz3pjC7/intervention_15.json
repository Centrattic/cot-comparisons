Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, she's a mom with three kids, so cooking a lot is already part of her routine. Chris is a friend of her son who comes over often, and she's okay feeding him. But then Chris's entire family shows up unexpectedly, including two siblings and parents. They comment on the food smell and get hungry. The mom didn't plan for them, so she politely tells them to head out because she can't feed them. She even suggests takeout. After that, she tells her son to limit Chris's visits or maybe go to his house instead to avoid repeats.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she didn't expect four more people and hadn't prepared for them. She's managing her own family's meals already. Her response was diplomatic, suggesting takeout and urging them to leave. She's not being rude, just honest about her situation. She's also adjusting future interactions to prevent similar situations, which is reasonable for her household's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe some people might think that since Chris is a regular, the mom should accommodate his family. But the key here is that the family showed up without notice. She wasn't expecting them, so expecting her to feed them on short notice isn't fair. Also, the father said they \"not really\" have dinner planned, which implies they might rely on others, which isn't the mom's responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, the mom isn't in the wrong. She handled the situation politely and set boundaries to protect her family's needs. The answer should be B.\n"
