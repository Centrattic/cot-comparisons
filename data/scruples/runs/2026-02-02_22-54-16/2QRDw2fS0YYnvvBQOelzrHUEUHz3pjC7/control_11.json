Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the mom is cooking a lot for her three kids, and her son's friend Chris comes over often. Chris's family isn't well-off, and they came to pick him up. When they arrived, the family was on the doorstep, one sibling used the bathroom, and they commented on the nice food smell and how hungry they were. The mom didn't plan to feed them, so she told them she wasn't cooking for them and suggested takeout, then kind of ushered them out. Now she's feeling conflicted about cutting back on Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mom's perspective. She's already managing a household with three teenagers, which is a lot. Preteens and teenagers eat a lot, so meal planning is probably tight. Unexpected guests, especially four more people, would be a big deal. She wasn't prepared to feed them, and the parents didn't have a dinner plan either. She tried to handle it diplomatically by suggesting takeout and moving things along. But the way she did it\u2014ushering them to the door\u2014might come off as abrupt. \n\nOn the other hand, the family was on the doorstep without prior notice. It's reasonable that the mom didn't plan for them. But maybe there's an expectation of hospitality here. However, the mom isn't obligated to feed them. She's already providing for her own kids and Chris. The father's comment about not having a dinner plan might make the mom feel responsible, but she's not their caregiver. \n\nI think the key points are whether the mom acted unkindly. She did try to be polite, even if she was firm. She suggested takeout, which is a solution, and then moved to close the interaction. The problem might be that she felt pressured. Also, the mom is now limiting Chris's visits, which is understandable to avoid the same situation. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Probably not. She had no obligation to feed the family. They showed up unannounced, and she's managing her own household. The way she handled it could be seen as firm but fair. Maybe she could have offered a snack or a drink, but that's not required. The main issue is that the family expected something that wasn't part of the arrangement. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
