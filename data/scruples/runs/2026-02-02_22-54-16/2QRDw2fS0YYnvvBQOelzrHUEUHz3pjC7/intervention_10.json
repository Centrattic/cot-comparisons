Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom of three kids, and she's cooking a lot. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's family arrives unexpectedly with four people, they comment on the food. The mom didn't plan to cook for them, so she tries to politely send them away. After that, she decides to limit Chris's visits.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, she's doing what she can for her family and wasn't expecting extra guests. She's being polite but firm. On the other, maybe she could have offered something simple even if she didn't cook a full meal. But she didn't have time or resources for four more people. Also, she's a parent, so prioritizing her own family's needs is understandable. The father's reply was nonchalant, which might have added to the tension. The mom's response was to reduce the visits, which is reasonable to avoid future issues. I think she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
