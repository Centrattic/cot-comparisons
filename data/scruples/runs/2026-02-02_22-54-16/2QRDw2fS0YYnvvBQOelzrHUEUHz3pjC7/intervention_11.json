Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by not feeding the additional four people when Chris's family showed up. The author is a mom juggling feeding her own kids and had no idea that Chris's family would come over with two more siblings. She tried to be polite but also set boundaries when the family mentioned they weren't planning dinner. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author had no prior notice of the extra guests. She was cooking for her own family and a friend, Chris. When the family arrived unexpectedly, the kids mentioned they were hungry. The author's response was to suggest they get takeout and leave, which was firm but polite. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's managing a lot already. She's a parent to three kids, which is a lot of work. Suddenly having four more people show up without being prepared could be overwhelming. She didn't have the resources or time to feed them, and it's reasonable to set boundaries. Also, she didn't want future visits that might bring more people unannounced.\n\nOn the other hand, the family was in a situation where they didn't have dinner planned. They might be struggling financially, so being turned away could be a big deal for them. The father's response of \"not really\" when told about takeout might imply they can't afford it. The author's reaction could be seen as insensitive if the family is genuinely unable to get food. But the author didn't know their situation beforehand. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author tried to be polite but also had to make a decision based on her current circumstances. She even offered an alternative (takeout) which might have been a kind gesture if they could afford it. However, the author's main responsibility is to her own family, and she's within her rights to set boundaries. \n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether it's reasonable to expect her to accommodate unexpected guests, especially when she wasn't prepared. Since she had no prior warning and the family didn't mention their situation until they were there, her response seems justified. She's not obligated to feed others beyond what she can manage. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
