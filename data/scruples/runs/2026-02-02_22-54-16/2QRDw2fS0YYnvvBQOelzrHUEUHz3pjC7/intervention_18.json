Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding four unexpected guests from her son's friend's family. \n\nFirst, the situation: She has three kids, and she's cooking a lot already. Her son's friend Chris comes over often. One day, Chris's family shows up\u2014parents and two siblings. They come to pick up Chris, but while there, they mention being hungry. The mom didn't prepare for four extra people. She tries to politely suggest they go get takeout, then ushers them out. She's now considering limiting Chris's visits.\n\nThe question is whether she's wrong. \n\nI need to consider the context. She's a mom with teenagers, which can be demanding. She's not obligated to feed guests unless they were invited. The family showed up unannounced, and she wasn't prepared. Her response was polite, using phrases like \"nice dinner planned\" and suggesting takeout. She even tried to move things along because the kids were hungry. \n\nFrom her perspective, she's managing her family's meals and resources. She's not being cruel\u2014she's just not responsible for feeding people who came unexpectedly. The family's poverty isn't her fault, but she can't be expected to accommodate them without prior notice. \n\nOn the other hand, some might see it as a lack of generosity. But she's not refusing to help; she's just not overextending herself. The key here is that it wasn't a request, and she wasn't aware they were coming. Her actions seem reasonable. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She handled it politely and set boundaries, which is fair given her circumstances.\n"
