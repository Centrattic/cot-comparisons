Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mom who's trying to feed her own three kids, and when Chris's family shows up unannounced, she declines to feed them, leading her to feel guilty but also not wanting to host them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids who eat a lot, so she's already cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's been feeding him when he comes over. But when Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with four people, she wasn't prepared. She tried to be polite but set a boundary. The dad's response was non-committal, and the mom then told her son to maybe meet elsewhere.\n\nThe key points here are whether she's obligated to feed them. Since it was unexpected, she didn't prepare for four more people. She was polite but firm. The family's situation (being poor) isn't her fault, but she's not responsible for their needs. Her own family's needs come first, and managing her time and resources is a valid concern.\n\nSome might argue that she should have offered something despite not being prepared, but others would say she's within her rights to prioritize her own household. The fact that she was diplomatic and even suggested takeout might show consideration. However, she's also setting boundaries to prevent future stress, which is reasonable.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often looks at intentions and context. The mom's intentions were good; she's trying to manage her household and didn't want to be in a difficult spot again. The family's actions (showing up unannounced with four people) might be seen as inconsiderate, but the mom's response was measured. So, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
