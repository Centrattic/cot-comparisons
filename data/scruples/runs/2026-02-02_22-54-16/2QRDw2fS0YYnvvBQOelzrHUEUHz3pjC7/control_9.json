Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom of three kids and she's cooking a lot because they eat a lot. She has a son's friend, Chris, who comes over often. She's okay feeding Chris, but when Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with four people, she's not prepared. She politely suggests they get takeout and sends them away. Now she's questioning if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her situation. She's a parent managing a household with teenagers, which is already demanding. She didn't cook for four extra people, so she was trying to protect her family's resources. She handled it diplomatically by offering takeout instead of making them stay. \n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a difficult financial situation, and not having dinner might be a real problem. The dad said \"not really\" when asked if they had dinner planned, which implies they didn't. But the mom didn't know that beforehand. She had to make a quick decision when faced with unexpected guests.\n\nIs she obligated to feed people who show up unannounced? Probably not. She was clear about not having cooked for them and offered an alternative. Her main duty is to her own family. However, there's a social aspect here\u2014maybe she could have invited them to a restaurant with her, but that's not her responsibility unless she's prepared for it. \n\nHer reducing Chris's visits is a reasonable step to prevent future issues. She's not being cruel, just setting boundaries. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The key points are her handling it politely, not preparing for the guests, and prioritizing her family's needs. She didn't refuse help entirely but suggested takeout. That's thoughtful. So yes, B is correct.\n"
