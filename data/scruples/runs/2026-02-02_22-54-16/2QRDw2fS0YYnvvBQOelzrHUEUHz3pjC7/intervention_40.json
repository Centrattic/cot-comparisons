Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. She has a son with a friend, Chris, who comes over often. When Chris's family comes to pick him up, they comment on the nice food and hunger, and she tells them she didn't cook for them. Then she tells her son to reduce visits. She's conflicted but feels she did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her actions were wrong. The key points here are her responsibility to her own family and the unexpected guests. She's a mom cooking for her three kids. Chris's family shows up unannounced, and she wasn't prepared. She politely deflects, suggesting takeout and ushering them out. Then she limits Chris's visits to avoid future issues.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, she's not obligated to feed others unless it's expected. The family didn't have an invitation to stay for dinner. Her response was diplomatic but firm. The father's nonchalant reply about not having dinner might imply they knew she'd offer, but that's speculative. She's protecting her own family's needs. Limiting Chris's visits is her choice, especially if the frequency is causing stress. The kids might not realize the financial pressure.\n\nHowever, some might argue that offering food is a kindness, and cutting off Chris's visits could affect the kids' friendship. But she's managing her household's resources, which is her right. She's not inconsiderate; she's being practical. The father's family's behavior might have been opportunistic. So, the mom isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
