Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's family (parents and two siblings) showed up unannounced, expecting to stay or eat, she wasn't prepared. She tried to politely say they should go get takeout, then reduced the visits.\n\nThe key points here are: she's already cooking for her own family, the visitors were unexpected, and she didn't plan for four more people. Her response was to send them to get takeout and later limit the visits. She feels conflicted because she's worried about being a bad person but also feels she's protecting her family's resources.\n\nI think the author isn't wrong. She wasn't obligated to feed them, especially since it was last minute and she wasn't prepared. She handled it politely, and adjusting the visit frequency makes sense. The family's poverty isn't Chris's fault, but the author isn't responsible for feeding others unless she chose to invite them. The father's nonchalant response (\"not really\") might imply they knew they'd be a burden, but that's speculative.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own family's needs and setting boundaries.\n"
