Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. The author is a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already, and she didn't plan for four more people. When Chris's family arrived, they weren't expecting to have dinner there. The author tried to politely send them on their way because she didn't have food for them. Now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. On one hand, the author is managing a household with teenagers who eat a lot. She's already cooking for her own kids, so adding four more people without prior notice would be a big ask. She tried to be polite, even suggesting takeout and urging them to leave since the kids were hungry. That seems reasonable. She also adjusted by limiting Chris's visits, which shows she's trying to prevent future issues.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family was in a situation where they didn't have dinner plans. The father said \"not really\" when asked if they had dinner planned. Maybe they were in a tight spot and hoped to get something. The author's refusal could be seen as not being hospitable. However, the family did come to pick up Chris, not to get food. The author didn't invite them, and it's not her responsibility to feed them unless she chose to. She was clear about not having food for them and suggested takeout, which is a kind solution.\n\nThe key points here are intention and responsibility. The author didn't invite them, so she's not obligated to feed them. She handled the situation politely and took steps to avoid similar situations in the future. Feeling like an asshole is natural when you have to say no, but she's not in the wrong. Her actions were about managing her resources and being honest about her capacity. The answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
