Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not feeding the additional four people who showed up unannounced. The situation is that the author's son's friend Chris came over with his family, and they ended up turning up without prior notice. The author had not planned to cook for them, and when the family mentioned they were hungry, the author tried to send them to get takeout instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has teenagers who eat a lot, so cooking is already a big task. Chris's family showed up without being invited, and the author wasn't prepared to feed four more people. It's important to note that the family mentioned they weren't really going to have dinner, which might have added pressure on the author to feed them. However, the author had no obligation to do so since they weren't invited guests. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the author act inconsiderately? 2) Was there an expectation that they would feed the visitors? The author tried to handle the situation diplomatically by suggesting takeout and encouraging them to leave. They also adjusted their son's social plans afterward to prevent future issues. \n\nPeople might argue that the author was unkind, but others would see it as reasonable to expect guests to plan their own meals, especially when they arrive without notice. The author isn't in a position to constantly accommodate unexpected large groups, especially with their own family's needs. \n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They made a considerate but firm decision to protect their resources and family's schedule.\n"
