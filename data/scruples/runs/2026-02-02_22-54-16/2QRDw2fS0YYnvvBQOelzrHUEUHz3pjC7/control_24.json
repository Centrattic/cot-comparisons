Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a mom who's been hosting her son's friend Chris, who isn't well-off. She's okay with feeding Chris when he comes over because she knows he's from a poorer family. But when Chris's entire family shows up unexpectedly to pick him up, and they start commenting on the food and getting hungry, she politely declines to feed them, saying they should get takeout and ushers them out. Now she's feeling conflicted about her decision.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether she did something wrong. The key points here are her intention and the context. She had not prepared for four extra people, and she made that clear. She was already cooking for her own family and Chris. When the family showed up unannounced and mentioned they weren't planning to have dinner, she suggested takeout and encouraged them to leave. That seems reasonable because she wasn't responsible for feeding them. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Her actions were practical\u2014she didn't want to overburden herself, and she made a polite but firm boundary. She's also adjusting her son's social plans to avoid future situations. The father's response (\"not really\") might imply that they are in a tough spot, but that doesn't obligate her to provide a meal if they came uninvited. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a social expectation to be hospitable, but she had a valid reason not to host. She didn't ignore their needs; she offered a solution (takeout) and set a limit. The fact that she later reduces Chris's visits shows she's considering their situation but still prioritizing her family's well-being. \n\nSo, she's not in the wrong. She handled it respectfully without overextending herself. The answer should be B.\n"
