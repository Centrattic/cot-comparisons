Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding the additional four people when Chris's family came over. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the mom has three kids, which is a lot, and she's already cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son who's not well-off, and he comes over often. The mom is okay with feeding him. But when Chris's family came to pick him up, there were four people on the doorstep. One sibling needed the bathroom and commented on the nice smell of food. The family then mentioned they were hungry. The mom tried to politely say that maybe their parents have dinner planned, but the dad said \"not really.\" Then the mom suggested takeout and urged them to leave. After that, she told her son to maybe meet Chris elsewhere less often or go to his house instead.\n\nThe question is whether the mom is in the wrong. Let me think. First, she had not planned to feed four extra people, which is understandable. She's already cooking for her own family. She tried to be diplomatic. The family showed up unannounced with more people. The dad's response was a bit dismissive. The mom then told her son to reduce the visits. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, she didn't have an obligation to feed them. She tried to be polite but set boundaries. However, maybe she could have handled the situation more gracefully. But given that they were guests picking up Chris, it's reasonable she didn't expect them to eat. Also, she's managing her household, which is legitimate. On the other hand, if Chris's family was in need, maybe she could have offered something, but she was already stressed. \n\nI think the key here is that she didn't make them stay or refuse help entirely. She suggested takeout and moved them along. Her actions were about maintaining her household's needs. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
