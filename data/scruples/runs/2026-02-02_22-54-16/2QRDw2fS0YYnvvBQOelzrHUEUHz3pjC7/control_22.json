Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom who's been feeding her son's friend Chris, who's not well off. She's okay with feeding Chris, but when his whole family shows up unexpectedly, she's not prepared. She tried to politely send them on their way because she didn't cook for them. Now she's feeling conflicted about cutting back Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She's a mom with three kids, already cooking a lot. Her resources and time are stretched thin. She didn't expect four extra people, and she's responsible for her own family's meals. She handled it politely, didn't offer food, but also didn't make them stay. She's trying to prevent future situations by reducing Chris's visits.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a tough spot. They came expecting to pick up their son and maybe didn't realize they'd be imposing. The father's comment about not having dinner might indicate they're struggling. The mom's response was firm but she didn't make them wait or force them to stay. She's not refusing help entirely but setting boundaries.\n\nIs she in the wrong? She's not obligated to feed them. She's managing her household and her resources. Her actions are about setting limits, which is reasonable. She's not being mean, just practical. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
