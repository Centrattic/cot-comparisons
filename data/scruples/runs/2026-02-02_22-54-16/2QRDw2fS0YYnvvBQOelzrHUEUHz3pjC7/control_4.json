Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. \n\nFirst, the setup: She's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's okay feeding him when he comes over. But when Chris's family unexpectedly arrives to pick him up, four more people show up, and they express hunger. The mom didn't prepare extra food, so she tells them to get takeout and leaves quickly.\n\nShe's feeling conflicted because she wants to help but doesn't want to be taken advantage of. She's considering reducing the frequency of Chris's visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's think about the key points. Did she have a prior agreement with Chris's family? It seems like Chris comes over often, but his family didn't notify her in advance. They just showed up, expecting to be fed? The mom didn't cook for them, which might be reasonable because it's a surprise. She offered takeout, which is a polite way to handle it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family was in a tight spot. But the father said \"not really\" when asked if they had dinner planned. That suggests they might not have. But the mom might not be responsible for feeding a family that didn't communicate their needs beforehand. It's one thing to feed a friend, but four unexpected guests could be a stretch.\n\nAlso, she's managing her household and resources. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially if it's recurring. The mom's actions seem practical. She's not being rude by sending them to get takeout after they left. She's also adjusting her son's interactions to prevent future issues, which is a valid decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B. She's not in the wrong because she handled it politely, considered the unexpected situation, and made a reasonable choice to protect her household's resources.\n"
