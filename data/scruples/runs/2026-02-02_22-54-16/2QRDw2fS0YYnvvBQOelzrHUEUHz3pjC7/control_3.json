Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the mom is wrong for not feeding the extra four people when Chris's family showed up unexpectedly. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The mom is cooking a lot for her own kids. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's already feeding him when he comes over. Then Chris's family shows up to pick him up, and the siblings get hungry. She didn't plan to cook for four more people. She tells them their parents probably have dinner planned and then suggests takeout, ushering them out.\n\nNow, considering the mom's perspective, she's managing her household, her own family's meals, and didn't plan for extra guests. She's being polite but firm. She reduces the frequency of Chris's visits after this incident. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom one angle, she's under no obligation to feed others. It's her home, and she's not responsible for feeding Chris's family unless she invited them. She handled it diplomatically, deflecting to their parents. The father's response was \"not really,\" which might imply they don't have plans, but she still wasn't responsible to provide. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation of hospitality when someone's family comes to pick up their child. But the mom made it clear she wasn't cooking for them. She even offered takeout as an alternative. Some might see her as stingy, but others might think she's justified in not having to take care of unexpected guests.\n\nThe key points are: She didn't invite them, she's already managing her own family's meals, and she handled the situation politely. The father's response might have been awkward, but the mom isn't at fault here. So, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
