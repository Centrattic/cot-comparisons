Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding the extra four people when Chris's family showed up. So, the situation is she's a mom to three kids, which are teenagers and a preteen, and they eat a lot. Chris is a friend of her son who isn't well off and comes over often. She's used to feeding one more person. Then Chris's family shows up, four people, and they end up at her doorstep. She didn't prepare food for them, and when they mention being hungry, she tells them to get takeout. Then she decides to cut down on Chris's visits.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the mom is already cooking for her own family. Chris comes over four times a week, and she's feeding him. Now, when Chris's family arrives unexpectedly, she didn't cook for them. She politely said they should have dinner planned, but the father said they didn't. Then she suggested takeout and ushered them out.\n\nIs she at fault? Well, she didn't have the capacity to feed four extra people on short notice. She's a single parent with three kids. Maybe she's not obligated to feed them. But maybe there's a social expectation when someone brings their whole family to your home without prior notice. The family commented on the nice house and the smell of food. Maybe they expected her to offer some food. But she did respond by suggesting takeout, which could be seen as a polite refusal. She didn't let them stay, but she didn't offer food either.\n\nAnother angle: Did Chris's family have a right to expect a meal? If they came to pick up Chris, maybe they didn't expect a full meal, but the comment about hunger might have been a test. The mom could have offered a snack or something, but if she didn't have food prepared, that's understandable. However, in some cultures, hospitality might require offering at least something. But the mom is making a choice to protect her resources and not overextend. She's also trying to limit future visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nAlso, the mom's reaction after is to reduce the frequency of Chris's visits. That could be seen as a reasonable step to prevent future issues. But maybe she could have handled it differently, like offering to feed them if they needed, but perhaps she's concerned about financial strain. The key points are her right to manage her household and the unexpected nature of the visit. Since she didn't have prior notice, it's not her fault. She's not obligated to feed them, especially if it's not planned. So I think she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
