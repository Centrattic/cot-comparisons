Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the mom not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. She had already prepared for Chris but not for four more people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids, which means she's already cooking a lot. Chris comes over often, and there's a sense that she's being generous by feeding him. But when Chris's family arrives unannounced, she's not prepared for four more people. She politely suggests they leave to order takeout, which seems reasonable because she hadn't planned to feed them.\n\nThe key points here: Was she obligated to feed them? Probably not. They showed up without prior notice, and she had no reason to expect them. Her response was diplomatic, even suggesting takeout and urging them to leave. She also adjusted her son's interactions with Chris to prevent future issues, which makes sense for her household's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel they were turned away when they were hungry. But the mom isn't responsible for their circumstances. She was kind but firm, and her actions protect her own family's needs. There's no indication she was rude, just that she refused to accommodate an unexpected situation she wasn't prepared for.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
