Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced.\n\nFirst, she's a mom with three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. Chris comes over often, and she's happy to feed him. But when Chris's family arrives unexpectedly with two more kids, she's not prepared. She tries to be polite, saying her parents will have dinner, but they respond that they don't really have plans. She then tells them to get takeout and ushers them out. After that, she decides to limit Chris's visits.\n\nNow, considering her situation: she's managing a household with teenagers who eat a lot. Adding four more people without prior notice would be a big burden. She didn't cook for them, so she's being honest when she tells them to get takeout. She's also setting boundaries by reducing the frequency of Chris's visits. \n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family is in a tough situation financially. They might be looking for help, but the mom isn't obligated to provide it. She wasn't rude, just firm. She even tried to be diplomatic. The key here is that she didn't have the capacity to host more people that day. \n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. I think she's not because she's protecting her family's resources and setting necessary boundaries. She didn't turn them away without offering help, but she was realistic about her situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
