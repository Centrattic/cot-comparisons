Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: The mom has three kids, including teenagers who eat a lot. She regularly feeds Chris, a friend of her son. Chris's family comes over unexpectedly, including parents and two siblings. They mention being hungry, but she didn't cook for them, told them to get takeout, and then cut back on Chris's visits.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and expectations. The mom wasn't expecting four extra people, so she wasn't prepared. She politely declined when they mentioned hunger, which is understandable. She's managing her household and resources. The father said they weren't planning dinner, which might be their problem. The mom's response was to send them for takeout and close the door. \n\nNow, some might argue that she should have offered food regardless, but others would say that she's under no obligation to feed guests who showed up without notice. Also, considering her own family's needs and the fact that they weren't invited, the mom's actions seem reasonable. She's protecting her household's resources and setting a boundary to prevent future surprises. \n\nThe mom feels conflicted because she doesn't want to be unkind, but she did the best she could with the situation. It's about personal responsibility\u2014Chris's family should have planned ahead, and the mom isn't responsible for their lack of planning. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, she's not in the wrong). She handled it politely and took steps to avoid similar situations. The fault might lie more with Chris's family for showing up unannounced and unprepared.\n"
