Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom with three kids, so she's already managing a lot. She's feeding her own family and occasionally her son's friend, Chris. But when Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with two siblings, that's four extra people. She hadn't planned for them, so she politely declines, offering a suggestion about takeout. \n\nFirst, the situation is about unexpected guests. The author didn't expect four more people, which could be a big inconvenience. She's a mom, so her primary responsibility is to her own family. She's already cooking a lot for her three kids. It's reasonable that she didn't cook for more people. The dad's response about not having a nice dinner planned adds a layer\u2014maybe they're in a bad situation, but that's not the author's responsibility. She tried to be diplomatic by suggesting takeout and moving the family along. \n\nThen she decides to limit Chris's visits to avoid similar situations. That's her way of setting boundaries. People might judge her, but she's managing her household. She's not being cruel by not feeding them; she's making a choice to protect her family's time and resources. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have been more accommodating. But realistically, unexpected guests can't always be expected to be fed. The key here is that she didn't have them over for a reason, and she handled it politely. She's not in the wrong because she's within her rights to set boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
