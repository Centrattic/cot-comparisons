Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly.\n\nSo, the situation is: The mom has two teenagers and a preteen, so she's already cooking a lot. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's okay feeding one more. But this time, Chris's parents and two siblings showed up unannounced. They mentioned they weren't going to have dinner. The mom didn't cook for four extra people, told them to get takeout, and now she's feeling conflicted about cutting back on Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She's already under a lot of stress with feeding her own kids. Unexpected guests can be a burden, especially if you didn't plan for them. She politely declined, which makes sense because she wasn't prepared. It's not her fault that her son's friend has family in a tough spot financially, but she's not obligated to feed them, especially on short notice.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family was in a difficult situation and couldn't afford food. But the mom didn't have the resources to feed them, and she's already managing her own family's meals. She handled it politely by suggesting takeout and encouraging them to leave so they could get food. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe mom's decision to reduce Chris's visits might be seen as a way to avoid future issues. She's being proactive to prevent similar situations. However, some might argue that she's punishing Chris for his family's circumstances. But she's the one who has to deal with the daily cooking, so it's her home and her rules.\n\nI think the key points here are that she's not obligated to feed others on short notice, especially when it's not her fault. She handled the situation as respectfully as possible given the circumstances. So, I don't think she's in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
