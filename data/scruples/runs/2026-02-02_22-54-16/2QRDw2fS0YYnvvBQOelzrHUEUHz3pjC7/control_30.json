Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's a mom with three kids, already cooking a lot. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often. His family comes to pick him up, but then they all stay, not expecting to be fed. The mom didn't prepare for four extra people. She tries to politely send them on their way, and then later reduces the frequency of Chris's visits. \n\nSo, the key points here are about expectation of hospitality, financial constraints, and the suddenness of the guests. The mom is managing her household and resources, which includes feeding her own family. She didn't plan for four extra people, and when asked, she's honest that she didn't cook for them. Her response is to suggest takeout and then to limit future visits.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around hospitality. In many cultures, showing guests food is important, but if the guests didn't announce their arrival, expecting the host to accommodate them might be unrealistic. However, the family came to pick up Chris, not to eat. The parents didn't ask if they could stay for dinner. The mom's response seems reasonable because she wasn't expecting them to stay. \n\nThe father's comment \"not really\" when asked about dinner might imply they were in a tough spot, but the mom isn't obligated to feed them just because they mention they're hungry. She could offer a snack or something quick, but she's already stretched thin with her own kids. \n\nThe mom's decision to limit future visits might be seen as cutting off a friend's family, but she's setting boundaries to avoid similar situations. It's about personal limits and not feeling taken advantage of. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Probably not. She's in a difficult position, managing her household, and the guests didn't give prior notice. The parents might have expected her to handle it, but without prior communication, it's not her fault. She handled it politely and then adjusted her behavior to prevent future issues. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
