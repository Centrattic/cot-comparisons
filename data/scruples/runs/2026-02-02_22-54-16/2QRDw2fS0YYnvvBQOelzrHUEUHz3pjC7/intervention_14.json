Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom with three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son, and his family isn't well off. Recently, when Chris's family came over, they ended up showing up unannounced, and the mom had to deal with it. She didn't cook for them, tried to send them away politely, and now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether she did something wrong. The key points here are her responsibility as a host, the unexpected guests, and her reaction. She mentions she hadn't planned for four extra people. It's normal for someone to have boundaries about their home, especially when unexpected guests come. Her response was polite but firm, which is reasonable. She even suggested takeout and urged them to leave, which shows she tried to be helpful.\n\nBut maybe some people would see it as mean to not offer food to someone who might be struggling financially. However, the mother isn't responsible for feeding everyone who comes through her door. She's already managing her own family's needs. The father's comment about not having dinner planned adds to the situation, but it's not the mother's obligation to provide for others. \n\nHer decision to limit future visits is a boundary, which is okay. People need to set limits to protect their resources and space. While she might feel guilty, she isn't in the wrong for not accommodating the unexpected guests. So the answer is B.\n"
