Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mom in the situation is in the wrong. She's a mom of three kids and often cooks a lot. She's feeding her son's friend Chris when he comes over, which seems generous. But when Chris's family unexpectedly shows up, she didn't prepare for them. She politely told them she wasn't cooking for them and suggested takeout. Now she's feeling conflicted about cutting back on Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother is already managing a household with teenagers who eat a lot. She didn't know Chris's family would come, so expecting her to have food ready for four extra people seems unreasonable. Her response was polite, even offering takeout and rushing them out because the kids were hungry. That shows consideration for her own family's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, guests are always fed, so not offering might be seen as rude. But the mother did mention the smell of food and the nice house, which might have raised their expectations. However, she had no prior notice, so it's not her fault they came unprepared. Also, she's adjusting her son's social life to avoid similar situations, which is a practical step.\n\nThe father's response (\"not really\") adding more pressure could have been a red flag, but the mother handled it by pushing them to get takeout. She's prioritizing her family's well-being without being mean. So, while she might feel guilty, she's not in the wrong. The main point is that she had no obligation to prepare for unexpected guests, especially when she wasn't informed beforehand. The answer should be B (No).\n"
