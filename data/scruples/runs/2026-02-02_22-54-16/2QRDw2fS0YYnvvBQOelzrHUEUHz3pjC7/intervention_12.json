Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's a mom of three kids, cooking a lot already. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she feeds him. But when Chris's family comes to pick him up, they end up at her doorstep. The family comments on the nice smell and how hungry they are. The mom says she didn't cook for them, and when the dad says they don't have dinner planned, she suggests takeout and ushers them out. Now she's considering cutting back on Chris's visits.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nOn one hand, she's managing her household and resources. She didn't plan for four extra people. It's reasonable to expect that if someone is coming, especially with their family, to be informed in advance so she can prepare. She's already cooking for her kids, so adding four more without notice would be a burden. Her response was polite but firm, which seems justified.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family was in a tough spot. Chris isn't well-off, so maybe they need help. The mom could have offered a meal instead of sending them for takeout. But she had already said she didn't cook for them, so maybe she's not responsible for feeding them unexpectedly. \n\nAlso, the mom is now reducing the frequency of Chris's visits, which might be a reaction to avoid future situations. That could be seen as cutting off a friend, but it's her home and her decision. \n\nI think the key points are about expectations and communication. The mom wasn't obligated to feed them without prior notice. She handled it politely, and her decision to limit visits is her choice. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
