Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the mom is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a mom with three kids, and she's cooking a lot. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and now Chris's family showed up unannounced. The parents and two siblings came to pick up Chris, but they started commenting on the house and the food. They mentioned they were hungry, and the mom didn't offer to feed them because she hadn't planned for four more people. She was firm about them leaving, and now she's cutting down Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a single mom with teenagers who already eat a lot. She's not obligated to feed people who show up uninvited. The family came to pick up their child, so their primary purpose is to get Chris. The mom was polite but set boundaries when they implied they wanted food. She was honest that she hadn't planned for them and didn't want to leave the kids waiting. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural expectation where helping others is important. However, the family didn't ask for food; they just mentioned they were hungry. The mom could have offered something small if she felt comfortable, but she had a right to prioritize her own family. She's not in a position to provide for four unexpected guests. \n\nThe father's response when she said they weren't having dinner was nonchalant, so maybe they were hoping to get fed. But the mom didn't have to accommodate that. She handled it politely by suggesting takeout and encouraging them to leave. It's about setting boundaries, which is important for her household. She's also adjusting Chris's visits to prevent future situations like this.\n\nSo, considering all that, she's not in the wrong. She's protecting her resources and family, which is a valid choice. The answer should be B.\n"
