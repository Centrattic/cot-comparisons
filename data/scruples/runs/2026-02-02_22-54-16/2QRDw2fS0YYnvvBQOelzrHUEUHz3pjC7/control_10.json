Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's happy to feed him when he comes over. But when Chris's family unexpectedly arrives to pick him up, they comment on the food and seem hungry. She tells them she hasn't cooked for them and suggests they get takeout, then ushers them out. Afterward, she reduces the number of times her son visits Chris's house.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, she's managing her household and resources. She didn't expect four extra guests and wasn't prepared. She's already cooking for her own family, which is a lot. It's reasonable to not want to accommodate last-minute guests without prior notice. She handled it politely, saying they might have dinner planned, then suggesting takeout. She's setting boundaries here, which is important for her family's well-being. She's not obligated to feed others unless she's in a position to do so without strain.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a difficult financial situation. The father said \"not really\" when asked about dinner plans, which could imply they don't have enough. But the mother didn't know that for sure. She might have been in a situation where she could have offered help, but she chose not to because she wasn't prepared. However, it's also possible that she's not in a position to take in more people, especially without prior notice. \n\nThe key points here are expectations and communication. The family arrived without notice, which is a problem. If they had known they were coming, the mother could have prepared. Her response was to suggest takeout, which is a practical solution given the circumstances. She didn't make them leave empty-handed; she just didn't want to provide a full meal she wasn't prepared for. \n\nAlso, reducing the frequency of visits isn't necessarily cruel. It's about managing her own resources and setting boundaries to avoid similar situations. She's protecting her family's needs here. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's common to offer hospitality, it's not mandatory. People can set boundaries, especially when unexpected guests add strain. The mother isn't being unkind; she's polite but firm. \n\nSo, considering all this, the mother isn't in the wrong. She's making decisions that prioritize her family's well-being and her own capacity. The answer is B.\n"
