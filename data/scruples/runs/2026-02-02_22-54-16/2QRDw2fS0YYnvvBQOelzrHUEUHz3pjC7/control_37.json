Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom in this situation is in the wrong. The main issue is that she didn't feed the unexpected guests when they came to pick up Chris. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mom has three kids, including teenagers who eat a lot. That's a lot of mouths to feed already. Then Chris comes over often, but now his whole family showed up unannounced. She didn't cook for them, and she handled it by telling them to get takeout. She later reduced the number of Chris's visits.\n\nThe question is whether she's wrong. On one hand, she's doing her best for her family. She's not obligated to feed people who weren't expected. Her response was polite but firm. She even offered takeout as an alternative. On the other hand, the family might have been in a tough spot, and she could have felt bad for them. But she's also managing her household and resources.\n\nI think she's not in the wrong because she handled it respectfully without being rude. She's responsible for her family's needs first. The problem is the unexpected guests, not her response. So the answer should be B.\n"
