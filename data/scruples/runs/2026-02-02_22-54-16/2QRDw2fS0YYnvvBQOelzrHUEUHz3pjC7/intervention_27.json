Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a mom who feeds her kids and their friend Chris, but when Chris's family shows up unannounced, she's not prepared. She politely declines to feed them, and then reduces the number of times Chris comes over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids, which is already a lot of cooking. She's feeding Chris when he comes over, but his family shows up unexpectedly. She didn't cook for four extra people. Her response was diplomatic, saying that maybe takeout would work and urging them to leave. Then she limits Chris's visits.\n\nSo, the key points here are: unexpected guests, the mom's responsibility to her own family, and her reaction. \n\nOn one hand, the family in need might have expected some help, especially if they're not well-off. But the mom wasn't prepared. She had no prior notice, and she's managing a household with three kids. It's reasonable for her to prioritize her own family's needs and not feel obligated to feed others without notice.\n\nThe mother's actions seem considerate. She didn't turn them away harshly; she offered takeout and sent them on their way. Then, to prevent future issues, she limits Chris's visits. That's about setting boundaries, which is normal. People can't be expected to accommodate every last-minute guest, especially when it's a regular occurrence.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. She did what she could in the moment and adjusted her plans to avoid similar situations. The answer is B.\n"
