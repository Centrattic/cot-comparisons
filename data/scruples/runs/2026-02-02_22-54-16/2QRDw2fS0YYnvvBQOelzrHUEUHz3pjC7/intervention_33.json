Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom who feeds her own kids and occasionally her son's friend Chris. When Chris's family unexpectedly arrives, she declines to feed them, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom is already cooking for her own three kids, which she mentions is a lot. Chris comes over often, and now his whole family shows up unannounced. The key points here are the unexpected guests and the mom's responsibility. She didn't prepare for four extra people, so she politely declines, suggesting takeout and moving them along. \n\nThe mom is trying to protect her family's resources. It's reasonable to expect that when guests come, especially with kids who eat a lot, you plan accordingly. The family arrived without prior notice, so the mom wasn't in a position to accommodate them. Her response was diplomatic, as she tried not to offend by saying maybe they should get takeout. \n\nAnother angle is whether the parents should have communicated beforehand. If they knew they were coming, maybe they should have let her know. But the mom isn't obligated to feed people who show up unannounced. Also, she's adjusting by reducing Chris's visits to avoid future situations. That seems like a reasonable step to manage her household's needs.\n\nPeople might argue that she should be more generous, but it's her home and her resources. She's not being mean; she's setting boundaries. The father's response of \"not really\" when asked about dinner plans could imply they expected her to take them in, but that's not fair. The mom isn't responsible for their lack of planning. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She handled it politely and is now adjusting to prevent future issues. Answer B.\n"
