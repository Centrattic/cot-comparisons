Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mom who's hosting her son's friend's family unexpectedly and deciding not to feed them, then reducing the friend's visits. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom is already cooking a lot for her own teenagers, so adding four more people on short notice might be a burden. She tried to be diplomatic by suggesting they take out food and urged them to leave because the kids were hungry. That seems respectful.\n\nThen, she told her son to limit Chris's visits. The key points here are that she's managing her household's needs and setting boundaries. She didn't invite them, and they showed up unannounced. The parents didn't seem to plan ahead, expecting her to accommodate them without notice. \n\nIs it her responsibility to feed everyone who comes through the door? Probably not. She's under no obligation to host or feed them. The father's response about not having dinner planned might imply they were relying on her, which could be part of the issue. \n\nFeeling like an asshole is common in these situations because people often worry about appearing unkind. But she's prioritizing her family's well-being. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she's within her rights to set boundaries and didn't act rudely. The family came uninvited, so she's not obligated to host them.\n"
