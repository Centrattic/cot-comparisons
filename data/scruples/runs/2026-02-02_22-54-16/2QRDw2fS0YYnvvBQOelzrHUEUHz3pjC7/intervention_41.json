Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. So, the scenario is that the mom regularly feeds Chris, a son's friend, but when Chris's whole family arrives unannounced, she didn't cook for them and actually sent them away, telling her son to limit Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids, which means she's already cooking a lot. Chris comes over frequently, so she's used to that. But when Chris's entire family shows up without notice, that's an unexpected burden. She didn't cook for four extra people, which makes sense because it's last minute. Her response was polite but firm, suggesting takeout and urging them to leave. \n\nFrom a practical standpoint, it's reasonable for her to expect that if someone is coming over, especially with family, they should communicate in advance so she can prepare. The family just arrived, commented on the food, and didn't seem to respect her situation. She's not obligated to feed them, especially if it wasn't planned. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural expectation here. Some people might view offering food as a social obligation, even if it's inconvenient. However, the mom was clear that she hadn't prepared for four more people. She was polite but set boundaries. The father's response was dismissive, which might have added to her frustration. \n\nAlso, the mom's decision to limit Chris's visits seems self-preservation. She's trying to avoid similar situations. The user thinks she's not in the wrong, and I agree. She's managing her household and resources as she sees fit. It's about setting boundaries, which is important for personal and family well-being. \n\nSo, the answer is B. She's not in the wrong. She handled it as reasonably as possible given the circumstances.\n"
