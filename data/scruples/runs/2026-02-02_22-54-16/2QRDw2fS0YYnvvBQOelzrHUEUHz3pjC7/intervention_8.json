Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom who's feeding her own kids and sometimes a friend of her son, Chris. Then Chris's entire family shows up unexpectedly, and she didn't plan to feed them. She politely told them her parents probably had dinner planned and suggested takeout. Now she's cut down on Chris visiting and feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The mom is responsible for her own family's meals, which is a lot with teenagers. Chris comes over often, and she's okay feeding one more. But when the whole family shows up unannounced, she wasn't prepared. She tried to handle it politely, but the dad said they weren't going to have dinner. She then sent them on their way. Now she's limiting Chris's visits to avoid this happening again. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she's managing her own household and responsibilities. She didn't expect four extra people, so not preparing for them makes sense. She didn't want to be rude, but she had to prioritize her family and her resources. The family was aware they were just picking up Chris but ended up expecting a meal, which might not be fair. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family shouldn't have come without planning, but the mom did mention the food smell and maybe they thought they could stay. However, she already stated she wasn't cooking for them. The dad's response about not having dinner planned might be a way to pressure her into feeding them, which she refused. \n\nThe user thinks she's not in the wrong. I agree. She's within her rights to set boundaries. She handled it politely, and it's reasonable to adjust Chris's visits to prevent future issues. The family's approach was probably inconsiderate, so the mom isn't at fault.\n"
