Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding the additional family members who showed up unannounced. \n\nFirst, the situation: she has three kids, so cooking already happens a lot. Chris, a poor friend of her son, comes over often, which she's okay with feeding. But when Chris's family arrives unexpectedly with two more kids, they comment on the food smell and hunger. She politely says she didn't cook for them and suggests takeout, then asks them to leave. She reduces Chris's visits to avoid this again.\n\nThe key points here are consent and expectations. The mom didn't invite the family, and they came without prior notice. She had prepared food for her family and Chris, not four extra people. Her response was polite but firm, which makes sense because she's responsible for her own household. \n\nSome might say she's being inconsiderate because the family is poor, but she's not obligated to feed people she hasn't invited. The father's comment about not having dinner planned might add pressure, but that's their responsibility, not hers. The mom is managing her resources as she sees fit. She's also trying to set boundaries to prevent future issues, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the flip side, someone might argue that offering food to those in need is a moral duty. However, the scenario doesn't indicate that the family asked for help; they just made a comment about hunger. The mom isn't refusing to help if they asked, but she's not responsible for their situation or their expectations. \n\nHer actions seem justifiable. She handled it politely and is adjusting future interactions to avoid discomfort. So, the answer is B.\n"
