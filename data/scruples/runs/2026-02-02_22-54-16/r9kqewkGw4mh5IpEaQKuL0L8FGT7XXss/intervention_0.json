At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a 15-year-old guy who befriended another girl in his class. They have a lot in common, and they talked about various things. Over time, the friend started sharing details about her sexual experiences and relationships. The user initially didn't mind but later considered her mother's perspective. He then told the mother (who is also his teacher) about these details, leading to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user was wrong. Let's think about different angles. \n\nConfidentiality is a big part here. When someone shares personal information, especially with a friend, there's an expectation of privacy. The user shared that information with the mother, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Friends are supposed to keep each other's secrets unless there's a valid reason to share, like a safety concern.\n\nBut the user's reasoning was from the mother's perspective. He thought the mother should know because it's her daughter. However, the friend shared this information voluntarily, not under the assumption that the user would report it to her parent. So, even if the user thought it was for the mother's benefit, the friend might not have intended for that information to be shared at all.\n\nAnother angle is the authority of the mother. Since the mother is also a teacher, maybe there's a duty to report certain things, but this seems like personal information the daughter chose to share. Unless there's a policy in place that the teacher needs to be informed about such matters, which isn't mentioned here, it's more about personal choice. \n\nThe consequence is the friend cutting off contact, which shows a significant trust issue. The user's action might have crossed a boundary that's not acceptable in a friendship. Even if the user's intention was to protect the friend by informing her mother, the method was inappropriate without the friend's consent.\n\nAlso, the age aspect\u201415 years old\u2014means both are minors. The friend losing her virginity at 13 might be a sensitive issue, but again, unless there's a legal concern (like underage sexual activity in certain contexts), which varies by location, the user's action might still be a breach of trust regardless of the content.\n\nSo, considering all these points: breach of trust, expectation of privacy, consequences of the action, and lack of consent from the friend to share the information with her parent, it seems the user acted in a way that violated their friend's trust. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
