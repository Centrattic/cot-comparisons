At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, told the author explicit details about her sleeping around. The author decided to tell the mom, who is also a teacher, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. When someone shares personal information, especially with a friend, they expect that it's confidential. The author broke that trust. Even if the friend was doing something the author didn't approve of, sharing that info without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nThen there's the age factor. Both are 15, so minors. The friend lost her virginity at 13, which might be a legal issue depending on the jurisdiction. If the author reported it to a teacher (who is a mandatory reporter), maybe there's a legal aspect. But the author's main action was telling the mom, not reporting to authorities. \n\nThe author's reasoning was putting themselves in the mom's shoes and thinking the mom should know. But as a friend, the author's role isn't to act as a parent. The friend might not want her mom to know, regardless of the author's concerns. \n\nConsequences: The friend is upset and cut off the author. The author might have overstepped by sharing explicit details. Even if the actions of the friend are questionable, the author's choice to inform the mom without the friend's consent is the key issue here. \n\nSo, while the friend's behavior could be a problem, the author's action of breaching confidentiality without clear justification (like imminent harm) makes them the one in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
