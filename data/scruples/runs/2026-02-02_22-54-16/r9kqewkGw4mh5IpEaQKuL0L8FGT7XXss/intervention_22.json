At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 15-year-old boy who told his friend's mom about her daughter's explicit sexual activities. The friend mentioned sleeping around and losing her virginity at 13, and the author told the mom because he thought that's what a parent would want to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals involved. Both are 15, which is a minor, so their ability to make mature decisions might be questionable. The friend losing her virginity at 13 is under the age of consent in many places, which could be a legal issue. However, the author isn't the one engaging in the activity; he's the one who reported it. \n\nNext, the author's intent. He did it because he thought the mother should know. It seems like he was trying to do the right thing from a parental perspective. But did he overstep? Sharing someone's private information without their consent is generally a violation of trust. Even if it's for a \"good\" reason, it's still a breach of privacy. \n\nThen there's the aspect of being a friend. Friends are supposed to keep each other's confidence unless there's a danger involved. The author chose to reveal personal details that weren't harmful to others, just private. So, the friend felt betrayed, which is understandable. Even if the mother believed the daughter was making things up at first, the act of informing the parent damaged the trust between the two friends.\n\nAlso, the author is a minor himself. He might not fully grasp the consequences of his actions. But that doesn't excuse it. The key issue here is whether the information shared posed an immediate risk to the friend or others. If the friend was engaging in risky behavior that endangered herself or others, maybe the author had a valid reason. However, just sleeping around doesn't automatically mean illegal activity unless there's underage sexual activity involved. The friend was 13 when she lost her virginity, which could be illegal depending on the jurisdiction. If the author knew that and reported it, maybe he was trying to prevent harm. But if the friend is now 15, and the incident was in the past, the legality might not be an issue anymore unless there's ongoing activity with underage partners.\n\nAnother angle is the author's role as a friend. Even if he had good intentions, breaking someone's confidence can have serious repercussions. The friend's right to privacy is important. Unless there's a clear and present danger, friends might not have the right to report each other's private matters to their parents.\n\nIn terms of the response, the community typically values trust and respect between friends. So, even if the author thought he was doing the right thing, the method was inappropriate. The answer here might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he violated trust without a legal necessity, even if his intentions were good.\n"
