At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. So, the situation is that a 15-year-old girl told her friend in detail about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. The friend, another 15-year-old, then told the girl's mom, who is also their teacher. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl was 13, that's below the age of consent. So, if there was actual sexual activity, that might be a legal issue. But the friend didn't know if the mom was aware. However, the friend didn't report to authorities but told the mom directly. \n\nThen there's the aspect of trust and confidentiality. Friends often share personal things expecting it to stay between them. By sharing this information with the mother, the friend broke that trust. Even if the friend had good intentions, like protecting the girl or her mom, the method of handling it was to go straight to the mom without involving any authority or maybe the school. \n\nAlso, the friend might have thought they were doing the right thing, but using another teacher as a go-between might not be the best approach. The mother started off thinking the daughter was making things up but later believed it. The friend's actions led to the loss of their friendship and potentially embarrassed or harmed the girl's reputation. \n\nBut legally, if the girl was engaging in underage sexual activity, the friend might have a duty to report it. However, since the friend is a peer, they might not be responsible for that. The legal duty usually falls on adults or authorities. So, maybe the friend overstepped by not involving proper channels.\n\nAlso, the friend didn't confront the girl first or give her a chance to address it. They just went straight to her mom. That's a breach of trust. Even if the friend was concerned, the method was problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the friend's action of snitching without proper channels and breaking trust might make them the asshole. They should have handled it differently, maybe by talking to a trusted adult first, but going to the mom directly caused harm to the relationship and possibly violated the girl's privacy.\n"
