At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for tattling on their friend to her mom. The friend was talking a lot about her sexual activities, and the author felt the mom should know. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15, same as the friend. They shared personal details, and the author decided to inform the mom. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nPrivacy is a big factor here. The friend shared her experiences with the author, expecting some level of confidentiality. By telling the mom, the author broke that trust. Even if the author thought it was for the friend's own good, without being asked, it's a breach.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning was from the mom's perspective. But the mom is also a teacher, which adds another layer. The author might have thought the teacher had a responsibility to know, but the friend's personal life isn't necessarily the school's business unless there's actual harm or danger.\n\nThe consequences are clear: the friend is upset and won't talk to the author anymore. That's a direct result of the author's actions. Even if the author had good intentions, the method was wrong. Trust is crucial in friendships, and once it's broken, it's hard to mend.\n\nAge-wise, both are minors, but that doesn't excuse the breach of trust. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by protecting the friend from her mother's potential reaction, but it's not their place to decide that. The mom has the right to be informed if there are concerns, but the author might not have the authority to act as a judge here.\n\nIn most cases, spreading someone's private information without consent is considered wrong, even if the intent is good. The situation doesn't indicate any immediate harm or illegal activity, just personal choices. So, the author's action of revealing the friend's private details without her consent is likely the wrong move.\n"
