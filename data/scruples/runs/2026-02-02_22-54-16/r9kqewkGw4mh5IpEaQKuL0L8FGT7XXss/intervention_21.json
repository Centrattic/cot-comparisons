At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation is that the friend, also 15, was talking about sleeping around and losing her virginity at 13. The author told the mom, who's also a teacher, and now the friend is upset and doesn't talk to them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the friend lost her virginity at 13, that might be a legal issue depending on the laws there. If the author reported it because they suspected underage sexual activity, maybe they had a reason to inform a trusted adult like a teacher or parent. But the author isn't a parent or authority figure, so whether they had the right to do that is a question.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust and friendship. The friend shared personal details with the author, expecting confidentiality. By revealing that information, the author broke that trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, the method of handling it might be questionable. Was there another way to address concerns without directly informing the mother?\n\nAlso, the mother was a teacher, so maybe the author felt it was their duty to report something that could be a legal issue. But the friend didn't ask for help, so it's unclear if it was an actual problem or just the author's judgment. The author might have overstepped by sharing personal information without considering the friend's autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend was engaging in risky behavior, the author might have a valid concern for her well-being. However, the approach taken could have been different, like advising the friend to talk to a parent or trusted adult themselves.\n\nSo balancing the friend's privacy and the author's intentions, it seems like the author broke trust and may have acted without the friend's consent. Even if the motive was good, the action of snitching without the friend's permission could make the author responsible for the fallout. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong), but there's nuance depending on context like local laws and the situation's specifics.\n"
