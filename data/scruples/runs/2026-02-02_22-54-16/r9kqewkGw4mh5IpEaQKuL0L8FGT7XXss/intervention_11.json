At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 15-year-old boy who made friends with a girl in his class. They bond over shared interests and eventually the girl starts talking about her relationships, including sleeping around, losing her virginity at 13, and now wanting to get with her BFF (who is a guy). The author kept quiet for a month but then decided to tell the girl's mom (who is also his teacher) in explicit detail because he thought her mom would want to know. The mom initially didn't believe but later did, and now the friend is upset and refuses to talk to the author. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are: confidential information shared with a friend, the author's intent to inform the parent (deeming it necessary), the friend's reaction, and the author's justification from the parent's perspective.\n\nFirst, the author was told things in confidence. When someone shares personal details with you, especially a friend, there's an implicit trust that they won't be shared. The author decided to break that trust by telling the mother without the friend's consent. Even if the author thought it was for a good reason (protecting the friend's well-being, maybe?), the act of disclosing private information without permission is a breach of trust.\n\nNow, the author's reasoning: he considered the mother's perspective and thought she would want to know if her daughter was engaging in sexual activity, especially at a young age. But at 15, the author isn't in a position to make that judgment for the parent. The mother could have been approached discreetly to express concern, perhaps, but directly revealing explicit details might be overstepping. The mother might have preferred to talk to her daughter directly or handle it in her own way. The author's action could have caused unnecessary harm to the friend, damaging the relationship and possibly leading to family issues.\n\nAlso, the friend is 15, so the age of consent varies by location, but in many places, 13 is below the age of majority. However, the author's main issue here is the breach of confidentiality. Even if the mother is also a teacher, the author's duty to the friend's privacy should take precedence unless there's a legal obligation to report (like if there's underage activity involving a minor, which the author might have thought was the case). But even then, in many jurisdictions, a teacher might have a duty to report, but the student isn't in that position. The author isn't a mandated reporter unless they are in a specific role like a teacher or care worker, which the author isn't\u2014the mother is the teacher.\n\nSo the author, as a peer, deciding to inform the mother without the friend's knowledge is crossing a line. The friend's autonomy and privacy are important. The author might have thought he was doing the right thing, but without proper channels or consent, it's a breach of trust. The friend's reaction is understandable\u2014being betrayed by someone they trusted. The author's action likely caused more harm than good, and the friendship was ended because of it.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he violated his friend's trust by sharing private information without her consent, even if he had good intentions. The correct choice is A.\n"
