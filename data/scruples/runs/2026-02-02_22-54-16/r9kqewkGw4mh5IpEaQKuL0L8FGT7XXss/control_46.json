At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The friend is 15, and she told the author about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. The author then told the friend's mom, who is also a teacher. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author. The author is also 15, so they're both minors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information with you, especially a friend, there's an expectation of privacy. The author didn't ask the friend if it was okay to share that info with her mom. So, that might be a breach of trust. But the author's reasoning was that they thought the mom should know to protect the daughter, maybe from risky behavior. \n\nBut the author is a 15-year-old, so maybe they didn't fully understand the consequences. The friend's mom is a teacher, so there's a duty of care. However, the teacher might have already noticed something if the daughter was acting out. But the author wasn't the teacher; they made the decision to share private details without the friend's consent. \n\nThere's also the aspect of age. At 15, engaging in sexual activity might be illegal, but the author isn't the one doing that. However, the author's disclosure could have serious repercussions for the friend, like family conflict or legal issues if the mom reports it. \n\nThe author might have thought they were doing the right thing by informing the mother, but without the friend's consent, it's a violation of trust. Friends typically keep each other's secrets unless there's immediate harm. The author's action led to the friend cutting them off, which is a natural consequence of betrayal. \n\nSo, weighing the breach of trust against the possible intent to protect, the main issue is the lack of consent. Even if the motive was good, the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
