At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that the friend, who's 15, told the author in detail about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. The author then told her mom, who's also a teacher, and now the friend is upset and not talking to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age here. Both the author and the friend are 15, which is a minor. In many places, the legal age of consent is 16 or higher, so if she lost her virginity at 13, that might be a legal issue. If the author reported this to her mom, who's also a teacher, then the teacher has a duty to report child abuse or statutory rape if applicable. So maybe the author was trying to do the right thing by informing an adult about what might be illegal.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the friend told him voluntarily. If the author is just repeating what the friend said, and the mother/teacher is required to report such information, then maybe the author's action was necessary. However, the friend's privacy is also a factor. Even if the author thought he was right, sharing personal information without consent can damage trust. But the author might not be at fault if he believed he was preventing harm.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overstepped by not talking to the friend first or involving another authority figure in a way that could help without outing the friend. But if the author thought there was a legal issue, he had a responsibility to report. So it's a bit of a moral dilemma. The answer might depend on the legal context and whether the author had a duty to report. Since the mother is also a teacher, she might be mandated to report any suspicion of child abuse or underage sexual activity. Therefore, the author's action could be seen as responsible, even if it hurt the friendship. So the answer might be B, not the author's fault.\n"
