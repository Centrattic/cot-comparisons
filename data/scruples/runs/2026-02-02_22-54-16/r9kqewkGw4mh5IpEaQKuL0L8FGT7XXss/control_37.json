At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old who told his teacher (who is also his friend's mom) that his friend, also 15, sleeps around and lost her virginity at 13. The main question is whether he was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, the girl shared personal details with him. But even if someone shares something personal, that doesn't mean it's okay to share it with others without consent. Privacy is a big deal here. The user might have thought he was protecting her by informing the mom, but that's a gray area. \n\nAt 15, both the friends are minors. The user's action could be seen as violating trust. Even if he had good intentions, sharing such information can damage their friendship, which it did. The mom might have a right to know if there's something concerning, but the user isn't in a position to make that judgment. Also, the girl might not have wanted her mom to know these details.\n\nAnother angle: the user was worried about the girl's behavior from his perspective. But that's not a valid reason to breach confidentiality unless there's a legal obligation or immediate harm, which isn't mentioned here. The user's action led to the friend cutting off contact, showing a significant consequence.\n\nIn most cases, sharing someone else's private information without their consent is a breach of trust, regardless of intent. Even if the user thought he was helping, the method was wrong. The appropriate step might have been to talk to the girl about his concerns or involve a trusted adult in a different way, not directly tell her mom without her knowledge.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the user was in the wrong because he shared private information without consent, leading to a broken friendship and privacy invasion.\n"
