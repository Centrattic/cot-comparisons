At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15, and the author is also 15. The friend shared personal details about her relationships and sleeping around, and the author decided to tell her mom, who is also their teacher. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author. The question is whether snitching was the right move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a friend and was trusted with private information. By sharing that with the friend's mom, the author broke that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, like thinking the mom should know, the act of disclosing private information without consent is generally considered a breach of privacy and trust. \n\nAlso, the friend is a minor, so there might be some legal aspects here regarding confidentiality. However, since both are 15 and in school, maybe the teacher-mom's role complicates things. But the author isn't in a position of authority; they're a peer. So, even if the author thought it was for the friend's own good, the method of handling it was inappropriate. \n\nThe friend might have shared those details under the assumption of confidentiality. By telling her mom, the author violated that trust. The consequences are that the friendship is ruined. Even if the author's intention was to protect the friend by informing the parent, the right approach would have been different, like talking to the friend about their boundaries or maybe going through the teacher-mom in a more formal way if there were actual concerns about safety or legal issues. But since the friend's actions, while perhaps controversial, don't necessarily indicate harm, the author overstepped.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
