At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation involves the friend talking about sleeping around and the author telling her mom about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15, and so is their friend. They met in class, became friends, and the friend shared personal details about her sexual activity. The author felt it was necessary to inform the mother, who is also their teacher, which led to the friend being upset and cutting off contact.\n\nSo the main question is: was it right or wrong for the author to do that? On one hand, the author might have thought they were acting in the friend's best interest, maybe believing the mother should know for her daughter's safety. On the other hand, the author breached the friend's privacy, which is a big deal. \n\nThe friend shared personal information with the author, trusting them. By telling the mother, the author violated that trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, keeping such information private is usually expected unless there's a clear risk of harm. Since the friend is a minor, there might be a concern about her well-being, but the mother already knew about the breakup and her daughter's activities, maybe through other means. \n\nAlso, the mother initially thought the daughter was making things up, but then believed the author. The friend is now upset, which shows the impact of the author's action. The author might not have considered that their friend might not want this information shared, even if it's with a parent. \n\nIn terms of the law or school policies, sharing personal information of a peer could be a violation, especially if it's done without consent. The fact that the mother is a teacher adds complexity, but the author isn't in a position to decide what's best for the friend's family dynamics. \n\nSo, while the author might have had good intentions, the act of snitching without the friend's consent likely caused harm and broke trust. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
