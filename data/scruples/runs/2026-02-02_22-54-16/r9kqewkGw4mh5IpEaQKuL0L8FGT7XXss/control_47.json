At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old boy who told his friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is also 15, and he was the one who shared details about his relationships. The user thought about her mom's perspective and decided to inform her. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, they usually expect it to stay private. The friend might feel betrayed because the user broke that trust. Even if the user thought it was for her own good, sharing that info without consent can damage the friendship. \n\nThen there's the aspect of parental involvement. The mother is also a teacher, so there's a power dynamic here. The user might have felt it was necessary to protect the friend or her family. But at 15, the user isn't in a position to decide who gets to know what about someone else's life. The friend's mom is an adult and a teacher, so maybe she has a responsibility to know if the student is in a harmful situation. However, the user's role as a friend is to support, not to take it upon himself to inform parents without the friend's consent.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions\u2014sleeping around, losing virginity at 13\u2014are things that involve minors, which might be a legal concern. But the user isn't in a legal or authority position to report that. It's more the parents' or school's responsibility if there's something to report. \n\nThe user's intention was to protect, but the method was wrong. He didn't try to talk to the friend about his concerns first. Instead of being a friend, he took it upon himself to inform the mother, which can be seen as violating trust. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user had good intentions, he broke the trust of his friend without her consent. The action of \"snitching\" without discussing it with the friend first or seeking guidance from an adult (like a teacher or counselor) makes him responsible for the fallout. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
