At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old boy who shared explicit details about his friend's sexual activities with her mom, who's also a teacher. The friend is 15, so they're around the same age. The friend often talked about her previous relationships and losing her virginity at 13. The user felt it was important to inform the mom, thinking from her perspective. Now the friend is upset and doesn't talk to him anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are teenagers, so their understanding of privacy and consent might be different. However, the user shared personal and sensitive information without the friend's consent. Even if he thought he was acting in a good intention, by telling a teacher (who is also the mother), he breached the friend's trust. \n\nNext, the question is about whether the user was wrong. The key factors here are consent and trust. When someone shares personal information with you, it's generally expected to keep it confidential unless there's a legal obligation to report (like abuse or endangerment). The friend mentioned her own activities, not anything illegal or harmful. So, the user's action of snitching without a valid reason (like harm to others) might be seen as violating that trust. \n\nAlso, considering the impact: the friend is now upset and cutting him off. The user might have thought he was helping, but the method was inappropriate. Even if the mother might be concerned, it's not the user's place to share that information unless the friend explicitly allowed it or there was a risk involved. \n\nSo, the user likely did something wrong by sharing private details without consent, even if his motive was concern. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
