At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author did the right thing by telling the friend's mom about her sexual activities. \n\nFirst, the friend is 15, same as the author. She's sharing explicit details about her sex life, including losing her virginity at 13. The author decides to inform the mom because he thinks the mom should know. The friend is now upset and cut off contact.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend is a minor, so her parents might have a right to know about things that could affect her well-being. But the author is also a minor, so maybe the situation is complicated. The author didn't approach the friend first to talk about it, but instead went straight to the mom. That could be seen as violating trust. Friends often share personal things expecting confidentiality. If the author broke that trust without a good reason, that's a problem.\n\nBut the author's reasoning was concern for the friend's well-being, thinking from the mom's perspective. However, the appropriate action usually is to talk to the friend first, maybe express concerns, or if there's a real danger, involve an adult. But since the friend is 15, the parents might have a right to be informed about her activities, especially if they involve underage sex, which could be illegal or against school policies. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't seek advice or try to mediate. Just went to the mom with all the details. That could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The friend might feel that her private information was shared without her consent, which is a big deal in a friendship. \n\nSo the ethical dilemma here is between confidentiality and the parent's right to know. The author's action might be seen as necessary for the friend's protection, but the method was flawed. Maybe he should have talked to the friend first, or involved a trusted adult to mediate. But as a 15-year-old, he might not have that perspective. \n\nIn most cases, sharing a friend's private info without their consent is considered a breach of trust, even if the intention is good. So the author's action is likely to be seen as wrong because he didn't handle it in a way that respected the friend's privacy and trust. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
