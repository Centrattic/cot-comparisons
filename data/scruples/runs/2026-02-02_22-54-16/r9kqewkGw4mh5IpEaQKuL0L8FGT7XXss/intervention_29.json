At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote theAITA post is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation is that the friend, who's 15, was talking in explicit detail about sleeping around. The author, also 15, told the mom (who's their teacher) about it, leading to the friend being upset and cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, minors have certain rights, but when it comes to sharing personal information about someone else, especially a friend, there can be issues. The author is 15, so a minor themselves. The friend mentioned losing her virginity at 13, which in some places might be under the age of consent. But the age of consent varies by jurisdiction, and without knowing where they are, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality and the duty of a teacher. The mom is also a teacher, so maybe she has a responsibility to know if there's any illegal activity or if minors are engaging in activities that are against school policies. However, the author isn't the teacher; they're a peer. So by snitching, the author is breaking their friend's trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, they didn't have the authority to share that information.\n\nAlso, the friend might have shared those details under the assumption of confidentiality. The author's action could be seen as betrayal. While the author's intention was to protect the friend's mother, the method of doing so without involving the friend first or any official channels might be problematic. Additionally, the author's age might affect their judgment, as they're still a teenager and might not fully understand the implications of their actions.\n\nSo, ethically, even if the author's motive was good, the action of disclosing personal information without consent could be considered a breach of trust. The friend's reaction is a consequence of that breach. Unless there was a legal obligation to report (like underage activity), the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but socially and ethically, it's more complex. \n\nIn many AITA discussions, the consensus often leans towards the person who broke trust being the asshole unless there's a clear legal duty. Since the author is a peer and not a parent or authority figure, their actions might be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
