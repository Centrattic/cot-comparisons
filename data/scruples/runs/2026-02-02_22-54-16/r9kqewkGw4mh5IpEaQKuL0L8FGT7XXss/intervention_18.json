At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who's talking about sleeping around, and the author, a 15-year-old guy, told her mom, who's also a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone under 18 is engaging in sexual activity, especially if they're at a young age like 13 for losing virginity, there might be legal implications. Reporting could be seen as a way to protect the minor, even if it's a friend. But there's also the issue of privacy and consent. The friend shared personal information, and the author didn't ask permission to share it. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author claims they thought about the mother's perspective. But was it their place to decide to inform the mother? Some might say that as a minor, the author isn't the parent and shouldn't make that decision. Others might argue it's about safety and responsibility. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is negative, which shows the impact of the action. The author lost a friend, which is a consequence. But if the mother was genuinely concerned and the information was necessary for her to know, some might say it was the right call. \n\nI should check if the laws in the area require reporting such activities. For example, in some regions, mandatory reporters include teachers and school staff, but friends aren't. However, if the author believed there was harm or underage activity, they might feel justified. \n\nBut the friend was 15, and the mother is a teacher. If the mother is a teacher and also a parent, maybe there's a conflict of interest there. The author's intention was to protect by informing the mother, but the method of sharing explicit details without consent might be problematic. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sharing such personal information without consent is generally frowned upon, regardless of the reason. Even if the intent was good, the action breached trust. \n\nSo weighing all these factors: legal considerations, ethical breach of trust, and social consequences. The author's action might be seen as crossing a line, even with good intentions. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the law doesn't require it and the friend's behavior isn't illegal, then the author's action could be seen as violating privacy. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
