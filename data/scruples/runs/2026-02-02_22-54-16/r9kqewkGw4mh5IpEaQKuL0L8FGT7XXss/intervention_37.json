At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl sharing explicit details about her sexual activities with a friend, who then tells her mom, who is also a teacher. The friend is now upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals involved. The girl mentioned losing her virginity at 13. In many places, 13 is below the age of consent, which raises legal concerns. If the friend's mother is a teacher, she has a duty to report any illegal activities, like underage sex, to protect the child and comply with the law. However, the friend in this case isn't the one who reported it; the author did. \n\nThe author, being 15, might not fully understand the legal implications. But the key issue here is confidentiality. The friend trusted the author with personal information, which the author then disclosed to a parent/teacher. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, sharing such private details without consent breaches trust. \n\nAdditionally, the friend's mother initially thought it was a joke but later believed the author. The friend is now estranged because of this. The author's action led to the friend's privacy being violated, which is a significant social and ethical issue. Even if the author's intention was to protect the friend's mother, the method of disclosure, especially the explicit details, could have been handled differently. \n\nIn many contexts, especially in schools, there are protocols for reporting such matters. The author might have thought they were helping, but without proper channels, it's considered a breach of trust. So, while the author might have had good intentions, the action of snitching without consulting proper authority or the friend's mother directly could be seen as wrong. \n\nTherefore, considering confidentiality, breach of trust, and the social dynamics involved, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
