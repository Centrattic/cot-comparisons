At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a friend's mom about her, well, sexual activities. The author is a 15-year-old boy who met a friend in class, and they bonded over common interests. The friend, also 15, started talking about her relationships and sleeping around. The author waited a month before deciding to tell her mom, who's also his teacher. The friend is now upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's friend was sharing explicit details about her personal life. The author decided to inform her mother, thinking from her mom's perspective. The friend's behavior might be concerning, especially since she lost her virginity at 13, which could be a red flag for some parents. But the author is a minor himself, and the friend is also a minor. \n\nNext, legal aspects. In many places, minors can't legally consent to sexual activity until a certain age, which might be around 16. If the friend was 13 when she lost her virginity, that could be a statutory rape issue. However, the author isn't reporting a crime but rather sharing information. But does he have a responsibility to report something if he's aware of potential legal issues? That's a tricky area. However, since he's a peer, maybe he doesn't have a legal obligation. \n\nEthically, the author is breaching trust. Friends share personal info expecting confidentiality. By telling the mother, he's violating that trust without the friend's consent. Even if he thought he was helping, he didn't consult the friend first or seek advice on how to handle it. \n\nAlso, the mother is a teacher, so maybe there's a conflict there. If the mother is a teacher, the author might have felt pressure to act, but he could have approached the situation differently, like talking to a school counselor instead of the mother directly. \n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable\u2014she's upset because her personal life was exposed. The author's actions led to the loss of their friendship, which is a significant consequence. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect the friend's well-being by informing the mother. But the method was flawed. Instead of directly reporting to the mother, he could have sought guidance from a trusted adult first. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is a minor, so his judgment might be influenced by his age and inexperience. But that doesn't excuse the breach of trust. The friend's autonomy is also a factor here. Even if her behavior is concerning, she has the right to privacy. \n\nSo, considering all these points: legal implications, ethical breach of trust, and the impact on the friendship, the author made a mistake. He should have handled it differently, perhaps by talking to a counselor or teacher first, rather than immediately informing the mother. Therefore, the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
