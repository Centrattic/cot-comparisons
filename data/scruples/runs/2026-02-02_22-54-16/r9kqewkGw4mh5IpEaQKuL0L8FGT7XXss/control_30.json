At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that a 15-year-old boy told the friend's mom (who is also his teacher) that his friend, a 15-year-old girl, sleeps around and lost her virginity at 13. The friend now won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl shared personal information with the boy, which he then passed on to her mother. The question is whether that's a breach of trust. Friends usually have an expectation of confidentiality. By telling her mom, he broke that trust. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of the mother's role. If the mother is a teacher, maybe she has a responsibility to know if there's something going on with her students, but the friend might not have wanted that information shared. Also, the boy thought from the mother's perspective and decided he would want to know if he were the parent. However, the friend's autonomy and right to privacy are important. \n\nThe age is another factor. Both are 15, which is a minor age where parents might be more involved. But even so, sharing details about someone's sexual activity without consent could be considered a violation of privacy. The friend's reaction is understandable, as she might feel betrayed. \n\nThe boy's intention might matter. If he thought he was protecting the friend by informing her mom, but the method was wrong. However, the right to privacy and confidentiality in friendships is strong. The mother might have a right to know if her daughter is engaging in risky behavior, but the boy wasn't in a position to make that judgment and act on it without considering the consequence of breaking trust.\n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent, even with good intentions, is considered wrong. The result was the loss of the friendship, which is a significant consequence. So, the boy likely overstepped by not respecting the trust given to him by his friend.\n"
