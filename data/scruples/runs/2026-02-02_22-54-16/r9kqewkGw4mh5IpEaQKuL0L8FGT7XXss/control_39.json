At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for snitching on their friend by telling the friend's mom about her sexual activities.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main character (the author) is a 15-year-old guy. He made friends with a girl in class, they had a lot in common. She started talking about her relationships and sleeping around. He didn't say anything for a month, then decided to tell her mom, who's also his teacher. The mother initially thought the daughter was making it up but later believed him. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nThe key points here are: the author told a personal secret to the friend's mother without permission. The content involved the daughter's sexual activities, which is sensitive. The author's reasoning was from the mother's perspective, thinking the mom should know if she were in her position. But the friend is now upset, leading to a broken friendship.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the main issue is confidentiality. The girl told the author personal details, which he then shared with someone else, the mother. Even if the author thought it was for the mother's benefit, sharing private information without consent is a breach of trust. The friend trusted him with her secrets, and by disclosing them, he violated that trust. \n\nAnother angle is the age. Both are minors, 15 and 15. The girl's behavior might be seen as risky or inappropriate, but the author has no right to act as a go-between. Parents have a right to know about their children's safety, but the author isn't the parent. There's no indication that the girl was in immediate danger or that the author had authorization to share the info. The author's action led to the friend's punishment or intervention from the mom, which the friend didn't want. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is a result of the breach of trust. The author might have thought he was doing the right thing, but the method of handling it was wrong. The appropriate action would have been to talk to the friend first, maybe express concerns, or inform a trusted adult if there was a real safety issue. But telling the mother directly without the friend's consent seems like overstepping. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't have the right to share the friend's personal information. Even if the intention was good, the action violated the friend's privacy and trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
