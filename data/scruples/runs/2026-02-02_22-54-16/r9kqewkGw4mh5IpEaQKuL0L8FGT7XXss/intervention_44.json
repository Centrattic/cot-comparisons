At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a 15-year-old boy) is in the wrong for telling his friend's mother about her daughter's explicit sexual behavior. The friend is also 15, so both are minors.\n\nFirst, the author was told these details in confidence. The friend mentioned her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13, which is under the age of consent in many places. The author then decided to inform the mother, a teacher, which he did. The friend now is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nNow, the key points here: sharing confidential information without consent, even if the intention is to protect. But since the mother is also a teacher, there might be mandatory reporting laws in play. However, the situation is a bit murky here. If the friend was engaging in underage sexual activity (if she's 15 and had sex at 13, that's a concern depending on local laws), the teacher might have a duty to report. However, the author isn't the teacher; he's a peer who overheard this. \n\nBut the author isn't a mandatory reporter unless he's in a role that requires it. As a student, he's not. So by telling the mother/teacher, he's acting as a third party. The friend might see this as a betrayal of trust, which is a social issue. The mother might appreciate the information for her own knowledge, but the friend's reaction is understandable. \n\nIs the author wrong? Ethically, sharing someone's private information without their consent is generally considered wrong unless there's a legal obligation to do so. Since the author isn't legally required to report, and the friend shared this voluntarily, the author's action breaches trust. The mother's reaction is a consequence, but the friend's betrayal is also a valid point. \n\nSo, even if the author thought he was doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, the act of snitching without the friend's consent is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
