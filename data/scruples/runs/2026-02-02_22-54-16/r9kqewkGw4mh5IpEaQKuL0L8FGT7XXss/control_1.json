At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his friend's mom about her explicit behavior. \n\nFirst, the friend, a 15-year-old girl, shared details about her sexual activities with the author. The author, also 15, decided to inform the mother, who is his teacher. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to him anymore.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. The author didn't ask the friend if he could share her private information. Even if the author thought it was for her own good, sharing such personal details without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the mother might have a right to know if there's something concerning about her daughter's behavior, but the author's role here is tricky. As a peer, he's not a legal guardian or a teacher. He might not be the appropriate person to intervene in this situation. \n\nThe friend's actions, while perhaps concerning, are her personal choices. The author's decision to snitch could have violated her privacy. The mother's reaction and the friend's fallout suggest that the author overstepped. \n\nSo, even if the author had good intentions, the act of sharing private information without consent makes him the asshole. The answer is A.\n"
