At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15, same age as the author. The key points here are confidentiality, trust, and the appropriateness of the action.\n\nFirst, the friend shared personal details with the author. By sharing that information, the friend likely expected it to stay between them. The author then went to the mother, a teacher, and revealed explicit details. Even if the author thought they were acting in the mother's interest, the friend's privacy was violated. Trust is crucial in friendships, and breaking that trust can lead to the friend feeling betrayed.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they wanted to inform the mother because they thought the mother would want to know. However, the friend is a minor, but she shared her experiences with the author voluntarily. The author didn't consult the friend to see if she wanted that information shared with her mom. The mother being a teacher adds a layer here\u2014maybe the teacher has a duty to report certain things, but sleeping around isn't necessarily something that requires a report unless there's something illegal. Since the friend is 15 and lost her virginity at 13, maybe there's an issue with underage sex, but the author isn't the authority to report that. The mother was already aware because the daughter told her. The author's action was bypassing the friend's consent to share her private information, which is a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is a result of the author's action. The friendship ended because of this. Even if the author had good intentions, the method was wrong. Friends shouldn't share each other's private matters without consent. So yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
