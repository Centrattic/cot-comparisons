At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15, same age as the author, and they became friends. The friend shared explicit details about her relationships and sleeping around. The author then told the friend's mom, who is also their teacher, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries of friendship and privacy. Friends often share personal information, but there's an unspoken trust that such details remain confidential unless there's a compelling reason to share them. The author's reasoning was that they thought the mother should know, putting themselves in the mother's shoes. But as a 15-year-old, the author might not fully grasp the implications of breaching someone's trust.\n\nNext, the question of authority. The mother is a teacher, so perhaps the author thought it was their responsibility. However, the teacher's role is to educate, not necessarily to police students' personal lives. Unless there was a clear harm or legal concern (like underage sex, which in some places can be a legal issue), the teacher might not have a duty to intervene here. The author's disclosure could be seen as a breach of confidentiality, even if their intent was to protect the friend's mother.\n\nLegal aspects: In many jurisdictions, sharing someone's private information without consent can be a privacy violation. At 15, the friend is a minor, but the author is also a minor. Depending on the location, there might be laws about reporting certain activities, but casual sex isn't typically a reportable issue unless there's coercion or underage activity (if the friend is under the age of consent for the activities mentioned). If the friend is 15 and had sex at 13, depending on the country, that could be a legal issue, but the author isn't in a position to make that judgment.\n\nIntent matters. The author's intent was to inform, thinking the mother should know. However, the method (explicit details) and the lack of discussing it with the friend first are problematic. Friends should address concerns directly with each other before involving others. The author's action undermined the trust, leading to the friendship's end.\n\nEthically, even if the author believed the mother should know, the way it was handled is questionable. There's a balance between concern for a friend's well-being and respecting their privacy. The author might have thought they were helping, but without consulting the friend or a trusted adult (like a school counselor or guidance counselor instead of the teacher-mother), their approach was flawed.\n\nPotential consequences: The friend now refuses to talk to the author, which is a direct result of the breach of trust. The mother's belief in the story could lead to punishment or emotional distress for the friend. The author might face repercussions if the school deems their actions inappropriate.\n\nIn summary, while the author had intentions of concern for the friend's mother, the act of snitching without a clear, justified reason (like legal issues) and without consulting a proper authority or the friend first, the author likely overstepped. The friend's privacy was violated, and the friendship was damaged. So, the answer is more likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
