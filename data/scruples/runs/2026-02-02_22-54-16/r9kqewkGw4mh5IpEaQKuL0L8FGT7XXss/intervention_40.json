At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, was talking to the author about her sexual activities, losing her virginity at 13, and sleeping around. The author then told the girl's mom, who is also their teacher, leading to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so losing virginity at 13 might be underage and illegal. If that's the case, the author might have a legal duty to report it, especially since the mom is a teacher with a duty to report child abuse or underage sexual activity. However, the author is also a minor, so their role here is tricky. \n\nEthically, the author was trying to protect the friend by informing the mother, thinking it's what a parent would want to know. But by sharing private details, maybe the author overstepped, even if with good intentions. The friend's right to privacy is important. Even if the author thought it was right, sharing explicit details without consent can damage trust and the friendship. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation matters. Were they acting out of genuine concern for the friend's well-being, or was there another reason, like jealousy or wanting to look good to the teacher? The story doesn't mention that, so it's hard to say. \n\nAnother angle: the mother was already a teacher and might be involved in the girl's life. Maybe the mother should have noticed signs of her daughter's behavior. But the author stepping in to report this could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the action was meant to help, it's possible the author didn't consider the girl's autonomy or the potential consequences of exposing her secrets. \n\nIn terms of social responsibility, minors might not fully understand the implications of their actions. The author is 15, so their judgment could be immature. The friend's reaction of cutting off contact suggests that the betrayal was significant. \n\nLegally, if the sexual activity is underage and non-consensual, the author might be right to report. But if it's consensual but underage, the author's role is still questionable. However, in many jurisdictions, teachers are mandated reporters, but the author isn't a teacher. The mother is a teacher, so maybe she should have been aware already. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for violating the friend's privacy, even if the intention was to protect. The key points are the legality of the situation, the breach of trust, and the impact on the friendship. Without clear legal obligation to report, sharing such personal information could be seen as a breach of confidentiality. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
