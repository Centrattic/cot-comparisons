At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that the author told the friend's mom about her sexual activities after hearing about them from the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both the author and the friend are 15 years old. The friend shared personal details, and the author decided to inform her mother, who's also a teacher. The friend is now upset and won't talk to the author anymore.\n\nSo, key points here: Privacy and consent. Did the author have the right to share someone else's private information? Even if the author thought it was for the friend's mother's knowledge, the friend might not have wanted that. Also, the age is a factor here. At 15, teens might not be in a position to make adult decisions, so maybe the mother's concern is valid. But the author's role as a friend and the breach of trust is a big issue.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they thought the mother would want to know. But friends aren't supposed to share each other's private info without permission. Even if the author had good intentions, breaking confidentiality in a friendship is a major transgression. The result is the friend cutting off contact, which is a consequence of the breach.\n\nAlso, considering the ethical angle, even if the author was worried about the friend's behavior, the proper approach might have been to talk to the friend's parents themselves, but still, sharing explicit details without consent is problematic. The mother might have a right to know if her child is engaging in risky behavior, but the method of disclosure here was through the friend rather than the parent directly. However, the author isn't the parent, so overstepping here by becoming a \"snitch\" is an issue.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the author's action caused harm to the friendship and violated trust. Even if the author's intent was protective, the means were wrong. So the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they broke the friend's trust without a valid reason or consent.\n"
