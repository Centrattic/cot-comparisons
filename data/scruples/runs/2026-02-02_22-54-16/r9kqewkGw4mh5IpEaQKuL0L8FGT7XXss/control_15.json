At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is 15, and the author is also 15. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was sharing personal details about her relationships and losing her virginity at 13. The author felt that if they were in the mother's position, they would want to know. So they told the mother, who is also their teacher.\n\nNow, thinking about privacy and consent. Just because someone shares personal information doesn't mean they want it relayed to their parents, especially if it's something sensitive. The author might have believed they were protecting their friend, but they didn't consider the friend's right to privacy. \n\nNext, the age factor. Both are 15, which is a minor age. The friend is engaging in behavior that's risky, like losing virginity at 13 and sleeping around. The mother might have a right to be informed if her child is in potential harm, but the author didn't approach it by talking to the friend or a trusted adult first. \n\nAlso, the friendship was ruined because of this. The friend is upset and refuses to talk, which shows that the action had negative consequences. The author's intent was to inform the mother, but the method was a betrayal of trust. \n\nIn most cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent is a breach of trust, even if the intent is good. Unless there's a legal obligation like abuse or danger, the author overstepped by using the information the friend shared in confidence. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
