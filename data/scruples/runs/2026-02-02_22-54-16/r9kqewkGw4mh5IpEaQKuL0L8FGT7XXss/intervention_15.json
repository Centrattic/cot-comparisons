At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a 15-year-old boy who told his friend's mom about her daughter's sexual activities. The friend confided in him, and he felt like the mom should know. The friend is now upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend shared personal details about her sex life and relationships. The author, being a peer, might not be in a position to make decisions about whether that information should be shared with a parent. But why did he decide to tell the mom? He mentioned he thought from the mom's perspective and wanted to inform her. But the friend was 15, so she's a minor. In many places, parents are legally responsible for their children's actions, so maybe the author thought it was his duty to inform the parent. However, was that the right approach?\n\nConfidentiality vs. the parent's right to know. When someone shares personal information, especially with a friend, they expect it to stay private. The author might have broken that trust. Even if the parent is the one who needs to know, the friend might have had the right to decide when or if to tell her mom. The author didn't consult the friend or the parent directly; he just took it upon himself to act. That could be seen as overstepping his role.\n\nAlso, the way he told the mom\u2014explicit details about her daughter's sex life. That could have been very intrusive. The mom might have preferred to approach her daughter directly and handle it privately. By giving the mom such explicit info, the author might have caused unnecessary harm, like damaging the friend's reputation or trust within her family.\n\nAnother angle: the friend might not have wanted the mom to know. She might have felt comfortable sharing with a friend but not with her parent. The author's action could have led to the friend feeling betrayed, which is why she cut off contact. The author might not have considered the consequences on their friendship and the friend's autonomy in deciding what to share.\n\nBut then again, the author was trying to help. He thought the mom should know because maybe she wasn't aware of her daughter's behavior. However, the friend might have been in a situation where she didn't want to be lectured or reprimanded. The line between helping and meddling is thin here.\n\nLegally, maybe the parent has a right to know, but ethically, the author didn't have the authority to decide what the parent should be told about their child. The friend might have been in a position to make that decision herself. So, the author's action, while maybe well-intentioned, crossed a boundary by sharing private information without consent.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author thought he was doing the right thing by informing the parent, he violated the friend's trust. The friend's privacy and autonomy in sharing her own information with her parent should have been respected. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
