At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend told explicit details about sleeping around, and the author told her mom, who's also a teacher. Now the friend is upset and not talking to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to share that information. The friend told the author in confidence, so maybe there's a breach of trust here. But then, the author thought about the mother's perspective and decided to inform her. However, the friend is a minor (15 years old), and the mother is a teacher, which might be in a position to act on such information.\n\nBut wait, even if the teacher is the mother, how did the author get permission to share personal details? The friend might have considered the conversation private. The author didn't check with the friend first, just went straight to the mom. That seems like a violation of trust. Even if the author thought it was for the friend's own good or the mom's, they didn't own the information to share. \n\nAlso, the friend is 15, and the author is 15 as well. They might not fully understand the consequences of sharing such private matters. The act of snitching could be seen as crossing a personal boundary. The friend's actions, while perhaps not ideal, are her personal life. Unless there's a legal or safety concern (like underage sex, but the friend lost virginity at 13 which might be under age), but the author didn't mention reporting to authorities, just told the mom. However, if the mom is a teacher, she might have duties to report certain things, but the author isn't a mandated reporter. \n\nSo, in terms of trust and friendship, the author definitely acted wrong by sharing private info without consent. Even if the intention was to protect the friend's mom, the method was wrong. The friend's privacy was violated. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
