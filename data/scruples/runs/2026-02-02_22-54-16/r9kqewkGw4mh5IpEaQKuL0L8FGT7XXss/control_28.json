At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is 15 and told their friend's mom about her sexual activities because they thought the mom should know. The friend is also 15, and the mom is their teacher. The friend is upset and no longer talks to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and privacy. When someone shares personal details, especially about their private life, it's generally expected that those details stay between them and the person they're telling. The user shared explicit information without the friend's consent. Even if they thought it was for the friend's own good or for the mom to know, it's a violation of trust. \n\nThen there's the age factor. Both are minors, and their parents have a role in their lives, but does that justify snitching? The friend's mom is their teacher, so there's a power dynamic here. The user might have felt conflicted, thinking they were doing the right thing by informing a parent/teacher. But the friend's reaction is clear\u2014they feel betrayed. \n\nEthically, sharing someone's private information without their permission is usually wrong, even if the intent is good. The user didn't approach the mom in a way that might have given the friend a chance to address it herself, like maybe talking to the friend first about their behavior. Instead, they went directly to the mom with explicit details, which could have led to the friend losing her privacy and facing consequences. \n\nAlso, the friend's actions might be considered risky for a 15-year-old, but the user's role isn't to act as a parent or authority figure. The appropriate action would have been to talk to the friend about their concerns or perhaps a trusted adult, but not to breach confidentiality. \n\nIn terms of the fallout, the friendship ended because of this betrayal. While the friend might have made poor choices, the user's method of handling it destroyed the trust. The question is if the user's action was justified. Most likely, the answer is A because the user violated trust and privacy without a clear, direct harm to others that required intervention. The friend's mom might have a right to know if there was explicit underage activity or if someone was being harmed, but based on the story, it's about the friend's behavior, not third-party harm. So the user overstepped by sharing without consent.\n"
