At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that a 15-year-old boy told his friend's mom (who is also his teacher) that his friend sleeps around and lost her virginity at 13. The friend is now upset and won't talk to him.\n\nSo, first, the key points here are about privacy and consent. The friend shared personal details with the author, trusting him. By sharing that information with her mom, the author broke that trust. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing for the mom to know, without the friend's consent, it's a breach of privacy. \n\nAt 15, both kids are minors, and their actions might be seen as part of their exploration, but the act of sharing someone else's private information without permission is generally considered wrong. The mom's reaction and the friend's anger indicate that the author overstepped. \n\nAlso, the author didn't mention discussing this with the friend first to understand her situation or get her consent. He acted based on his own judgment of what the mom should know. Even if the mother is a teacher, the information was confidential between the two students. \n\nSo, even if the intention was to help, the method was wrong. The author violated his friend's trust, leading to the loss of their friendship. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
