At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a 15-year-old guy who met a girl in class. They have a lot in common and became friends. The girl started talking about her previous relationships and how she likes sleeping around. The friend didn't care at first but then thought about how the girl's mom would feel. So he told the mom (who is also a teacher) all the details, including that the girl lost her virginity at 13. Now the friend is upset and they're not talking anymore. The question is whether the author is the asshole for snitching.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The girl shared personal information with the author. The author kept it a secret for a month but then decided to tell the mom. The mom initially didn't believe but later did. The friend is now angry and they're no longer friends.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, minors can't consent to sharing other minors' private information without permission. But since they're both 15, maybe there's a different angle. The mom is also a teacher, which might involve mandatory reporting laws, but the author isn't a mandatory reporter. However, the mom might have been concerned about her daughter's safety or well-being.\n\nEthically, the author took it upon himself to act on what he felt was right, considering the mom's perspective. But he didn't consult the girl or get her permission to share her secrets. Trust is a big part of friendships, and breaking that trust can damage the relationship. The girl's privacy was violated, even if the author's intentions were to protect her. However, if the girl's behavior was risky or harmful, the author might have thought he was helping. But without knowing if there was actual harm, it's hard to say. The age of consent is a factor here; losing virginity at 13 in some places is legal, but depending on the region, it could be a gray area. However, the author's mom might not be involved in that aspect unless there were legal issues.\n\nThe author's actions caused a rift in the friendship. The friend's reaction is understandable because confidentiality was broken. The author didn't seek advice from adults, like a teacher or counselor, but instead went straight to the mom. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the girl about his concerns first or involve a trusted adult who could mediate without exposing the girl's private details.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for breaching confidentiality and causing harm to the friendship without clear justification of harm. However, if there was a genuine concern about the girl's well-being, maybe he had good intentions. But the method was problematic. The answer is likely A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
