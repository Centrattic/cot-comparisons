At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend's mom about her sleeping around. The friend is 15, and the author is also 15.\n\nFirst, the friend shared personal details about her relationships and sexual activity. The friend mentioned losing her virginity at 13 and sleeping around. The author then told the mother, which led to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nNow, considering the situation: the friend shared this information with the author, possibly in confidence. The author didn't see it as a problem at first but later decided to inform the mother. The mother is also a teacher, which might add a layer of authority or responsibility.\n\nOn one hand, the author might think they're looking out for the friend's well-being, considering the mother's perspective. But on the other hand, the friend trusted the author with private information, and the author broke that trust. Even if the author was concerned, sharing such explicit details without consent could be seen as a betrayal. The friend's reaction is a consequence of this breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the age of the individuals is 15, which might mean they're still navigating what is appropriate to share and how to handle peer situations. The author's action disrupted their friendship, and the friend now refuses to talk to them. The question is whether the author overstepped by snitching.\n\nFrom a trust standpoint, sharing confidential information given in confidence is generally considered wrong, unless there's a legal obligation or imminent harm. Here, the author didn't mention any immediate danger, just concern from the mother's perspective. So the act of sharing without consent likely violated the trust, making the author at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
