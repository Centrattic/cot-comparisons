At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the scenario: A 15-year-old boy confided in his friend (also 15) about her sexual activity and relationships. The friend then told the mother/teacher about these details, leading to a fallout. The question is whether the author (the one who told) is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The friend shared personal information with the author, trusting him. The author then went to the mother, a teacher, and revealed explicit details. The friend now refuses to talk to the author.\n\nFrom a confidentiality standpoint, when someone shares personal information, especially in a friendship, there's an expectation of privacy. The author broke that trust by disclosing the information to someone else, even if he had the mother's perspective in mind. However, the mother is also a teacher, so there might be a duty to report if there's something concerning, like underage sexual activity. But in this case, the friend is 15, so 13 when she lost her virginity. In many places, consensual sex at 13 might be a legal issue if there's a significant age difference, but the scenario doesn't mention that.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that he thought the mother should know. But the friend's actions, while perhaps risky, are her personal choices. The author didn't seek to protect her from immediate harm; instead, he acted on his own judgment about what the mother should know. That could be seen as violating the friend's privacy and trust without a clear legal or safety imperative.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is a teacher and might have a responsibility to know if a student is in a problematic situation. But the author didn't approach it through the proper channels, like talking to the teacher without disclosing the friend's private information. Instead, he told explicit details that the friend shared in confidence.\n\nSo, the main issue is the breach of trust. Even if the author had good intentions, sharing personal, explicit details without the friend's consent is a violation of privacy. The friend's actions, while potentially concerning, don't necessarily justify the author's disclosure unless there's a legal obligation or imminent harm, which isn't detailed here.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong for breaking confidentiality without a valid reason. The answer should be A.\n"
