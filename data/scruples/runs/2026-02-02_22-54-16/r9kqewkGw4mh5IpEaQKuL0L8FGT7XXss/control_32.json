At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person (a 15-year-old boy) became friends with a girl who shared detailed information about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. He didn't say anything for a month, then decided to tell her mom, who is also his teacher. The mom initially thought the daughter was making things up but later believed the son. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is privacy. The girl confided in him, and he didn't keep that confidential. Even if he thought he was acting in the mother's interest, sharing such personal details without consent is a breach of trust. The question is whether this makes him the asshole.\n\nLegally and ethically, sharing someone's private information without their permission is generally wrong. But there are exceptions, like if there's a risk of harm. The mother might have a right to know if her daughter is in a dangerous situation. However, the girl mentioned sleeping around and relationships, which might not necessarily be illegal or harmful. The age of consent varies, but if she's 15 and lost her virginity at 13, that could be a legal issue in some places. Wait, the girl is 15 in the story, right? Wait, the friend is 15f (female). If she lost her virginity at 13, that's when she was 13. Depending on the jurisdiction, that could be statutory rape, which is illegal. But the person who told the mother might not be the one to report that. Instead, the mother should handle it. But if the friend is a minor (15), he might not be in a position to judge or report legally. So maybe he overstepped. \n\nBut the main ethical point is about trust. The girl shared personal info with the friend, trusting him. By telling the mother, he broke that trust. Even if his intentions were good, the action was a violation of confidentiality. Unless there was immediate danger, which isn't specified here, he's probably in the wrong. Also, the mother was already aware of the daughter's previous relationships through the son's report, but the daughter's privacy was compromised. The mother might have a right to know, but the friend didn't have the right to be the one to inform her. The daughter's reaction is understandable; trust is broken. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
