At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 15-year-old guy, had a friend (also 15, a girl) who told him she sleeps around a lot and shared explicit details about her relationships. After a month, he decided to tell her mom, who is also his teacher, everything. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him, and the author is wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of trust. When friends share personal information, especially sensitive stuff like their sex life, there's an expectation that it's confidential. The author kept quiet for a month, which might be why the friend trusted him. Then he went to her mom, so that's a breach of confidentiality. \n\nNext, the age factor. Both are 15, which in many places is a minor. Parents are typically responsible for their children's well-being. If the friend was engaging in risky behavior, like losing her virginity at 13, the mom might not know and could need to be informed. But the question is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that he tried to see it from the mom's perspective and thought he would want to know. However, as a friend, he's not in the position of a parent. There's a difference between parental concern and a friend's overstepping. The friend might have shared those details in confidence, expecting it not to be revealed to her parents.\n\nAlso, the friend reacted poorly, which makes sense because her personal life was exposed without her consent. The author didn't discuss it with her directly first, which might have been a better approach. If he was worried, he could have talked to her about the concerns instead of going straight to her mom. \n\nThe role of the teacher here is important. The mom is a teacher, so maybe there's a conflict of interest. But the main issue is the breach of trust between friends. Even if the author thought it was for the friend's own good, the act of snitching without her consent is problematic. \n\nIn some cases, if there's a legal or safety concern, like underage sex or potential harm, a teacher or parent might need to be informed. However, the author is not an authority figure; he's a peer. Unless there was an immediate risk, like the friend was in danger or others were being harmed, the author's action might be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe friend's actions (sleeping around) are her personal choice, and while the author might disapprove, sharing that with her mom without her consent is an invasion of privacy. The friend might have wanted to discuss things with her mom herself, or maybe not. The author decided for her, which is a problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author broke a trust by sharing private information without the friend's consent. Even if the intention was to help, the method was wrong. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
