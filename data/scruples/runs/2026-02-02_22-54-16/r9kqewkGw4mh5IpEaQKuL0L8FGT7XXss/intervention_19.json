At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 15-year-old who became friends with another girl in their class. They bonded over shared interests and started talking a lot. The friend began sharing details about her sexual activities, including sleeping around, having a friends-with-benefits arrangement, and losing her virginity at 13. The author kept this information to themselves for a month, then decided to tell the friend's mother, who is also their teacher. The mother initially thought the daughter was lying but later believed the author. The friend is now upset and won't talk to the author anymore. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for snitching.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The friend shared personal and sensitive information with the author. The author chose to share this with the mother, which led to the friend being upset. So, the main issue here is the breach of confidentiality between friends.\n\nAt 15 years old, the author is a minor, but that might not affect the moral judgment here. The key factors are: 1) Did the author have the right to share the information? 2) Was there a valid reason to do so? 3) What were the consequences?\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they tried to see it from the mother's perspective and wanted to inform her as a concerned friend. However, the problem is that the information shared by the friend was private. Even if the author thought the mother had a right to know, the friend had a reasonable expectation of privacy in her conversations with a peer. By sharing this, the author violated that trust.\n\nIn most social circles, friends are expected to keep each other's secrets unless there's a serious risk of harm (like illegal activity, abuse, etc.). Here, the situation is about the friend's sexual behavior. While some might argue that the mother has a right to know, the author didn't seek to discuss it with the friend or involve an authority in a way that respects the friend's autonomy. Instead, the author went directly to the mother with explicit details, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust.\n\nThe result is that the friend is now upset and has cut off communication. That's a significant consequence of the author's actions. Even if the author's intention was to protect the friend's well-being, the method used was inappropriate. The right approach might have been to talk to the friend first, express concerns, or seek guidance from a trusted adult (like a teacher or counselor) without exposing the friend's private information.\n\nAlso, the author's role as a peer might not make them the appropriate person to disclose such information to a parent. Unless there's a legal obligation (like in cases of abuse, which isn't mentioned here), sharing private details without consent is generally considered a breach of confidentiality.\n\nSo, considering all these points: the violation of trust, the method of disclosure, and the resulting harm to the friendship, it seems that the author is in the wrong. Answering A (Yes) would indicate that the author is in the wrong, which aligns with the analysis.\n"
