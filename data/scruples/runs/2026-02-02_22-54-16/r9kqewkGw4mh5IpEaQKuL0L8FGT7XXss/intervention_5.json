At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 15 years old, and their friend (also 15) was talking a lot about sleeping around, including losing her virginity at 13. The author felt that from the mother's perspective, this information was important, so they told the mom (who is also their teacher) in explicit detail. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to them. The question is whether the author did the right thing by reporting this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is around 16 or 18, so if the friend lost her virginity at 13, that might be a problem. If there's a significant age difference or if the friend was under 13, that could be statutory rape, which is a crime. However, if she was 13 and the partner was over 18, that's definitely illegal. If both were 13, maybe not, depending on the location. But the author didn't mention the partner's age, so that's unclear.\n\nThe author's reasoning was from the mother's perspective, thinking she should know. However, sharing someone's private information without their consent is a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, the action of snitching without considering the consequences is questionable. The friend might feel betrayed, especially since they were sharing personal stories. The author might have thought they were protecting the friend or her family, but the method was invasive.\n\nAlso, the author told the mother, who is a teacher. Teachers have a duty to report certain things, like abuse or illegal activities. If the author told the teacher, maybe the teacher should take action, but the author's role in that is still questionable. The friend's privacy is important, and even if the author thought it was right, they might have overstepped.\n\nAnother angle: the friend was sharing these details voluntarily with the author. The author didn't ask for that info, but chose to share it with the mother. The friend might have expected confidentiality. Unless there's a legal obligation (like reporting abuse), the author isn't supposed to share that. So, even if the friend's behavior is risky, the author's action of breaching trust is wrong.\n\nBut some might argue that the author was acting in good faith, trying to help. However, the consequences were that the friend lost trust and they're no longer friends. The author didn't seek advice from a parent or professional before acting, which might have been a better approach. So, while the intent might be good, the action was inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author likely did something wrong by sharing private information without consent, even if the intention was to help. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
