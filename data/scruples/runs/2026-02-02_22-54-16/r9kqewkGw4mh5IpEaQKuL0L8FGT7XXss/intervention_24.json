At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The author is a 15-year-old boy who became friends with a girl (also 15) in class. They bonded over shared interests, and she started talking a lot about her sexual experiences, including losing her virginity at 13. The author decided to tell the girl's mom, who is also his teacher, about these details. The mom initially thought her daughter was making it up but later believed the author. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, children have certain rights to privacy, but there are also laws about child welfare. If the girl is under 18 and engaging in sexual activity, especially if there's a possibility of underage consent issues (like if she was 13, depending on the jurisdiction), there might be a legal duty to report. However, the author is also a minor, so maybe the legal responsibility isn't on him. \n\nEthically, the author's intent matters. He says he considered his friend's mother's perspective and wanted to protect her. But he didn't talk to the girl first or get her consent. Telling the mother without the girl's knowledge could be seen as violating trust. Friends usually expect confidentiality unless there's a serious issue. \n\nThe mother's role: since she's also a teacher, there might be school policies about reporting. If the teacher (mom) didn't know about her daughter's activities, the author's disclosure might be considered a breach of privacy. However, if the teacher has a duty to report or intervene, maybe the author thought he was helping. But since the author is a peer, maybe he shouldn't be the one to report unless there's immediate danger.\n\nAnother angle: the girl might not want her mom to know, and the author disclosing without asking could harm their friendship. The friend's reaction is to cut off contact, which makes sense if she felt betrayed. The author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, led to a broken trust.\n\nIn terms of whether it's in the wrong, the author's action was to inform the mother out of concern. But the method (without the friend's knowledge) might be problematic. Even if the mother is a parent, the daughter might have a right to privacy. The author didn't consult the friend first or seek advice from an adult. Maybe he should have spoken to a trusted adult before taking action.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action could be seen as crossing a boundary by sharing personal information without consent, even if the motive was to protect. The ethical judgment here is tricky, but the act of snitching on a friend's private matters to a parent could be seen as wrong because it breaches trust. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
