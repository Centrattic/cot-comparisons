At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The friend was talking about sleeping around, and the author told her mom, who is also their teacher. The friend is now upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age here. Both the author and the friend are 15. In many places, people under 16 aren't legally adults, so their parents do have some responsibility to be aware of their activities. But the author went to the mother directly with explicit details, which might be seen as a breach of the friend's privacy.\n\nThe friend shared personal information with the author, trusting them. By telling the mother, the author broke that trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, the action of snitching without the friend's consent can damage the friendship. The friend's reaction is understandable\u2014being betrayed like that would hurt.\n\nBut the author's reasoning was that they considered the mother's perspective and wanted to protect the friend. However, even with good intentions, sharing someone's private information without their consent is usually a problem. The mother might not have been aware, but the author didn't try to address the situation with the friend first. Maybe they could have talked to the friend about their concerns instead of going straight to the mom.\n\nAlso, the friend mentioned losing her virginity at 13. Depending on the laws in their area, this could be a legal issue. If the friend is 15 and had sex at 13, that might be statutory rape, which is a crime. In that case, the author might have a legal obligation to report it. But the question is about moral or social wrong, not legal. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong socially.\n\nSo, even if there's a legal aspect, the social aspect is about trust and privacy. The author's action led to the friend cutting off contact, which is a consequence. The author didn't own the information and shared it without permission. Even if the motive was to protect, the method was a violation of trust. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong. They should have handled it differently, maybe by talking to the friend first or seeking advice before taking action.\n"
