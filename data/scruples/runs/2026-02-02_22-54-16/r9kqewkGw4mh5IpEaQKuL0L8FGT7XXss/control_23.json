At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 15-year-old girl told her friend (the author) in detail about her sexual experiences, including losing her virginity at 13. The author then decided to tell her mom, who's also a teacher, all those details. Now the friend is upset and doesn't talk to the author anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially about sensitive topics like sex, it's usually trusted to be kept private. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by protecting the girl's well-being, but sharing explicit details with her mom seems like a breach of trust. Even if the author felt it was the right thing from their perspective, the friend didn't consent to her private information being shared with her mother. \n\nAlso, the friend's mother might not have been aware, but the mom is also the friend's teacher. There's a power dynamic here where the teacher could be in a position to take disciplinary action or make the situation uncomfortable for the student. The author might have crossed a line by involving the mother, especially if the friend didn't want that. \n\nAnother angle is the age of the individuals. At 15, they're teenagers, and their relationships and decisions might be seen as part of their personal development. However, engaging in sexual activity at 13 could be a concern depending on local laws and the mother's awareness. The author might have intended to help by informing the mother, but without the friend's consent, it's still a violation of privacy. \n\nThe friend's reaction is also a factor. She was upset and stopped talking to the author, which indicates that the action had a negative impact on their friendship. The author should have considered the consequences of sharing such information and whether it was their place to do so. \n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private information without their permission is considered a breach of trust, even if the intention was good. The mother might have the right to know about her daughter's safety, but the author didn't ask if the mother was okay with this information being shared. It's possible that the mother might have a different approach to handling her daughter's behavior, and the author's action might have overstepped. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because they shared confidential information without consent, leading to a broken friendship. Even if the intention was to protect, the method used was inappropriate. The answer is A.\n"
