At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a 15-year-old boy who started a friendship with a girl in his class. They had a lot in common and talked about various things. The girl mentioned in explicit detail that she sleeps around a lot, including losing her virginity at 13 and having a FWB (friends with benefits) and trying to get with her BFF who's a guy. The user decided to tell her mom, who is also his teacher, after considering her mom's perspective. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him, and he's asking if he's the asshole for snitching.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The key points here are privacy, consent, and the appropriateness of the action. The friend shared personal information with the user, which is common in close friendships, but the user then decided to share that information with her mom. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nThe user's reasoning was that if he were in his mom's position, he'd want to know. But does that mean he had the right to act as a go-between? Just because someone is close to a friend doesn't mean they can disclose personal details without the friend's consent. The girl might have shared that info under the assumption that it's private between them, not knowing the user would tell her mom. \n\nAlso, the user is 15, so both he and the friend are minors. The mother might have a right to be concerned about her daughter's behavior, but the method of finding out is problematic. The user's action was a breach of trust, even if his intentions were to protect or inform the mother. Friends should be able to trust each other with personal matters. \n\nFurthermore, the user didn't approach the girl to discuss this first or maybe alert the mother through an official channel, like a school counselor, instead of using a personal relationship. The fact that the mother is also a teacher might add complexity. If the user was worried about the girl's actions being inappropriate for a student, he should have approached the school's reporting system rather than personal disclosure. \n\nThere's also the question of whether the user had the authority or responsibility to do so. As a peer, he's not in a position to make decisions about another student's privacy. The girl's personal life, while concerning to some, is her own business unless there's a clear violation of rules or harm involved. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's action was a violation of his friend's privacy, done without consent, and likely caused harm to their friendship. Even if his intentions were good, the lack of consent and the method of disclosure make him the asshole. The answer should be A.\n"
