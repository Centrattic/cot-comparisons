At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they told their friend's mom about her sexual activities because they thought the mom should know. The friend is 15, and the mom is also a teacher. The friend mentioned losing her virginity at 13 and sleeping around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of consent in their area. If the friend lost her virginity at 13, and the legal age of consent is higher than that, then there might be a legal issue. But if 13 is the legal age where they are\u2014like in some places\u2014it might not be illegal. However, if the friend was under 13, that's a different story. The user didn't specify the age of the friend she had sex with, so that's a bit unclear. \n\nNext, the author's motivation. They say they thought about it from the mom's perspective and wanted to protect her. But sharing someone's private information without permission is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, the action of snitching without the friend's consent could be seen as violating her privacy. \n\nAlso, the friend might have shared those details with the author in confidence, expecting it to stay between them. By telling the mom, the author broke that trust. The friend's reaction is understandable\u2014she's upset and now avoids the author. \n\nAnother angle: the author is the same age as the friend. Maybe they don't have the authority or experience to judge what's appropriate. The mom is a teacher, so perhaps the author thought they had a responsibility, but usually, teachers are responsible for reporting, not peers. \n\nHowever, if the friend was engaging in illegal activities (like under the age of consent), the author might feel they had a duty to inform the mom. But again, without knowing the exact ages involved, it's hard to say. The author mentions the friend is 15, but the age when she lost her virginity is 13. If that's under the legal age, then it's a different matter. But if it's legal, then the author's action might be seen as overstepping.\n\nSo, the key points are: breaking trust, privacy violation, and whether there's a legal aspect. Even if the author's intention was to protect the mom, the method was problematic. Most people would argue that sharing such personal info without consent is wrong, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
