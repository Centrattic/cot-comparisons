At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for tattling on their friend to her mom. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is a 15-year-old guy who befriended another girl in class. They bonded over shared interests, and she started sharing personal details about her relationships and casual sex. The user didn't mind at first but later thought about how the girl's mom would feel if she knew. So he told the mom, who is also his teacher, all the explicit details, including that the girl lost her virginity at 13. Now, the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. Friends often share personal stuff with the expectation that it's private. By telling the mom, the user broke that trust. But why did he do it? He thought the mom should know for her own good. That's a common argument in these situations\u2014acting in someone else's best interest. However, is that a valid reason to breach confidentiality?\n\nNext, the age factor. The girl is 15, which is a minor in most places, but she's making her own choices. Did the user have a responsibility to inform the mom? Maybe, but it's complicated. Parents often want to know if their child is engaging in risky behavior, but the line between parental rights and a child's autonomy is tricky. Also, the user isn't a parent, so maybe that's not his decision to make.\n\nThe user's actions led to the friend cutting him off. That's a consequence he has to live with. But was he wrong? Trust is a big part of friendship. If you share something personal and someone else tells a parent without consent, that's a betrayal. Even if the intent was good, the method might be wrong.\n\nAnother angle: is the user responsible for her actions? She was the one sharing the information. If she didn't want her mom to know, maybe she shouldn't have shared it. But that's a harsh stance. People might share things in confidence expecting discretion. The user might have overstepped by sharing without checking if that was okay.\n\nAlso, the user told the teacher/mom in explicit detail, including the age of losing virginity. That feels like sharing more than necessary. Maybe he could have talked to the mom privately first instead of giving all the explicit info?\n\nLegally, in some places, reporting underage sex might be required if there's a suspicion of abuse or illegal activity. If the girl was under 13, it's different, but she was 15. However, the user is 15 too, so maybe there's no legal obligation unless there's something else. But the user's action isn't about legal reporting but personal judgment.\n\nSo, the main points are trust violation, the intent to help vs. the action of snitching, and the consequences. The user likely overstepped by sharing private info without consent, even if he thought it was right. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
