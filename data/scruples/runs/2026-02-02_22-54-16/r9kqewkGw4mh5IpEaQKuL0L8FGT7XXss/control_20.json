At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old who confided in a friend about their sexual activities and past relationships. The friend, considering the mother's perspective, decides to inform the mother, leading to a fallout. The question is whether the friend was wrong for snitching.\n\nFirst, the friend shared a lot about their personal life, including losing virginity at 13. The user thought about the mother's point of view and felt compelled to report this. But was it right to do so without the friend's consent?\n\nPrivacy is a big factor here. Even if the friend talked openly, sharing that info with the mother without permission breaches trust. The friend might have expected confidentiality. The user might have thought they were acting in the mother's interest, but they didn't consult the friend or the mother first. \n\nAlso, the friend's actions led to the mother believing the daughter was lying initially but then believing the user. The friend now refuses to talk to the user, showing the consequence of the action. \n\nAt 15, the user might not fully grasp the implications of violating someone's privacy. Even if the user thought they were doing the right thing, the method was wrong. The friend's right to privacy and trust should take precedence unless there's immediate harm, which isn't clear here. \n\nSo, even with good intentions, the user broke trust and invaded privacy. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
