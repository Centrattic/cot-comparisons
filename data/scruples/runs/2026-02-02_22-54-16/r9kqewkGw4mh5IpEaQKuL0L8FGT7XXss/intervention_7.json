At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by telling the friend's mom about her sexual activity. The friend is 15, same as the author. The friend shared a lot of personal stuff, including losing her virginity at 13 and being with FWB and trying to get her BFF. The author decided to inform the mom, who's also a teacher, because he thought the mom would want to know.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether it's appropriate for a 15-year-old to share such personal information and then for the other 15-year-old to disclose it to a parent. The friend might have shared the info in confidence, so the author broke that trust. Even though the author might have thought it was for the friend's own good or the mom's right to know, the act of snitching without the friend's consent breaches trust. \n\nBut minors might not have the same expectations of privacy as adults. In some contexts, parents have a duty to know about their children's well-being, especially regarding risky behaviors. However, the author is a peer, not a parent. The teacher being the mom complicates things because the teacher might have a responsibility to report or intervene if there's a safety concern. But the author isn't the teacher; he's a student. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The friend shared personal info with the author, trusting him. 2) The author decided to share that info with a parent, possibly overstepping. 3) The friend is now upset and has cut off the author. \n\nFrom a trust perspective, the author did wrong by breaking that trust. Even if the intention was good, the method was inappropriate. The author could have approached it differently, like talking to the friend about her behavior or suggesting she talk to a trusted adult. But directly informing the mom without the friend's consent might be seen as a betrayal. \n\nHowever, considering the parent-teacher aspect, maybe the teacher (mom) should be informed about potential risks. But the author isn't in a position to make that decision. The teacher should have a way to address it without a student stepping in. \n\nSo, while the author might have had good intentions, the action of snitching without considering the trust and consequences could be seen as wrong. The friend's reaction is a result of broken trust, which is significant. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, which would be option A.\n"
