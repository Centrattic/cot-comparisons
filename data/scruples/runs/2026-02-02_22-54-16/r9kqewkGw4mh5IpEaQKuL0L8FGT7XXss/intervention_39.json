At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, told the author (also 15) about her sexual activities and sleeping around. The author then told the girl's mother, who is also their teacher, leading to the friend cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend shared personal information with the author, which is a breach of privacy. However, the author decided to inform the mother, perhaps out of concern. But here's the thing: minors have a right to privacy, but there's also the aspect of parental responsibility. However, the author is also a minor, so their capacity to make such a judgment might be questioned.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality and the right to privacy. When someone shares personal and sensitive information, even if it's inappropriate, the listener isn't necessarily obligated to report it unless there's a legal duty, like if a minor is in danger. In this case, the friend is engaging in sexual activity, which could be a legal concern if she's under the age of consent. However, the user is 15, and the girl's age isn't specified, but she lost her virginity at 13. Depending on the jurisdiction, 13 might be below the age of consent, which could make it a legal issue. If that's the case, then the author might have a duty to report it. But if the age of consent is higher than 13 in their area, it's a different scenario.\n\nAnother angle is the trust between friends. The friend shared personal details expecting confidentiality. By breaking that trust, the author damaged their relationship. Even if the intention was good, the action violated that trust. The mother might have a right to know, but the author isn't the parent, so they overstepped by disclosing private information.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. Was it out of genuine concern for the friend's well-being, or was it a judgmental act? The post mentions considering the mother's perspective, which suggests a concern for the friend's actions, but the method of addressing it was problematic. Instead of talking to the friend directly or involving a trusted adult, the author chose to go straight to the mother with detailed info from a peer.\n\nIn many cases, involving parents without considering the friend's autonomy and the potential consequences (like the friend being cut off) can be seen as overstepping. The author's action led to the friend cutting them off, which indicates a breach of trust. Even if the author thought they were right, the method was inappropriate. So, in terms of being the \"asshole,\" the author likely is in the wrong because they violated confidentiality without a clear justification beyond personal concern, which doesn't outweigh the friend's right to privacy.\n"
