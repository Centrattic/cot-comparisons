At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling the friend's mom about her sexual activities. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who's been sharing details about her relationships, including losing her virginity at 13. The author, also 15, decided to tell the mother, leading to the friend cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is around 16 or 18, so if the girl lost her virginity at 13, that might be a legal issue if she had sex with someone older. But the author is 15, same age as the friend. However, even if both are minors, sharing such personal information without consent can be a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's reasoning was putting themselves in the mother's shoes, thinking the mother would want to know. But does that justify the action? Trust is crucial in friendships. By sharing private details, the author broke that trust. Even if the intention was to protect, the method of involving the mother directly might be seen as betrayal.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior\u2014talking about relationships and casual sex\u2014might not be the fault of the friend, but the author's response was to involve a parent, which could be seen as overstepping. Unless there was a clear risk of harm, which the story doesn't specify, the author's action might be considered wrong. The friend's actions don't necessarily make her the villain; the author's breach of confidentiality is the key issue here.\n"
