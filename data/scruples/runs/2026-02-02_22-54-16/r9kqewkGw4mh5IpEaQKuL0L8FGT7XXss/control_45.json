At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 15-year-old guy told his friend about his other friend's behavior, specifically that she sleeps around and lost her virginity at 13. The friend's mom is also a teacher, and he went to her with the info.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information with you, even if it's something you don't agree with, there's an expectation of privacy. The author didn't ask for permission to share that info with the mother. So, that's a point against him.\n\nThen, the age factor. At 15, both the author and his friend are minors. In some places, sharing such personal details about a peer's sexual activity could have legal implications, especially if it's considered a breach of privacy. Also, the friend lost her virginity at 13, which might be a sensitive age, but the author didn't consider if that was relevant to report to a parent.\n\nIntentions matter too. The author claims he did it thinking about the mother's perspective. But is it his place to decide what's best for the mother? He might have thought he was helping, but without knowing the full context, he made a judgment call. The friend was upset and stopped talking to him, which shows it hurt their relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the friend was open about her relationships. If she didn't want that information shared, then the author violated her trust. Even if he didn't see a problem with her behavior, sharing it without consent is a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the consequences. The friend is now upset, and the relationship is broken. The author might have caused unnecessary harm. The mother believed him eventually, which led to the friend's reaction. The author didn't consider how sharing explicit details might affect his friend's reputation or relationships.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the main issues here are privacy, consent, and the impact of his actions. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing, acting without the friend's consent and without a clear obligation to report (like if there was legal harm) makes him responsible for breaking trust.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably A\u2014the author is in the wrong for snitching without considering privacy and trust.\n"
