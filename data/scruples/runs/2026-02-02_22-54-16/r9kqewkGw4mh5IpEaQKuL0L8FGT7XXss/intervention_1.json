At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the friend's mom about her explicit behavior. The situation is that the friend, who's 15, was talking a lot about sleeping around, and the author, also 15, told her mom, who's a teacher. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to the author anymore.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The friend was sharing personal details about her relationships and sex life with the author. The author felt it was wrong and thought the mother should know. But is it the author's place to do that?\n\nIn many places, the age of consent and what's considered appropriate for a 15-year-old's behavior can vary, but sharing someone's private information without their consent is usually seen as a violation of privacy. Even if the author thought it was for the friend's good, disclosing that information to a parent might not be their responsibility. The author might have felt concerned, but they didn't go through the proper channels, like talking to a trusted adult first or the school counselor instead of directly telling the mother. Also, the friend might feel that the author betrayed her trust, which is a big deal in any friendship.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is a teacher, so maybe the author thought it was their duty to report something concerning. But even then, the appropriate way would be to approach a school administrator or a counselor, not the mother directly, especially since the mother is a parent figure. Plus, the author is a minor, so their judgment might not be fully mature. They could have misunderstood the situation or overstepped their role.\n\nAnother angle: the friend lost her virginity at 13. Depending on the location, that could be a legal issue if there were any non-consensual elements or if she was with someone underage. However, the author's disclosure might have led to consequences that weren't fair to the friend if there were no actual legal issues. The author might have acted out of fear or misunderstanding, thinking they were helping, but causing harm instead.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely breached the friend's confidentiality without a valid reason beyond their own perception. The right approach would have been to seek advice first or involve authorities if there was a genuine safety concern. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
