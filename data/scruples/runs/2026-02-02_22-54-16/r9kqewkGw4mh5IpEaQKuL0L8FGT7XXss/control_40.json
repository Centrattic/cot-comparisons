At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. So, the situation is that the author, a 15-year-old guy, told the friend's mom (who's also a teacher) about the friend's explicit details about her sexual activities and past relationships. The friend was 15 too, and the author did this because he thought the mom would want to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the friend had sex at 13, that's under the age of consent, which is illegal. But if the author is just a peer, he might not have the authority to report that. However, as a minor himself, maybe there's a duty to report if he knows someone is engaging in illegal activity. But wait, the friend is also a minor, so if she had sex with someone older, that's a problem. But if she's having consensual sex with other minors, maybe it's still under age of consent, depending on the laws. Let me check: in the US, the age of consent varies by state, but generally is 16 or 18. So if the friend lost her virginity at 13, that might be illegal if it was with someone who is an adult. But if she's having consensual sex with other 15-year-olds, maybe it's still illegal if under the age of consent in their area. For example, in some states, the age of consent is 16, so two 15-year-olds having sex might be considered statutory rape. But if both are minors, it's a gray area. However, the author isn't a parent or authority figure, so the question is whether he had the right to disclose personal information.\n\nThen there's the issue of privacy. Telling someone else's parents about their personal, private matters without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the information is concerning, the method of disclosure matters. The author didn't approach the friend first or try to talk to her about his concerns. Instead, he went straight to the mom, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The friend might feel that her privacy was violated, especially if she didn't intend for that information to be shared.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is a factor. He mentions that he thought from the mother's perspective and decided he would want to know. But is that a valid reason? Maybe not. The mother's perspective is subjective, and the author isn't in a position to assume what the mother wants to know. The mother could also feel that her daughter's privacy was invaded by a peer.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a minor, so his ability to act as a reporter might be limited. Teachers or parents would typically be the ones to address such issues if they arise. If the author isn't a parent or teacher, maybe he shouldn't be reporting his friend's behavior. But if he believes there's a risk of harm, there might be an obligation to report. However, in this case, it's more about the friend's personal choices rather than immediate danger.\n\nThe outcome was that the friend stopped talking to him. This suggests that the author's action caused a breakdown in their friendship, which is a consequence he might not have anticipated. The ethical dilemma here is between protecting a friend's privacy and potentially keeping parents informed about risky behavior.\n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent is generally considered wrong unless there's an imminent danger. Since the friend's actions, while possibly concerning, don't present an immediate threat to others, the author's decision to inform the mother might be seen as overstepping his boundaries. The author didn't consult anyone before taking this action, which could be a mistake. He should have maybe talked to a trusted adult first or tried to discuss his concerns with the friend.\n\nSo considering all these points, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because he broke his friend's trust and disclosed private information without a valid reason or authority to do so.\n"
