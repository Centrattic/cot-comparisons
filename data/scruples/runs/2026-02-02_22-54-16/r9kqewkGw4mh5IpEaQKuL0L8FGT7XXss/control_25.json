At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on his friend. The situation is that the friend told him she sleeps around a lot, and he told her mom (who's also his teacher) about it, including that she lost her virginity at 13. Now they're not talking anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information with you, especially about their personal life, there's an expectation of trust. The author told the friend's mother without her consent. Even if he thought it was for her own good, sharing someone's private details without permission is a breach of trust.\n\nThen there's the age factor. Both the author and the friend are 15. At that age, people are still learning about boundaries and privacy. The friend might not have realized the implications of sharing such information, but the author had a responsibility to respect her privacy unless there was a legal obligation to report something harmful. Sleeping around isn't inherently harmful to others, unless it involves underage sex, which in many places is illegal. However, the post doesn't specify that there's any underage activity beyond the loss of virginity at 13, which is allowed in some places but not others. But maybe even that isn't a legal issue if it was consensual and within legal age.\n\nThe author's reasoning was from the mother's perspective. He thought the mother would want to know. But that's assuming he knows what the mother would want, which he doesn't. Even if the mother was a teacher and a parent, the student shouldn't be the one deciding to share private student information. There are confidentiality laws in education, like FERPA in the US, which might require permission to share such info. The author might have violated that by telling the teacher/mother without consent.\n\nAlso, the result is that the friend is upset and they're no longer talking. The author's action led to a breakdown in their friendship. Even if the motive was good, the method was inappropriate. Friends trust each other to keep secrets unless there's a serious risk involved. Sleeping around isn't a risk to others, so the author overstepped.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he breached the friend's privacy without a valid reason or legal obligation, leading to harm in their friendship and violating trust.\n"
