At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the friend's mom about her explicit behavior.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 15, same age as the friend. They become friends, she shares a lot about her sexual activity. The author then decides to tell her mom, who is also a teacher, about these details, including losing virginity at 13. The friend is upset and now avoids the author.\n\nSo, the main question here is about trust and privacy. When someone shares personal information, even if it's something that others might find concerning, there's an expectation that it stays confidential. The author didn't ask the friend if she wanted them to keep it private, but since they were friends, it's implied that the information is not to be shared without consent. \n\nThe author's justification was putting themselves in the mother's position, thinking the mom would want to know. But from a legal and ethical standpoint, the author isn't the parent. The mother has a right to be informed about her child's well-being, but the friend had no right to disclose personal details without the daughter's consent. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend was 15 and lost her virginity at 13 might be a legal issue depending on the jurisdiction, but that's a different angle. However, the question is more about the author's actions rather than the friend's behavior. \n\nSince the author shared confidential information without the friend's permission, that's a breach of trust. Even if the author had good intentions, the action was snitching, which in this context is considered a violation of the friend's privacy. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's privacy and shared personal details without consent, leading to the friend's resentment. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
