At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their friend's behavior to her mom is in the wrong. The key points here are the age of the individuals involved, the nature of the information shared, and the context of the disclosure.\n\nFirst, both the author and their friend are 15 years old. In many places, this is below the age of consent for sexual activity, which is typically 16 or 18 depending on the jurisdiction. If the friend lost her virginity at 13, that's well below the legal age in most places, making it a potential legal issue. The author might be concerned about underage sexual activity, which is a valid concern from a legal standpoint.\n\nHowever, the friend shared this information with the author in confidence. By reporting it to a teacher (who is also her mother), the author broke that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, the friend didn't consent to her personal information being shared. The mother's reaction and the subsequent fallout where the friend refuses to talk to the author highlight the breach of trust.\n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they were protecting the friend by informing a parent. On the other, the friend's privacy was violated. The author didn't seek the friend's permission or try to address the situation directly with her first. Instead, they went straight to the parent, which can be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe question is whether the author's action was justified. While underage sexual activity is concerning, the method of handling it matters. The author could have approached the friend first, expressed concerns, or sought advice from a trusted adult without disclosing private details. Instead, they chose to report it without considering the personal consequences on the friend.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions were good, sharing explicit private information without the friend's consent likely makes them the asshole, as it breaches trust and could have legal implications depending on the situation.\n"
