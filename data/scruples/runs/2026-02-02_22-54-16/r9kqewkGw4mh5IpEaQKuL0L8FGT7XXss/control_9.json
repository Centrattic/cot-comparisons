At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a 15-year-old who befriended another girl who's also 15. They bonded over shared interests, and the friend started talking about her sexual experiences, including losing her virginity at 13. The author decided to tell the friend's mom, who is also a teacher, all the details. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author anymore. The question is whether the author is the asshole for snitching.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and trust in a friendship. When someone shares personal things with you, even if they're inappropriate, there's an expectation that those details stay between you and them. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by informing the mother, thinking it's a protective action. But did they have the right to do that without the friend's consent?\n\nNext, the age factor: both are 15. In many places, 15 isn't a minor in terms of legal responsibility, but the mother might still be involved in her child's life. However, the friend's actions, while perhaps not illegal, are personal choices. The author's decision to share this information could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the mother was a teacher, does that give the author the authority to act as a go-between?\n\nThen there's the motive. The author mentions they considered the mother's perspective and wanted to inform her. But was it their place to do so? Friends usually expect discretion. By sharing the information, the author might have violated that trust, leading to the friend cutting ties. The mother might appreciate knowing, but the method of finding out through a friend's report instead of directly from her could cause issues.\n\nLegal aspects: In some places, there are laws about reporting underage sexual activity if there's a risk of harm, but if it's consensual between minors, maybe not. However, the friend's behavior isn't necessarily illegal, just something the mother might disapprove of. The author didn't report a crime but shared personal information, which is more about privacy.\n\nEthically, the author's action hinges on trust and consent. Without the friend's permission to share her secrets, the author acted without consent. Even if the intention was good, the method was invasive. The result is the loss of the friendship, which is a significant consequence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely overstepped by sharing personal details without the friend's consent. The mother might have a right to know, but the author wasn't in a position to act as a third party. The friend's trust was broken, leading to the friendship ending. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
