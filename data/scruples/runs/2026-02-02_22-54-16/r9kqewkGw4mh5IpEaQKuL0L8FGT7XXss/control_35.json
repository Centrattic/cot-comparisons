At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The friend is a 15-year-old girl who told her friend about sleeping around a lot. The friend in question, the author, decided to tell the girl's mom, who is also their teacher, all the explicit details, including losing her virginity at 13. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, sharing someone's private information without consent, even if you think it's for their own good, can be a violation of their privacy. The girl shared these details with the author in confidence, and breaking that trust by informing a teacher and parent might be crossing a line. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that they tried to see it from the mother's perspective and wanted to protect her. But does that justify breaching confidentiality? It's possible the mother has a right to know if her child is engaging in risky behavior, especially if it might affect her safety. However, the author's method might be problematic. Reporting to a teacher (who is also the mother) without first addressing the issue with the friend directly could have been a better approach. \n\nAlso, the friend was 15, so there's the consideration of minors and whether parental involvement is necessary. In some cases, parents have a right to be informed about their child's activities for their well-being. However, the author didn't consult the mother first, just took it upon themselves to share explicit details, which might have been more than necessary. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the friendship. The friend is now upset and cutting off contact. The author might have damaged a relationship over something they felt was important, but handled in a way that didn't allow the friend to explain or resolve the issue on her own. \n\nThere's also the question of consent. The friend didn't agree for that information to be shared. Even if the author thought it was right, without consent, it's a breach of trust. The fact that the author shared explicit details might have also been excessive. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intention might have been to protect the friend's mother, the method of handling it by directly snitching without discussing it with the friend first or getting consent is likely the wrong approach. The trust was broken, and the friendship was damaged. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
