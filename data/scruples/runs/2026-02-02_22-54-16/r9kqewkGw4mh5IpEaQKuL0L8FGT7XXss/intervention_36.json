At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that a 15-year-old girl shared explicit details about her sexual activities with her male friend, who then told her mom, who's also his teacher. The friend is now upset and isn't talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are 15, which is a minor, so their decision-making might not be as mature. The girl was talking about her sexual experiences, including losing her virginity at 13. The author, thinking from his mother's perspective, decided to inform her. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author have a right to share this information? The friend shared this with him, possibly in confidence. By telling the mother, he broke that trust. Even if he thought he was doing the right thing, he didn't check with the girl or her mom first. The mother's initial reaction was disbelief, but then she believed him, leading to the girl's anger.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between confidentiality and duty to protect. Since the mother is the parent, she has a right to know about her child's wellbeing. However, the author didn't have a legal obligation to report this. He acted on his own judgment without consulting anyone else. \n\nAlso, the friend might have shared this information expecting it to stay private. Breaking that trust could damage their friendship. Even if the mother's intention is to protect her daughter, the method of disclosure was through a friend, which might not be appropriate. \n\nLegally, minors can't legally consent to certain relationships depending on the jurisdiction, but the user didn't mention any illegal activities. The main issue here is about trust and privacy. The author's action could be seen as crossing a boundary by sharing personal information without consent. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had good intentions, breaching confidentiality without a clear necessity or legal mandate makes him responsible for the fallout. The answer is likely A (he is in the wrong) because he violated trust, even if the motivation was to protect.\n"
