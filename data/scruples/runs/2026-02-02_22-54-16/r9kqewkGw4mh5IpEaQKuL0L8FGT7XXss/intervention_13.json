At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a 15-year-old boy told another student's mother that her daughter sleeps around and lost her virginity at 13. The friend found out and is now upset.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning was that he put himself in the mother's shoes and thought she'd want to know. But wait, even if he thought that, did he have the right to share such personal information? The friend shared these details with him in confidence, right? So by telling the mother without the friend's consent, he breached that trust. \n\nAlso, the friend is 15, same age as the author. They're both minors, and the mother is also a teacher. Maybe the author felt the need to inform the teacher because of the mother-teacher role, but is that a valid reason? The friend's privacy is important, and even if the actions are something a parent might be concerned about, the author didn't go through the proper channels, like talking to the parent directly but not in such explicit detail. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have thought he was helping, but revealing such personal information without consent can damage a friendship and trust. The friend being 15 and making her own choices might be a part of her autonomy. The author's action led to the friend cutting off communication, which seems like a significant consequence. \n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private information without consent, even if the intention is to protect someone, can be considered a breach of trust. Unless there's a legal or ethical obligation, like harm to oneself or others, which doesn't seem to be the case here. The friend's sexual activity, while possibly a concern for her parents, doesn't necessarily require an adult to intervene if the friend isn't in immediate danger. \n\nSo, the author's action was based on his own judgment of what the mother would want to know, but that doesn't justify the breach of confidentiality. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
