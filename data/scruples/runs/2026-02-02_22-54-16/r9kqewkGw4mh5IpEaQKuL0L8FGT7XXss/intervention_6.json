At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a 15-year-old girl shared personal details about her sexual activities with her friend, the author, who then told her mom, who's also a teacher. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to the author anymore. The author's reasoning is that they tried to put themselves in the mother's shoes and thought the mom should know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Sharing someone's private information without their consent is usually a big no-no. The friend confided in the author, expecting confidentiality. Even if the author's intention was to protect the friend by informing her mother, that doesn't necessarily justify breaking trust. Privacy is important, especially for teenagers who might be exploring their identities. \n\nAlso, the author is the same age as the friend, so maybe they didn't fully understand the consequences of their actions. The mother being a teacher complicates things because there's a duty of care, but the author wasn't in a position to make that judgment. Maybe the mother should have addressed the behavior if she was concerned, but the author stepping in might have overstepped.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought they were doing the right thing by involving an adult. However, the friend is a minor, so her parents have a right to know certain things, but the line is crossed when the information is shared without consent. The key here is the breach of trust. Even if the intentions were good, the method of sharing private details without the friend's permission is problematic. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's action of snitching led to a broken friendship and violated the friend's privacy. While the intention might have been to help, the means were not appropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
