At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, was talking about sleeping around, including losing her virginity at 13. The author, also 15, told her mom, who is a teacher. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the girl was 13 when she lost her virginity, that's definitely below the legal age in most jurisdictions. So, there could be a legal issue here, like statutory rape. If that's the case, the author might have a duty to report it, especially since the teacher is an authority figure. \n\nBut wait, the author is a peer. The teacher might be in a better position to handle it. However, the author went directly to the mom/teacher without going through official channels. Maybe the teacher is now aware, so maybe that's okay. But the author's role here is a bit tricky because they're a student themselves, not an authority figure. \n\nEthically, the author thought from the mother's perspective and wanted to protect her. But by snitching, the author breached the friend's trust. Even if the information is sensitive, sharing it without consent can damage the relationship. The friend might feel betrayed. So, there's a conflict between protecting the friend's mom and respecting the friend's privacy.\n\nAlso, the author didn't go to school authorities first. Maybe they should have reported it through the proper channels. But since the teacher is the mom, maybe that's a conflict of interest. The teacher might not handle it objectively. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Legally, maybe not if they were reporting illegal activity. Ethically, it's more complicated. The author's intentions were to protect the mother, but the method of sharing personal information without consent could be seen as violating trust. Friends are supposed to keep secrets unless there's a danger involved. Here, the danger is legal and emotional, but the author's action caused a fallout in the friendship. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the context. If the situation involves potential illegal activity, the author might be justified. But if it's more about moral judgment without legal implications, then the author overstepped. But since losing virginity at 13 is under the age of consent in many places, the author might be right to inform the mother. However, the way they did it, directly to the mom without going through official channels, might be problematic. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have approached school counselors instead of the friend's mom, who is also a teacher. But maybe the school requires reporting to the parent if it's a legal issue. Still, the author is a student, so maybe they weren't responsible for that. \n\nIn summary, the author's action might be legally justified if they were reporting a crime, but ethically, they might have breached trust. So the answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't follow proper reporting procedures and damaged the friendship. But if the legal aspect is the main point, maybe B (not in the wrong) because they tried to protect the mother. It's a tough call.\n"
