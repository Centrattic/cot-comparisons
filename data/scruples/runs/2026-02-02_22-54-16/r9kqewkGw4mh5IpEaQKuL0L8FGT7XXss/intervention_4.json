At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for snitching on their friend by telling her mom about her sexual activities. The author is a 15-year-old boy who met a girl in class, and they became friends. The girl talked a lot about her past relationships and sleeping around. The author decided to tell her mom, who is also his teacher, in explicit detail, including that she lost her virginity at 13. Now the friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is 15, so she's a minor. In many places, sharing such information with a parent or guardian might be seen as trying to get help. However, the author didn't go directly to the parent first; he just told the teacher. Also, the mother initially thought the daughter was making it up but then believed the author. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to him anymore.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The girl didn't share these details with the author to have them reported. Even if the author thought he was acting in the friend's best interest, sharing private information without consent is a problem. However, if the author believed there was a risk to her well-being, maybe he felt justified. But the story doesn't mention any immediate danger, just that she's sexually active, which is her choice as a teenager. \n\nIn many school policies, teachers are mandatory reporters for certain issues, but here the author is a student, not a teacher. So he's not in a position to report her. The mother is the teacher here, which is why the author approached her. But even so, the friend might have expected confidentiality from her peer. The author's actions led to the friend being upset and their friendship ending. \n\nLegally, in some cases, sharing someone's private information like that could be a breach of privacy. Ethically, it's about trust and boundaries. The friend shared these details with the author, expecting some level of confidentiality, and the author broke that trust. Unless there was a legal obligation to report (like abuse or exploitation), which isn't mentioned here, the author overstepped. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he violated his friend's privacy and trust without a compelling reason. Even if his intentions were to protect, he didn't handle it appropriately. The friend's sexual activity, while perhaps concerning to some, is her personal choice, and the author shouldn't have shared it without consent.\n"
