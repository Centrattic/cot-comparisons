At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend by telling her mom about her sexual activities. The author is 15, and the friend is also 15. The friend shared personal details, and the author thought from the mother's perspective, so they told the mother. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend voluntarily shared her experiences with the author. The author then decided to inform the mother, possibly out of concern. But since the friend is a minor, the mother might have a right to know about her child's activities, especially if there's a risk of underage sexual activity. However, the author is also a minor, so their judgment might be influenced by their own age, not fully understanding the consequences. \n\nIn some places, laws might require reporting underage sexual activity, but the author isn't a legal guardian. The key issue here is consent and confidentiality. The friend trusted the author with personal information, and the author broke that trust by sharing it without consent. Even if the author had good intentions, the act of sharing without permission can damage the friendship and privacy.\n\nAlso, the mother is a teacher, so there might be a power dynamic here. The author might have felt pressured to tell the teacher-mother, but that doesn't justify breaking the friend's trust. The friend's privacy is important, even if the actions are something the parent might want to address. \n\nSo, while the author might have thought they were doing the right thing for the friend's own good, they violated the trust and privacy. The mother should have been informed through appropriate channels, but the author's approach was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
