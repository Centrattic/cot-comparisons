At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 15-year-old guy who confided in his friend about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13 and her current interest in her BFF. The user then told the friend's mom, who is also his teacher, all the explicit details. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him, leading him to ask if he's the asshole for snitching.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of privacy. The friend shared personal information with the user, expecting confidentiality. By disclosing that to her mom, the user violated her trust. Even if he thought it was for her own good, sharing such details without consent is a breach of privacy.\n\nNext, the age factor. Both are 15, so they're minors. The friend's mom is a teacher, which adds a professional relationship aspect. The user might have thought the teacher has a duty to inform the mother, but as a student, he's not in a position to report personal information about another student to a teacher unless there's a clear risk or harm involved. Since the friend's actions, while perhaps risky, don't necessarily indicate immediate danger, the duty to report might not apply here.\n\nIntentions matter too. The user says he tried to see it from the mother's perspective and felt she should know. But friends are supposed to keep each other's secrets unless there's a compelling reason to share. The user's action was to inform the mother, not to protect the friend from harm, which is a key distinction. If there were signs of abuse or coercion, it might be different, but the scenario as described doesn't mention that.\n\nConsequences are also important. The friend is now upset and has cut off contact. The user probably caused her embarrassment and loss of trust. Even if the mother believes him, the damage to their friendship is significant. The user should have considered that the information might be private and that sharing it could lead to negative outcomes for the friend.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's action of sharing his friend's private information with her mother without her consent or a clear justification (like preventing harm) is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
