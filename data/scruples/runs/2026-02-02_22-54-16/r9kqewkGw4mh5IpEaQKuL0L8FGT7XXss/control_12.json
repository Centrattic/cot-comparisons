At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend by telling her mom about her explicit details regarding sleeping around. The author is a 15-year-old guy, and the friend is also 15 (15f). The situation involves the friend sharing personal information, and the author deciding to inform her mother, who's also a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend confided in the author, so that's about trust. When someone shares personal details, especially about their relationships and sex life, they might expect confidentiality. The author kept quiet for a month, which could indicate he was conflicted. Then he decided to inform the mother, which led to the friend cutting off communication.\n\nNow, the mother is also a teacher. So the author might have thought that as a teacher, it's her job to look out for the student. But the friend was 15, so maybe the mother isn't aware of the daughter's activities, and the author felt it was necessary. However, the friend was an adult at 15, so perhaps she had the right to privacy.\n\nBut wait, in some contexts, especially in schools, teachers might be required to report certain things, like if there's a risk to the student or others. However, the author isn't a teacher; he's a student. So his role here is as a peer. The question is, does he have the right to share such personal information without the friend's consent?\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the friend lost her virginity at 13. Depending on the location, the age of consent might be relevant. If 13 is below the age of consent, then there could be legal implications, but the friend is 15 now, so maybe that's not the case here. The user didn't specify the location, but in many places, the age of consent is 16 or higher. If the friend was 13, and the author is 15, the author was 12 at the time. That complicates things because both were minors, but maybe the author is in a different position now.\n\nHowever, the main issue is privacy and trust. The friend shared this information with the author in confidence. By revealing it, the author broke that trust. Even if he thought he was doing it for a good reason, like the mother's concern, the act of snitching without the friend's permission is a violation. Unless there was a valid reason like immediate harm, which isn't mentioned here, the author overstepped. The friend's reaction is understandable because she likely felt betrayed. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because he violated her privacy and trust without a necessary justification.\n"
