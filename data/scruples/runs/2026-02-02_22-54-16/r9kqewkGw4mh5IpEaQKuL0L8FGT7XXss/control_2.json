At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend's mom about her sexual activities is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend (15f) shared explicit details about sleeping around with the author, who is also 15. The author then reported this to the friend's mom, who is a teacher. The friend is now upset and won't talk to the author. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing.\n\nSo, the key points here. The friend shared private information with the author, expecting it to be confidential. The author took it upon themselves to inform the mother without the friend's consent. The mother then believed the information, leading to the friend's anger. \n\nNow, considering the age of the individuals involved: both are 15. In many places, 15 is a minor, and there aren't strict legal obligations for minors to report everything. However, there's a difference between sharing and reporting. The author used the justification that they put themselves in the mother's shoes, thinking the mother would want to know. But is that a valid reason to breach confidentiality?\n\nConfidentiality is a big part of trust in friendships. When someone shares personal information, they usually do so under the assumption that it won't be spread. The author's action might have been motivated by concern, but it's not the friend's mom that's the issue; the way the information was disclosed without consent is the main point. \n\nAlso, the mother is a teacher, which might imply she's in a position of authority. However, the author isn't a teacher here. The author's decision to report to the mother could be seen as overstepping, especially without knowing if the mother's consent was given for the daughter to share such information.\n\nAnother angle: if the author was worried about the friend's well-being, maybe they should have talked to a trusted adult, not the mother directly. But the author's action bypassed that and went straight to the parent, which might have been unnecessary and invasive.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, in some regions, mandatory reporting laws might require reporting certain activities if there's suspicion of abuse or harm. But in this case, the friend is willingly engaging in these activities, so it's not a case of abuse. The author doesn't mention any signs of coercion or danger, so it's more about the friend's choices, not her safety. \n\nSo, the main issue here is trust and privacy. The author broke the trust by sharing private information without the friend's consent, leading to the friend's anger and loss of friendship. Even if the author had good intentions, the action itself was a violation of privacy. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because they disclosed confidential information without consent, which is a breach of trust.\n"
