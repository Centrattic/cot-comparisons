At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl sharing explicit details about her sexual activities with her friend, who then tells her mom, who is also a teacher. The friend is upset and no longer talks to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially with a friend, there's an expectation that it stays private unless there's a legal obligation to report. The friend didn't ask for advice or express distress, just shared her experiences. So the snitch might have broken that trust without a clear justification.\n\nNext, the legal aspect. In many places, minors can't legally consent to sexual activity with others of similar age. If the girl lost her virginity at 13, depending on the jurisdiction, that might involve legal issues. However, the snitch didn't report it to authorities but told the mother. The mother might not have known, but the snitch's role as a student might not require them to report unless there's a specific duty, which they don't have here.\n\nIntentions matter. The snitch thought from the mother's perspective and decided to act out of concern. But is that enough? Friends aren't responsible for each other's behavior unless there's a risk of harm. The friend's actions, while maybe reckless, don't directly endanger the snitch or others. The result was breaking trust and damaging the friendship.\n\nEthically, even if the snitch thought they were doing the right thing for the friend's mom, sharing private info without consent is a breach of trust. The friend's right to privacy was violated, leading to her being upset. The snitch might believe they were helping, but the method was invasive and without the friend's consent.\n\nAlso, the snitch is 15 and not a parent or authority figure. Their role isn't to police their friend's behavior. The friend's actions, while perhaps not prudent, are her personal choice. Unless there's a threat to safety, it's not the snitch's place to intervene.\n\nIn conclusion, the snitch likely overstepped by sharing personal information without consent, leading to loss of trust. Even if their intent was to help the mother, the method was incorrect. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
