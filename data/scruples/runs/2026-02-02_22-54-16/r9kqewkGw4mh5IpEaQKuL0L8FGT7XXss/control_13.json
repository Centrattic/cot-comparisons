At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is a 15-year-old guy who snitched on his 15-year-old friend to her mom, who's also a teacher. The friend told him she sleeps around a lot, mentioned losing her virginity at 13, and now the mom believes him, leading to the friend being upset and cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author overheard private information and decided to share it with the friend's mother. But wait, the friend shared this with him, so maybe she didn't intend for others to know. However, the author's reasoning was that if he were in the mom's position, he'd want to know. But is that a valid justification?\n\nAt 15, the friend is a minor. The author is also a minor, but the mom is a teacher. Teachers have a responsibility to report certain behaviors, especially if there's potential harm involved. But the author isn't a teacher; he's a peer. So the question is, was it his place to report this? \n\nAnother angle: the friend's actions. Sleeping around, especially at 15 and losing virginity at 13, might be considered underage sexual activity. Depending on the location, the age of consent could come into play here. If the friend was engaging in activities that are illegal, then the author might think he's doing the right thing by informing the mom. But even if it's legal, sharing such personal info without consent is a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's motivation matters. If he felt the mom needed to know because the daughter's actions were harmful or risky, maybe there's a concern for her well-being. But if he was just uncomfortable or wanted to judge, that's different. The story says he tried to see it from the mom's perspective, so perhaps he believed it was for the friend's own good. However, youth relationships and autonomy can be complex. The mother might have a right to know if there are issues like coercion, substance abuse, or if the friend is in danger. But the author didn't provide that context. He just reported the explicit details. \n\nAlso, the friend's trust was broken. The user was confiding in him, and he shared that with her mom. That's a big betrayal. Even if the mom learned the truth later, the method was questionable. The friend might feel violated and lose trust in the author. \n\nLegal and cultural factors: In some places, if a minor shares sensitive information with another minor, the second minor isn't necessarily obligated to report it unless it's a mandatory reporter (like a teacher). Since the author isn't in that role, it's more about personal ethics. \n\nPossible consequences: The friend is now upset and not talking to the author. The mom might have taken actions the daughter didn't agree with. The author could be seen as betraying a friendship, even with good intentions. \n\nBut maybe the author thought he was protecting the friend. However, the right to privacy and autonomy is important, especially for teens. The mom would need to be the one to address it with her daughter, not a friend. \n\nSo, the author likely is in the wrong because he shared private information without the friend's consent, breaking trust, even if he thought he was acting in her best interest. The mother would have the responsibility to talk to her daughter, not the friend. The friend's actions, while perhaps concerning, are her personal choices unless there's direct harm or illegal activity, which the author didn't specify.\n"
