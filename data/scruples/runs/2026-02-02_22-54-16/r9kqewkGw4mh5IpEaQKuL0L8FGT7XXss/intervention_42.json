At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that a 15-year-old boy told his friend's mother about her explicit sexual activities. The friend mentioned sleeping around, losing her virginity at 13, and other details. The author thought from the mother's perspective and decided to tell her. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16, so 13 is below that. But since both are minors, maybe the mother should be informed. However, the friend might have shared this information in confidence, and the author broke that trust. \n\nThe author's intention was to protect the friend's mom, but was he the right person to disclose that info? The friend trusted him, so sharing without her consent could be seen as a betrayal. Even if the actions are concerning, does the author have the authority to act as a parent? Probably not. The mother should be informed if there's something wrong, but maybe through the right channels, like a teacher or counselor, not a friend. \n\nAlso, the author is the same age, so maybe he's overstepping by taking on a parental role. The friend's reaction is understandable because trust was broken. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing, the method was wrong. \n\nSo, in terms of ethics, breaking confidentiality without a valid reason (like immediate harm) is usually wrong. The author didn't consult anyone before telling the mother, which could have been a better approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
