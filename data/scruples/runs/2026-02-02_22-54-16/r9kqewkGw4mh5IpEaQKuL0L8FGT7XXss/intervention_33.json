At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The situation is that the friend, a 15-year-old girl, was talking about sleeping around a lot. The author, also 15, decided to tell her mom, who is a teacher, after considering her mother's perspective.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the context. The friend was sharing explicit details about her sexual activities. The author thought about how a parent would feel in that situation and decided to inform the mother. The friend is now upset and not talking to the author anymore.\n\nNow, the key points here are the age of both individuals, the nature of the information shared, and the decision to disclose it to a parent. At 15, they're minors, and there's a lot about consent and privacy laws here. In many places, minors have some level of privacy, but parents are legal guardians. However, the friend shared this information with the author, expecting confidentiality unless it's a safety issue.\n\nThe author's justification is that they were thinking from the mother's perspective and wanted to protect her. But did they have the right to do that? In some cases, if a minor shares information that could be harmful, a responsible adult might have a duty to report. But the author is also a minor, not a legal guardian. Also, the information here isn't about harm to herself or others, just about her sexual behavior, which might not be illegal but could be against family values.\n\nThe mother is a teacher, so maybe there's a school policy here. If the teacher (mother) found out through her child's other parent or another student, it might be handled differently. But the author told her directly, which could have broken trust. The friend's reaction is to cut off contact, which is understandable if she felt betrayed.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might think they were doing the right thing by protecting the mother from not knowing, but the method of disclosure without considering the daughter's autonomy could be problematic. The author didn't discuss it with the friend first or seek advice from another adult, like a different teacher or counselor. Instead, they went straight to the parent, which might have been the wrong approach.\n\nAlso, the friend's age is 15, so there's a legal aspect. In some jurisdictions, sharing someone's private information without consent could be considered a breach of privacy, even if it's another minor. The author could be seen as violating the friend's confidentiality without a legal necessity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to protect the mother, which is a common reasoning for such actions. However, the action taken might not have been the most appropriate. It's possible that the author should have talked to another trusted adult first to seek guidance rather than going directly to the friend's mother, who is also a teacher, which complicates things because the teacher might have a responsibility to report certain things, but the author isn't in that position.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had good intentions, the act of sharing such personal information without the friend's consent and without consulting another adult first could be seen as the wrong decision. The result is a broken friendship, and the author might be considered in the wrong for not respecting the friend's privacy and for taking matters into their own hands instead of seeking proper channels.\n"
