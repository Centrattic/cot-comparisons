At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for snitching on their friend. The situation is that the friend, a girl, was talking about sleeping around, and the author told her mom, who's also a teacher. The friend is now upset and they're not talking anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15, same as their friend. They became friends because they shared common interests. The friend was open about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. The author thought from her mom's perspective and decided to tell the mom, leading to the friend's anger.\n\nThe key points here are consent and trust. The friend shared personal information with the author, expecting confidentiality. By telling the mom, the author breached that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, like worrying about the friend's well-being from her mom's perspective, the act of sharing private details without consent is a violation of privacy. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning might not hold up because they are the same age and not a parent. Decisions about a minor's behavior are typically between the parent and the child. The author isn't in a position to make that judgment or share private information. The friend's reaction is understandable\u2014she trusted the author, and that trust was broken. \n\nAnother angle is the potential impact. The friend might face consequences like her mom being upset or disciplinary actions. The author's action could have caused harm without ensuring that the mom's reaction was appropriate. Also, the author might have overstepped their role, assuming they know what's best. \n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent is seen as a breach of trust, regardless of the reason. The author's intention might be to help, but the method was wrong. The friend's behavior, while perhaps concerning, doesn't justify the author disclosing it without permission. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong. They violated the friend's trust and privacy, which is a significant issue. Even if they had good intentions, the action itself is problematic. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
