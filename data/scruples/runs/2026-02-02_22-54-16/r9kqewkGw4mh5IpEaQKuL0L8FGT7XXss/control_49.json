At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a friend's mother about her sexual activities. \n\nFirst, the author is 15, and so is the friend. The friend started sharing personal details about her relationships and sexual experiences. The author decided to tell the friend's mom, who is also a teacher. \n\nThe key issues here are privacy and consent. The friend didn't ask the author to keep her information private, but it's implied that she shared it in confidence. By telling the mother, the author broke that trust. \n\nEven if the author thought they were doing the right thing to protect the friend, maybe the mother should be informed, the method of doing so is questionable. The author didn't approach the friend first to talk about their concerns. Instead, they went straight to the mother, which could be seen as betrayal of trust. \n\nAlso, the friend is a minor, so there might be legal aspects, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. The author's action led to the loss of the friendship and the friend's anger, which shows the impact of the betrayal.\n\nEven if the author had good intentions, revealing someone's private information without their consent is generally considered wrong. The author didn't consider other options like talking to the friend first or seeking advice from a trusted adult themselves. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they violated the friend's privacy and trust without proper cause or discussion.\n"
