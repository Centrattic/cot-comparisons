At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a 15-year-old male) is in the wrong for telling his friend's mom about her sleeping around. So, the friend, also 15, confided in him about her sexual activities. He decided to tell her mom, who is also his teacher, leading to the friend cutting him off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information, especially in a friendship, there's an expectation of trust. The author didn't get permission to share these details, so that's a red flag. Even if he thought he was protecting her, breaking confidentiality without consent is usually a breach of trust.\n\nThen, the age aspect. Both are minors, so engaging in sexual activity at a young age can be a concern. However, the author isn't in a position to act as a guardian. His friend's mom is the parent, but the author had no right to share that info unless there was a legal obligation, which there isn't here. The friend losing her virginity at 13 is under the legal age in many places, but the author isn't a legal authority to report that. Unless there's a law about reporting underage sex, which varies by location, but generally, peers aren't required to report each other unless there's abuse or exploitation.\n\nIntent matters too. The author thought from the mom's perspective, implying he wanted to protect the friend. But the method was wrong. Instead of confronting the friend or talking to her mom through proper channels, he snitched directly, causing a breach of trust. The friend's reaction is understandable\u2014her privacy was violated.\n\nAlso, the relationship between the author and the teacher complicates things. Telling a teacher who's also a parent might not be appropriate without the student's consent. It could be seen as a conflict of interest.\n\nIn terms of the response, the author's action of snitching without consent is the issue. Even if his intention was good, the action was a breach of trust. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
