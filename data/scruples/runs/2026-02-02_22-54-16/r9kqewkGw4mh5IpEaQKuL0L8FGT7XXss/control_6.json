At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 15-year-old male, had a friend who is also 15 and shared a lot of common interests. The friend started talking about her past relationships and how she \"loves having sex without being in a relationship.\" The author kept quiet for a month, then decided to tell the girl's mom, who is also his teacher, all the details, including her losing virginity at 13. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend disclosed personal information to the author, expecting some level of confidentiality. The author didn't confront the friend or try to address the behavior but instead went straight to her mother. That seems like a breach of trust, especially since they were friends. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing by informing the mom, the method was to snitch without trying to understand or talk to the friend first.\n\nAlso, the fact that the mother is a teacher might be a point. Sometimes, teachers have a responsibility to report certain behaviors if they involve students, like underage sex or potential safety issues. But the friend is 15, so 13 might be underage depending on the location. However, the author didn't mention any legal issues or if the teacher was acting in her role. It seems like the author told the mom as a parent, not as a teacher. \n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. He said he thought from the mother's perspective and wanted to know if he were in her position. But instead of talking to the friend directly, he went to her mom. Friends are supposed to confide in each other, and sharing such private info without the friend's consent is a big violation. Even if the author had good intentions, the action of snitching without trying to address it with the friend first is problematic.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is to cut off contact, which is understandable if someone betrays her trust. The author might have overstepped by not considering the friend's autonomy and privacy. Unless there was a specific reason like the friend being in danger or harming others, it's usually not okay to share personal details like that. The age of 13 for losing virginity could be a red flag, but the author didn't check if the girl was being coerced or if it was legal. Maybe he assumed the worst, but still, the approach was wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author likely broke trust and didn't handle it the right way. The answer is probably A, meaning he's in the wrong.\n"
