At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on his friend to her mom. The friend is 15, and the author is also 15. The friend talked about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13. The author told her mom, who's also his teacher, leading to the friend being upset and cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality. When someone shares personal information with you, especially a friend, there's an expectation of privacy. The author didn't ask permission before going to the mom, so that's a breach of trust. Even if the author thought it was for the friend's own good, taking that step without consulting her first might be crossing a line.\n\nNext, the age factor. Both are 15, so they're minors. In some places, there might be legal implications about discussing someone's underage sexual activity. But the author's intention here was to inform the parent, not necessarily to report to authorities. Still, the parent's reaction led to the friend being upset. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that he put himself in the mom's shoes and thought he'd want to know. But friends aren't responsible for reporting each other's actions to their parents unless there's a legal duty, which in this case, there isn't. The author might have overstepped by not discussing it with the friend first to see if she wanted to address it herself.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is understandable. Trust is a big part of friendships, and breaking it like that can end the relationship. Even if the author's motives were good, the method was problematic. The friend might feel betrayed, especially since she shared personal details with him in confidence.\n\nLegal aspects: In some jurisdictions, there are laws about sharing someone's private information without consent, but since it's a parent and the information might be relevant to a minor's well-being, maybe there's a gray area. However, typically, friends don't have the authority to inform parents about their children's behavior unless it's a safety issue. The author didn't mention any safety concerns, just personal choices.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author likely violated the friend's trust without a valid reason. Even if the intention was to help, the action was a breach of privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
