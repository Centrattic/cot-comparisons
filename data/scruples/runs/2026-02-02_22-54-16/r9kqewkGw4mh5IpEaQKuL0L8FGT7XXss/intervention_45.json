At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The friend was talking about sleeping around, and the author told the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15, same as the friend. They became friends through shared interests. The friend was open about her sexual activity, including losing her virginity at 13. The author decided to tell the mom because they thought the mom should know. The friend is now upset and won't talk to them anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are confidentiality, the age of the individuals, and the appropriateness of the action taken. At 15, both are minors, and their parents might have a role in their lives. However, the friend shared this information with the author in confidence. By sharing it with the mother, the author broke that trust.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention might have been to protect the friend by informing the parent, thinking it's what a parent would want to know. But minors often have privacy rights, even in a parent-teacher setting. Also, the teacher (friend's mom) might have a responsibility to know if there's something affecting the student's well-being, but the author isn't in a position to make that call. \n\nWait, the author mentioned the teacher is also their mom. So, maybe the teacher has a duty to monitor the student's behavior, but the student's private information shouldn't be shared without consent. The author shared explicit details the friend told them, which could be a breach of trust. \n\nEven if the author thought they were doing the right thing, the act of disclosing private information without the friend's consent might be considered a violation of trust. Unless there's a legal obligation (like child endangerment), which doesn't seem to be the case here, the author might be in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the friend's actions (sleeping around at 15) aren't illegal, and the author isn't in a position to judge or report that. The parent has a right to know about their child's behavior, but the student's privacy is also important. However, the parent is also the teacher, so there might be a conflict of interest here. The author's action could have affected the friend's relationship with her parent, leading to fallout. \n\nIn school settings, students are supposed to maintain confidentiality unless there's a safety issue. Since the author didn't mention any safety concerns, just sharing the friend's personal life, it's more about privacy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for breaching that trust without a valid reason. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without consent, leading to a broken friendship and potential overreach in informing the parent/teacher without a clear justification beyond personal concern.\n"
