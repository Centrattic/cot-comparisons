At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl in their class who they had a lot in common with. Through their conversations, this friend started talking about her previous relationships and her casual approach to sex, including losing her virginity at 13. The author kept quiet for a month, but eventually decided to tell the girl's mom, who is also their teacher. The mom initially thought the daughter was making things up but later believed the author. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author. The author is a 15-year-old boy, and the friend is 15 as well.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by snitching. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate it.\n\nLet me consider the key points here. The author overheard or was told explicit details about the friend's sexual activities. The author then decided to report this to the mother, thinking about the mother's perspective. The friend is now upset, and there's a fallout.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting someone's well-being and respecting their privacy. The mother might have a right to know about her daughter's potentially risky behavior, especially if the daughter is under 18. However, the friend shared this information in confidence, and the author didn't ask for permission before sharing it. That could be a breach of trust.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the mother's right to know. If the daughter is engaging in unsafe or underage sexual activities, the parent should be informed. The author might have thought they were acting in the friend's best interest by alerting her mother. However, the author's role here is as a peer, not a parent or authority figure. The decision to share such personal information without consent can be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nAnother angle is the age. Both are 15, which is a minor age in most places. However, the mother is also a teacher, which adds a layer of professional responsibility. The teacher might have a duty to report certain behaviors, but the author is a student, not a teacher. So the author isn't in a position to make that judgment call.\n\nAlso, the friend shared these details with the author, trusting the conversation would be private. By sharing them with the mother, the author violated that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, the action caused harm to the friendship and potentially put the friend in a vulnerable position.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend's behavior is harmful\u2014like losing virginity at 13, which might be under the age of consent in some places\u2014it could be a valid concern. But the author's responsibility isn't to police their friend's behavior. That's the parent's role. The author's intervention might have been unnecessary and invasive.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, if the author is a minor, they might not have the authority to make such a report, and it could be seen as interfering in family matters. Also, the friend might not want her parents to know, and the author's action could lead to consequences like the friend being grounded or facing other punishments, which isn't the author's decision to make.\n\nSo weighing the options, the author's action was a breach of trust and an overstepping of their role. Even if the intention was to help, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
