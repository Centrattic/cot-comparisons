At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation involves the author telling the friend's mom about her sexual activities. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend, who is 15, shared explicit details about her relationships and sexual experiences with the author. The author, also 15, decided to inform her mom, who is a teacher. The friend is now upset and no longer talks to the author.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author crossed a boundary by sharing private information without consent. At 15, both the author and the friend are minors, and their relationships might be influenced by peer dynamics and a lack of full understanding of privacy and consequences.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they put themselves in the mother's shoes and thought the mom would want to know. But does that justify sharing someone else's private information? Privacy is a big deal. Even if the author's intention was to protect the friend or the mother, sharing such personal details without consent can damage trust and relationships. \n\nAlso, the friend might not have expected the author to disclose that information. The author might have overstepped by revealing explicit details, leading to the friend's backlash. Even if the mother believed the author, it doesn't make the action right. The author didn't consult the friend first or seek advice on how to handle it, which could have been a better approach.\n\nIn terms of the law and ethics, minors might not be in a position to make such decisions about sharing others' private information. It's possible that the author acted out of misplaced concern but without considering the friend's autonomy and right to privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, if the mother is a teacher, there might be a duty to report certain things, but the scenario doesn't mention any illegal activities or harm. The friend's behavior, while perhaps inappropriate for her age, might not be the author's place to report. \n\nConsidering all that, the author likely breached the friend's trust by sharing private information without consent, which is generally considered wrong. The action caused harm to the friendship and invaded the friend's privacy. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
