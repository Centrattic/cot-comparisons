At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (a 15-year-old boy) is in the wrong for telling his friend's mom about her sexual activities. The friend is also 15, and they shared personal information.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend told the author explicit details about sleeping around, including losing her virginity at 13. The author felt it was his duty to inform the mother, thinking about what he would want if he were the parent.\n\nSo, the key points are: confidentiality, consent, and the legal/ethical implications of sharing personal information. At 15, both are minors, and while they might share personal stuff, there's an expectation of privacy. The author didn't ask if the friend wanted to tell her mom, so that's a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, even if the author thought he was doing the right thing, sharing someone's private details without their consent can damage trust and relationships. The friend's reaction (no longer talking) suggests a significant fallout. \n\nLegally, maybe not in trouble, but ethically, the author overstepped. The friend's privacy was compromised. Even with good intentions, it's about consent and respecting boundaries. So the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
