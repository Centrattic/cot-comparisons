At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 15 and told his teacher, who's also his friend's mom, that his friend sleeps around and lost her virginity at 13. He did this because he thought her mom would want to know.\n\nFirst, privacy is a big factor here. The friend shared personal details with him, trusting their conversation was private. By sharing this with the mom, he broke that trust. Even if his intention was to protect her, it's not his place to decide that. At 15, he might not fully grasp the legal or ethical implications of sharing such info without consent. \n\nThen there's the method. The friend mentioned sleeping around but didn't ask for intervention. The user took it upon himself to inform the parent, which could be seen as overstepping. The friend's mom might not have been informed in a way that allows her to address the situation properly, especially since the daughter might not be ready for that conversation yet. \n\nAlso, the result is that the friend is now upset and doesn't talk to him. Trust is broken, and the relationship is ruined. Even if the user thought he was doing the right thing, the consequence is negative. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the friend's actions (sleeping around) aren't illegal, so reporting isn't necessary. The user's action is more about privacy breach than legal duty. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong because he violated his friend's privacy without her consent and caused harm to their relationship.\n"
