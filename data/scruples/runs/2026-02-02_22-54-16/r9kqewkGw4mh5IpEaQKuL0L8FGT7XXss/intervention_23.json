At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on their friend by telling the friend's mom about her sexual activities. The author is a 15-year-old boy, and the friend is a 15-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend shared personal details about sleeping around, and the author felt it was necessary to inform her mother, who is also a teacher. The friend is now upset and doesn't talk to the author anymore.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to share that information. Let me think about the concept of confidentiality and trust in friendships. When someone shares personal information, especially something as sensitive as sexual activity, it's usually done in confidence. Breaking that trust can be a big deal, even if the person has done something the other person disapproves of.\n\nThe author mentions that he considered the mother's perspective and thought the mother would want to know. But is it the author's place to decide that? Even if the mother is a teacher, are there boundaries about what a teacher should know from a student? Maybe the mother should be informed if there's something concerning, like underage sex or potential harm. But the author is just a peer. By bringing this up, he might have overstepped his role.\n\nAlso, the friend is 15, so she's a minor. The mother might have a right to know about her daughter's activities, but how does the author know that the mother isn't already aware? The author could have had a conversation with the mother without revealing specific details, maybe just expressing concerns. But instead, he told explicit details about the daughter's behavior, which could be seen as a violation of privacy.\n\nAnother point is the relationship between the two. The author was a friend, so trust is a key component. By snitching, the author broke that trust, leading to the end of the friendship. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing, the method of handling it (telling explicit details to the mother) might have been the wrong approach.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning was based on his own perspective as a parent. But maybe the mother already has a way to monitor her daughter's life, or she might handle it differently. The author's decision could have caused more harm than good, especially if the daughter feels betrayed and the mother is now involved in a way that's not helpful.\n\nIn terms of laws or policies, in some places, there are mandatory reporting requirements for certain things like abuse, but this is about consensual sexual activity. So the author isn't legally obligated to report that. It's more about a moral or ethical decision. However, the author is a peer, not a parent or authority figure. So while the intention might have been to protect, the action of violating confidentiality is still a breach of trust.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong. The friend shared personal information in confidence, and the author didn't have the right to disclose it, even if he thought it was for the friend's best interest. The appropriate action might have been to talk to the friend about his concerns instead of going to the mother directly. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
