At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snitching on his friend to her mom. The friend mentioned she sleeps around a lot, lost her virginity at 13, and talks about her relationships. The author told the mom, leading to their friendship ending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is 15, same age as the author. They're both minors. The author was told explicit details, which the friend shared voluntarily. The author decided to inform the mother (who's also a teacher) because he thought the mother would want to know. \n\nNow, from a privacy standpoint, the friend shared personal information with the author, trusting him. By telling her mom, the author breached that trust. Even if the author had good intentions, the act of disclosing private information without consent is problematic. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of parental rights. The mother might have a right to know if her child is engaging in risky behavior. However, the author isn't a parent, and the friend wasn't under his responsibility. The teacher might already be aware of the situation through other means, like being a parent and teacher. \n\nThere's also the consideration of the age. At 15, their judgment might not be fully mature. The friend's behavior could be seen as experimenting, but the author's decision to report it might be overstepping. The friend's privacy was violated, which could lead to trust issues. \n\nThe author's reasoning was from the mother's perspective, thinking he'd want to know. But he didn't consult the mother first, maybe he could have discussed it with the mother in a different way. Also, the mother initially thought the daughter was making it up, which might suggest that the daughter's behavior wasn't necessarily a problem from the mother's point of view.\n\nIn terms of the outcome, the friendship ended, which is a consequence of the author's action. Even if the author thought he was doing the right thing, the method was inappropriate. The key issue is consent. The friend didn't give permission for the author to share her personal information. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author likely breached trust, acted without consent, and caused harm to the friendship. Therefore, he is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
