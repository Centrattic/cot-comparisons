At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The friend is a 15-year-old girl who told the author about her sexual activities. The author, also 15, told the girl's mom, who is one of his teachers. The friend is now upset and won't talk to the author anymore.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was right to inform the mother. First, I need to consider privacy. The friend shared personal details with the author, trusting him. By telling her mom, he broke that trust. But maybe there's a justification. The author thought about the mother's perspective and decided he would want to know, so he told her. \n\nBut wait, at 15, both are minors. In many places, parents have a right to know about their child's behavior that could be harmful, like underage sex or potential STIs. However, the friend might have shared this information confidentially, expecting it to stay between them. The author didn't check with the friend if she wanted her mom informed. He just decided based on his own perspective.\n\nAlso, the consequence is that the friend no longer talks to him. That's a significant fallout. The author might have done it with good intentions, but without considering the friend's autonomy. Even if the mother is a teacher, the teacher might have a duty to report certain things, but the author isn't the teacher. The friend might have felt violated by the breach of trust.\n\nSo, the author's action was a breach of confidentiality. Unless there's immediate danger, sharing such personal info without consent is a problem. The author didn't consider the friend's wishes but acted based on his own assumption of what the mother would want. That's likely where the mistake is. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
