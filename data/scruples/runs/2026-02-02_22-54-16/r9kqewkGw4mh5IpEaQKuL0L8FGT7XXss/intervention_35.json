At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The friend, a 15-year-old girl, was talking a lot about sleeping around, including losing her virginity at 13. The author, also 15, told her mom (who's a teacher) about it. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the age of the individuals, the nature of the information shared, and the decision to report it to a parent/teacher. Since both are minors, there might be legal implications regarding consent and underage sexual activity. In many places, 13 is below the age of consent, so if the girl lost her virginity at 13, that could be a legal issue. However, the author isn't the parent, so they might have a moral dilemma about whether they should have said something.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have acted out of concern for the friend's well-being, thinking that the mother should know. On the other hand, the friend trusted the author with private information, and sharing that without consent breaches trust. The author also might have overstepped by providing explicit details, leading to a breakdown in their friendship.\n\nBut legally, if the girl is engaging in activities that are illegal due to her age, the author could have a duty to report it, especially since the mother is also a teacher. However, it's unclear if the author had a legal obligation to report. Additionally, sharing confidential information without the friend's consent could be seen as violating trust, even if the intentions were good.\n\nSo, there's a conflict between moral trust and potential legal responsibility. But since the author chose to act out of concern for the mother's perspective, maybe they felt it was the right thing. However, snitching in a friendship often leads to negative consequences. The answer might hinge on whether the situation required adult intervention versus respecting the friend's privacy.\n"
