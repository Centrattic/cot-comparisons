At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snitching on their friend to her mom. The friend, a 15-year-old girl, was sharing explicit details about her sexual activities with the author, and the author decided to tell her mom, who's also a teacher. The friend is now upset and the author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author had the right to share such personal information. The friend confided in the author, so there's an expectation of privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, like worrying about the friend's well-being or considering the mother's perspective, the act of revealing private details without consent is a breach of trust. Friends are supposed to keep each other's secrets unless there's a serious risk involved, like harm to the person or others. But in this case, the friend was talking about her own choices, even if they're not the author's personal preference. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the mother initially thought the daughter was making things up but later believed them. That might mean the author's disclosure led to some conflict or consequences for the friend. The friend's reaction is a clear sign that she felt betrayed. So, the author's action, while possibly motivated by concern, still violated the friend's confidentiality. \n\nAnother angle: the author is a minor, but that doesn't change the fact that sharing such personal information without consent is generally considered a breach of privacy. The mother being a teacher adds a layer because there's a duty of care, but the author isn't in a professional role. The teacher might have had the responsibility to address it, but the student sharing it directly could have been handled differently, maybe through the teacher's own observation or intervention. \n\nSo, even if the author thought they were doing something good, the act of snitching without a clear and present danger justification makes them the asshole. The trust was broken, and the friend's autonomy was disrespected. The answer is likely A.\n"
