At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl talking explicitly about her sexual activities, including losing her virginity at 13, to her friend. The friend then told the girl's mom, who is also a teacher. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the trust between friends. By sharing such personal details, the girl likely expected confidentiality. The friend broke that trust by informing her mom. Even if the motive was concern, sharing private information without consent is a breach of trust.\n\nNext, the age factor. Both are minors, 15 years old. In many places, the age of consent might be higher, so the girl's actions could be legally questionable. However, the friend's role here is about confidentiality versus parental responsibility. But the friend isn't a legal guardian, so they might not have the authority to make that decision.\n\nThen, the mother's reaction: initially doubting, then believing. The friend might have thought they were doing the right thing by informing the parent, but the fallout was the loss of a friendship. The question is whether the friend overstepped by sharing such personal information without consent, even if it was out of concern.\n\nAlso, the friend mentioned trying to see it from the mother's perspective. But the mother might have preferred to address it directly with her daughter, not through a third party. The friend didn't consult the mother first, which could be seen as presumptuous.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend violated the trust, which is a significant issue. Even if the intention was good, the action caused harm to the friendship. So the answer leans towards the friend being in the wrong (A). However, there's a nuance because the mother is also a teacher, so there might be a legal duty to report certain things. But since the girl was 15 and had sex at 13, that could be a legal issue. However, the friend isn't a legal authority. The main issue here is the breach of trust without considering the mother's right to handle it herself. So the answer is A.\n"
