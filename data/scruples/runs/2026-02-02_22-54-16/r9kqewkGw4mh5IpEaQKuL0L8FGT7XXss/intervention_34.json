At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who snitched on their friend is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who's sharing explicit details about her sexual activities with her friend, who is also a 15-year-old. The friend then tells the girl's mother, who is also a teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age aspect. Both the friend and the person who told are minors, 15 years old. In many places, the legal age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is sleeping around at 15, there might be legal implications. But the main question here is about moral wrongdoing, not legal.\n\nThe friend shared personal information with her friend, trusting her. The friend then decides to inform the mother, thinking about the mother's perspective. The user's reasoning here is that they wanted to protect the mother's interests, but did they overstep?\n\nConfidentiality is important in friendships. If the girl told her friend in confidence, then sharing that information without permission breaches that trust. However, the friend might argue that the information could affect the girl's well-being or safety. But in this case, the friend is sleeping with others, which isn't necessarily harmful unless there's illegal activity or coercion. The friend mentions losing virginity at 13, which is under the age of consent in many places, so that could be a concern. However, the friend who told might not have considered whether the girl was being manipulated or if there were legal issues, but instead acted based on their own judgment.\n\nAnother angle: the person who told is a minor, so maybe they don't fully understand the consequences. They might have felt responsible as a friend to inform the parent because they thought the parent should know. But is that their role? The mother is a teacher, which adds another layer. The mother might have a responsibility to know about her daughter's activities if they affect school environment or behavior, but the friend isn't in a position to judge that.\n\nThe key points are: breach of trust, potential legal issues if the girl is under age for certain activities, and the right to privacy. The friend shared private information without consent. Even if the intention was to protect the mother, the method was a violation of trust. The result was that the friend is upset and the friendship ended. So, even if the person thought they were doing the right thing, the act of snitching without a clear justification (like legal issues) is likely wrong.\n\nBut wait, what if the mother is a teacher? If the mother, as a teacher, noticed changes in the student's behavior, perhaps the friend had a duty to report? However, the friend isn't a teacher or authority figure. They don't have the responsibility to monitor their friend's personal life. The friend's actions were based on their own perspective, not an official duty. So the friend's decision to share personal details goes beyond their role.\n\nAlso, the girl in question might not be aware that her actions are problematic. The friend who told might have thought it's their parent's right to know, but the daughter's autonomy is also a factor. Unless there's immediate harm, parents might not have the right to know every detail of their child's private life, especially if the child is a minor but capable of making decisions. However, the age of 13 for losing virginity might be a red flag, but the friend's role isn't to police that.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intentions might have been to inform the parent, the act of sharing confidential information without consent breaches trust. The friend's autonomy and privacy are important, and the person who told overstepped by not respecting that confidentiality. Even if the parent found out, the method of disclosure through the friend is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
