At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit-style post) is wrong for informing their friend's mom about her sexual activities. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is 15, same age as the author. She's sharing explicit details about her relationships and sleeping around. The author decides to tell her mom, who is also a teacher. The friend now refuses to talk to the author.\n\nThe key points here are privacy, trust, and the age aspect. At 15, both are minors, and their parents are legally responsible for their decisions. However, the author took it upon themselves to share private information without consent. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing by considering the mother's perspective, sharing such personal details could be a breach of trust. \n\nIn many cases, friends expect confidentiality unless there's a legal requirement or immediate harm involved. The friend's behavior might be considered reckless, but that doesn't justify the author snitching. The mother might have a right to know if there's illegal activity or underage sex, but the situation here seems more about the mother's authority. The author's action likely caused a breakdown in friendship and might have violated the friend's privacy. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned the friend lost her virginity at 13. Depending on the jurisdiction, this could be a legal issue if there's an age of consent lower than 15, but since the friend is 15 now, that's past. However, the author's responsibility here is questionable. They might have thought they were protecting the mother, but the method was invasive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably acted wrongly by sharing private information without the friend's consent, leading to the friend's anger and the loss of the friendship. The answer is likely A.\n"
