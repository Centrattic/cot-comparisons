At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 15-year-old guy, had a friend (also 15) who was talking about sleeping around a lot. The friend mentioned losing her virginity at 13 and details about her relationships and hookups. The author then told her mom, who is also his teacher, all these details. Now, the friend is upset and doesn't want to talk to him anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is a minor, so her mom might have a right to know about her child's actions, especially if there are legal or safety concerns. However, the author is also a minor, so his judgment might not be fully mature. The friend shared personal information with the author, which he then disclosed to an adult. \n\nConfidentiality is a big part here. When someone shares personal details, especially in a friendship, there's an expectation of trust. By revealing that information to the friend's mother, the author might have broken that trust. But the mom is also a parent and a teacher, so maybe she has a duty to be informed if her child is engaging in risky behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the age of consent. If the friend lost her virginity at 13, in many places, that could be legally problematic if the other person is significantly older. The author might have thought he was doing the right thing by reporting this, but he could have approached it differently. For example, talking to a trusted adult first or the school counselor instead of the mom directly, especially since the mom is also a teacher involved in the situation.\n\nThe author's motivation is important. He said he thought from the mom's perspective and wanted to inform her. But was it his place to do so without considering the friend's autonomy or the potential consequences? The friend might feel betrayed, and the author's action led to the loss of their friendship.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, as a 15-year-old, the author's understanding of the situation might be limited. However, he still made a choice to share private information. The key question is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. While the parent might have a right to know, the method and the fact that the information was shared in confidence could tip the balance.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: breach of trust, the parent's right to know, the potential legal issues, and the impact on the friendship. It's a tough call. Some might say the author was trying to be a good person by informing the mom, but others would say he violated the friend's privacy without considering the consequences. In many cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent is seen as a breach of trust, even if the intent was to help. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because he didn't respect the friend's privacy, even if his intentions were good.\n"
