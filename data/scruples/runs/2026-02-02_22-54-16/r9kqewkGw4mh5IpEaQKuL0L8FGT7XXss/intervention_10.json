At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for snitching on their friend. The situation is that a 15-year-old girl shared explicit details about her sexual activities with the author, who is also 15. The author then told the girl's mother, who's also their teacher, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was talking about her relationships and losing her virginity at 13. The author decided to inform the mother because they thought the mother would want to know. Now the friend is upset and no longer talks to the author.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is the asshole (Answer A) or not (Answer B).\n\nFrom a general ethics perspective, sharing someone's private information without consent is usually a breach of trust, which can be problematic. Even if the author thought it was for the mother's sake, they didn't ask the friend first. The friend might have considered those details private and not meant to be shared with adults, especially her mother. \n\nHowever, the author is a minor (15 years old), and in some cases, minors might be expected to inform adults if there's a concern about underage sexual activity. But in this case, the mother is already aware that the daughter is 15 and has been in relationships, so maybe the author's intention was to help. But the method of sharing explicit details might have been too harsh or unnecessary. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is significant. The author lost a friend over this, which indicates that the friend valued her privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, the act of snitching without considering the friend's wishes could be seen as wrong. The mother being a teacher might have a duty to know if there's something concerning, but the author didn't approach a teacher first for guidance, just went straight to the mother. \n\nSo, the key points are: breach of confidentiality, the age of the individuals, and the consequences on the friendship. While the author might have thought they were doing the right thing, the action of sharing private information without consent is generally considered wrong, even if the intent is to help. The friend's privacy and autonomy should be respected unless there's a legal obligation to report something harmful, which the situation here doesn't clearly state. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
