At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend's mom about her sleeping around is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the friend (a 15-year-old girl) shared personal details about her sexual activity with the author. The author, also 15, then told the mother (who's a teacher) about it. Now the friend is upset and won't talk to the author anymore.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here. The friend confided in the author, sharing private information. The author decided to pass that information to the mother. The author's reasoning was that if they were in the mother's position, they'd want to know. But the friend didn't ask the author to keep it secret, but sharing such personal details with a parent might be a breach of trust. \n\nBut wait, the friend is a minor, right? Both are 15. So the parent might have a right to know if there's something concerning happening. However, the author is also a minor. Should they be the one to report? Maybe the teacher (the mom) should have been informed by someone else if there was a concern. But the author did it themselves. \n\nAlso, the friend is talking about losing her virginity at 13, which might be a legal issue depending on the country. But the author isn't a legal authority, so they might not be the right person to report that. \n\nThe problem here is the breach of trust. The friend shared personal info expecting confidentiality, and the author broke that trust. Even if the author's intention was to protect the friend or the mother, the action of sharing without consent violates the friend's privacy. \n\nSo even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, the act of snitching without the friend's permission is a problem. The friend might not have wanted her mom to know. The author didn't consider the friend's wishes or discuss it with her first. \n\nTherefore, the author is probably in the wrong because they broke trust. The right approach might have been to talk to the friend about their concerns or maybe involve a trusted adult without revealing the friend's secrets. \n\nSo the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
