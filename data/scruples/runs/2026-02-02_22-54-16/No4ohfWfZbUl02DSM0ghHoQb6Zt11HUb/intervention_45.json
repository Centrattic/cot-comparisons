She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author came out as gay, faced a negative reaction from their mother, including religious rejection and being cut off. The mother is described as having friends who are gay, but the author believes their mom views those friends as sinners. The author, feeling hurt and powerless, reached out to those friends to inform them about their mom's homophobia.\n\nThe question is about whether the author's action was wrong. The key points here are the intent and the impact. The author was upset and felt they needed to stand up for themselves, even if it was a form of retaliation. They wanted to inform their mom's friends about her homophobia, which could be seen as a way of protecting themselves or those friends from future judgment.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. On one hand, the author might have been acting out of anger and without considering the consequences, which could be seen as vindictive. On the other hand, they were trying to be honest with the friends about their mother's stance, which might be seen as a form of transparency, especially if those friends are unaware of her true feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of confidentiality and respect. Did the author have the right to share their mother's private beliefs with others? That's a grey area. However, given the context of the mother being a homophobe and the author feeling wronged, some might argue it's justified to inform others who might be affected by her behavior.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the community often considers the intent and the aftermath. If the author's action was a direct response to personal harm and not malicious, some might argue they're not the asshole. But others might say they overstepped by spreading their mother's views without her consent.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were acting under emotional distress and the intention was to inform people who might be affected by their mother's behavior, even if the method was questionable.\n"
