She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they came out as gay to their mom, who had a bad reaction, being religious and disapproving. The mom stopped talking to them and the author felt hurt and powerless. Then, the author messaged their mom's gay friends, telling them that their mom is a homophobe. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a lot of emotional pain after coming out and facing rejection. They might have been acting out of hurt and anger. On the other hand, the mom's friends are also part of the LGBTQ+ community, and the author shared personal family issues with them. \n\nIs it okay to share someone else's private behavior, even if it's negative? The author didn't just talk about their mom's beliefs in general but revealed specific instances where the mom expressed homophobia. That could be seen as a breach of privacy. Even though the mom's friends are gay, they might not be okay with being told about their friend's private actions without her consent. \n\nAlso, the author's mom might not have known that her friends were being told about her views. This could damage the mom's relationships with her friends, who might feel betrayed if the author shared without permission. The author's intention was to warn the friends about their homophobe friend, but is it their place to do that? Maybe they should have handled it differently, like seeking support elsewhere instead of informing the friends.\n\nHowever, the author could argue that they were in a vulnerable state and acting out of frustration. They might not have intended to spread gossip but wanted to connect with others who were in similar situations. The friends might appreciate knowing about their friend's true feelings, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, sharing someone else's private views without their consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the situation. The author might have a valid reason, but the action itself breaches trust and privacy. There's also the aspect of the author's mom's right to her beliefs, even if they're harmful. The author has the right to be upset, but spreading that information to others might not be the right approach.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the mom's actions are definitely harmful, but the author's response could be seen as harmful too. The author might need to take responsibility for violating their mom's privacy, even if the mom was wrong. So, considering all that, the answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong for sharing their mom's private behavior with others without consent.\n"
