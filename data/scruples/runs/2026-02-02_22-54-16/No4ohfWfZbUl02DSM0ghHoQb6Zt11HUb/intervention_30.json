She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who came out to their mom is in the wrong for telling her gay friends about the mom's rejection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The mom rejected her son when he came out as gay, being religious and implying they'd go to hell. The son, hurt and upset, contacted his mom's gay friends to inform them about her attitude. \n\nSo, the son's action was to warn or inform his mom's friends about her homophobia. The question is, is the son in the wrong for doing that? \n\nFrom one angle, the son was hurt and wanted to protect his mom's friends from her judgmental behavior. But sharing someone's private comments about their beliefs, especially in a hurtful state, might be crossing a line. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's friends had no idea about her stance. The son might have felt justified in wanting to protect them from similar treatment. But is it right to share private information without consent, even if the intent is good?\n\nI think intent matters, but so does the action. The son was in emotional distress and acted out of anger. That might mitigate some responsibility, but sharing personal family issues with others can be a breach of confidentiality. \n\nHowever, the mom's behavior is problematic too. If she's being homophobic, maybe the son felt the need to speak up. But again, the son is sharing private family matters with others. \n\nI'm torn. The son's actions are hurtful, but the mom's initial rejection is also wrong. The key is whether the son acted appropriately. Since he shared his mom's private comments without her consent, even if it's to protect others, it's probably a breach of trust. So maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that he had a right to protect his friends from similar treatment. Still, the method of communication might be unwise. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. \n\nHmm. I think the answer here is that the son is partially in the wrong because he shared private information without consent, even if the motive was to protect others. So answer A.\n"
