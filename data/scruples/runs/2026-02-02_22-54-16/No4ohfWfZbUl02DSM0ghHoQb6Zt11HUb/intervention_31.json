She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out as gay. The mom is religious, didn't take it well, and hasn't been responding. The author felt hurt and powerless, so they messaged a couple of the mom's gay friends, explaining the situation and calling the mom a homophobe.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author was going through a tough time. Coming out and facing rejection from family can be really painful. They might have felt like they had no one else to talk to, especially since their parents aren't supporting them. The friends they told are part of a group (the mom's friends) who are actually part of the same community that the mom is criticizing. The author might have wanted to warn them about the mom's stance, maybe so the friends could make informed decisions about their relationship with her.\n\nBut on the other hand, spreading personal family issues to others without consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the friends are gay, the author is sharing their mother's private reaction without her knowledge. It's possible that the friends might be hurt or uncomfortable if they find out this way. Also, the author did this out of anger and hurt, which might not be the best time to make decisions. \n\nBut considering the context, the author was in a vulnerable state. They might have felt justified in wanting to protect others from their mother's prejudice. However, there's a line between standing up for oneself and sharing someone else's private information. The friends are part of the mom's social circle, so maybe the author thought it was relevant to their relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. If the friends were already aware of the mom's views through other means, maybe the author isn't doing much harm. But if they're being told this information directly by someone else, it could be seen as the author taking matters into their own hands. However, given the mom's own hypocrisy (supporting gay friends while being homophobic), the friends might appreciate knowing the truth. \n\nI think the key points are the author's intent and the relationship with the friends. If the friends are close to the author, maybe it's different. But since they're the mom's friends, the author might have overstepped. Still, the author's actions were a reaction to being hurt, which adds complexity. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were acting out of pain and wanted to protect others from their mom's harmful beliefs. But there's a gray area here. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, but in the moment, it's understandable. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
