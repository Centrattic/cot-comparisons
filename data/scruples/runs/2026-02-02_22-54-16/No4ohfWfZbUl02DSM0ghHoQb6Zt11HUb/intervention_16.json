She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who came out to their mom and then told her gay friends about the mom's rejection is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the mom's reaction: she's religious, told the child they'd go to Hell, expressed disappointment, refuses to accept their partner. That's pretty harsh and harmful. The child is hurt and feels powerless. They reach out to the mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's rejection and her homophobia. The child's intent was probably to share their pain and maybe also to inform the friends about the mom's stance, given she's part of the dog show community with them.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. \n\nOn one hand, sharing personal family issues with others might be seen as oversharing or breaching privacy. The mom might see it as the child spreading family drama or judging her to others. But on the other hand, the mom's behavior was harmful and the child was in emotional distress. They might not have known how else to cope. The friends in question are part of a marginalized group that the mom disapproves of, so there's a conflict there. The child's action could be seen as defending their own identity and perhaps trying to protect the friends from the mom's negative beliefs, or at least being honest about her stance.\n\nBut was the child justified in sharing this with her friends? It's a gray area. While the mom's actions were hurtful, the child's response could be seen as airing family matters publicly, which might not be appropriate. However, given the context of being in emotional pain and the mother's intolerance, the child's action might be more about seeking support or validation. \n\nI think the key is intent. If the child wanted to inform the friends about the mom's true beliefs to protect them or warn them, maybe that's different. But if it's just venting without considering the consequences, maybe that's inconsiderate. However, considering the mom's history of homophobia, the child might have felt it was necessary to be honest, especially if the friends are unaware of her true stance. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no clear answer. But given the circumstances, the child's action might be more about self-expression and sharing their experience rather than malicious intent. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the child shouldn't have shared personal family issues without the mom's consent, regardless of the situation. But given the mom's harmful behavior, the child's action might be more forgivable. \n\nI think the answer is B. The person is not in the wrong because the mother's actions were problematic, and the child was acting from a place of hurt and possibly trying to connect with others who might be affected by the mother's views.\n"
