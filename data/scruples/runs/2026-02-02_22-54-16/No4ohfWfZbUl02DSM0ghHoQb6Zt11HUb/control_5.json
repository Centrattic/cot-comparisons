She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author came out as gay to their mom, who reacted poorly, saying they'd go to hell and that she's disappointed. She's not accepting and hasn't been contacting them. The author felt hurt and powerless. Then, the author messaged the mom's gay friends, telling them about the mom's homophobia. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons behind the action. The author was upset and felt powerless. They might have acted out of hurt and a desire to protect others from their mom's views. On the other hand, spreading information about someone's beliefs without their consent could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the mom didn't want her views known. \n\nThe mom's friends are gay, and she already knows they're her friends. The author might have thought it was right to inform them about the mom's stance, but did they have the right to do that? The author's intention was partly to protect the friends from the mom's homophobia by letting them know. However, the author might not have considered that the mom might not want her private beliefs shared, even if they're negative. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to expose someone's negative views without their permission? It's a form of gossip or sharing personal information that could damage relationships. The author's mom might have a right to privacy regarding her opinions, even if those opinions are harmful. The friends could have already known her views through other means, but the author took it upon themselves to disclose it in a personal message. \n\nAlso, the author's emotional state at the time might affect their judgment. They were in tears and angry, which could lead to impulsive decisions they later regret. However, that doesn't necessarily excuse the action. \n\nAnother angle is the potential harm. If the mom's friends found out through the author instead of directly from the mom, it could strain those relationships. The friends might feel betrayed if they discover the information came from the author's child rather than the mom herself. \n\nOn the flip side, the friends are part of the LGBTQ+ community, which the mom is judgmental about. The author might feel that protecting their friends from the mom's harmful beliefs is justified. But is it their place to do so? Maybe the author should have addressed it with the mom first or found another way to support their friends without disclosing the mom's views.\n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private information, even if you disagree with it, can be seen as a violation of trust. Unless there's a direct threat, it's usually considered better to let people handle their own issues. The author might have overstepped by acting as a messenger between their mom and her friends without consulting her first.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action probably crosses a line. While their intentions were to protect their friends and express their own hurt, sharing their mom's private beliefs without her consent is a breach of privacy and trust. Therefore, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
