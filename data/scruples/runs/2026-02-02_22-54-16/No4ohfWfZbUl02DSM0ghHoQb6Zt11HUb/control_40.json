She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, saying they'd go to hell and was disappointed. The mom isn't responding anymore. The author, feeling hurt and powerless, messaged their mom's gay friends, informing them about their mom's homophobia. The question is whether the author did something wrong by doing that.\n\nSo, breaking it down. The author's mom is a homophobe, which is bad. The author is upset, so they reach out to the mom's friends (who are gay) to warn them about their friend's views. The author's intention might be to share their experience, but the action is sharing private family issues with others without the mom's consent.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't ask their mom's permission to talk to her friends. They shared personal family matters, which could be seen as spreading gossip or violating privacy. Even if the mom's behavior is problematic, the author is sharing that information with others who might not be directly involved. \n\nOn one hand, the mom is being homophobic, which is definitely wrong. But on the other hand, the author is sharing personal family issues without considering their mom's privacy. The friends might not have been informed about their friend's views, but does the author have the right to disclose that information?\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's emotional state. They were upset and maybe acted in the moment. But even in that case, sharing private family matters with others could be seen as crossing a line. The friends might not appreciate being informed about their friend's private behavior, especially in a way that could damage the relationship between the mom and her friends.\n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to protect the friends from being in a situation where they might be judged, but is it their place to do that? The friends might have their own way of dealing with their friend's homophobia. The author stepping in could lead to unintended consequences, like the mom's friends feeling targeted or the mom being further upset.\n\nIn terms of morality, while the mom is in the wrong for being homophobic, the author's action of sharing personal information without consent might be considered a breach of trust. The author could be seen as taking revenge or seeking support, but it's a private matter. Publicly or privately sharing that information with others without consent is part of the issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private family information without consent, even if the mom's behavior was problematic. The author's action is a breach of privacy, regardless of the motivation.\n"
