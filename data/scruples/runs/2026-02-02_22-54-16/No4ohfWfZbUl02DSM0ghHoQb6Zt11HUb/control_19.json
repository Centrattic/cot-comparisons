She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The mom is religious, didn't take the coming out well, and the author felt hurt and powerless. In response, the author messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author is sharing personal family information with others. The mom didn't return calls, so the author was upset. But is it right to go behind someone's back and inform their friends about their negative reaction to a child coming out?\n\nOn one hand, the author was hurt and wanted to warn the friends about their mom's views. The friends might not have known the mom's true feelings. The author might feel justified in protecting their own well-being and that of potential future relationships. However, sharing such personal information without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. The mom's right to privacy versus the author's emotional state and safety.\n\nAlso, the author's mom is friends with gay people but holds negative beliefs. The author's action might be seen as confronting the friends about the mom's hypocrisy. But again, is it the author's place to do that? The friends might feel uncomfortable if they learn about their friend's stance from the author instead of the mom herself.\n\nThe author's intent matters. They were upset and acting out of anger. The action could be seen as retaliation or a way to cope, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. It's about respecting boundaries. The mom's friends have a relationship with her, not the author. The author might not have the authority to disclose that information.\n\nIn terms of ethics, privacy is a big factor. The author is sharing sensitive family matters without the mom's consent. Even if the mom is being harmful, the author's action could be considered a violation of trust. The friends might have their own relationship with the mom, and the author's message could damage that. The author might be trying to protect themselves, but the method was inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's reaction is inexcusable. She's rejecting her child and spreading harmful beliefs. The author is left in a vulnerable position. However, the appropriate way to handle it would be to seek support elsewhere without involving the mom's friends. Maybe they should have talked to a counselor, a support group, or a trusted adult instead of informing the friends directly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are understandable, the action of sharing personal family issues with the mom's friends without consent is likely crossing a boundary. The answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't respect their mom's privacy and potentially harmed relationships the mom has with others.\n"
