She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out. The author's mom is religious, didn't accept them, and is now cutting off contact. The author sent a message to her friends, explaining their mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was hurt and felt powerless after being rejected by their mother. They were in tears and acting out of emotional distress. The mom has friends who are gay, and the author wanted to inform them about the mom's views. The author's intention might have been to warn the friends or maybe to get support, but it could also be seen as sharing private family matters without consent.\n\nNow, the key points here are intent and consequences. The author's mom's friends were already aware that their friend (the mom) is religious and might hold certain views. But the author is exposing the mom's private reaction to a family member. Even though the mom's friends are gay, does the author have the right to share that information without the mom's consent?\n\nThere's a conflict here between the author's emotional state and the ethical responsibility to keep family matters private. The author might feel justified because of the mom's treatment, but sharing this with others could damage the mom's relationships and reputation. However, the mom's behavior is also problematic as she's rejecting her child for being gay.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if someone is hurt, spreading personal information about a family member without their consent can be seen as a breach of privacy. But there's also the aspect of defending oneself against homophobia. The situation is complicated because the mom's actions are harmful, but the author's solution might not be the most appropriate.\n\nThe Reddit community often considers both sides. They might empathize with the author's pain but also question the action of informing the mother's friends. The author might have other options, like seeking support elsewhere or setting boundaries without involving others. However, in moments of emotional distress, people might not think clearly and act on impulse.\n\nI think the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they shared personal information without consent, even if the mom is at fault. But others might argue that the author was standing up for themselves in a situation where they felt unsupported. It's a tough call, but the act of sharing private family issues without consent is typically seen as crossing a line, regardless of the reason.\n"
