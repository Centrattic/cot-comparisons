She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who reacted negatively, being religious and saying they'd go to hell. The mom stopped communicating. The author then told the mom's gay friends about the rejection, explaining the mom's homophobia. The author is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mom is a homophobe, the author is upset, and they shared this information with the mom's friends. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nI should consider the ethics of sharing someone's private behavior, even if it's negative. The author is exposing their mother's views to her friends, which could damage the mother's reputation. On one hand, the mom's actions are harmful and discriminatory. On the other hand, sharing such information without consent might be considered a breach of privacy or trust.\n\nThe author's intent was to inform the friends about their friend's true nature, possibly to protect the friends from being hurt or to align with the author's own feelings of betrayal. However, is it justifiable to out someone's private beliefs, even if those beliefs are harmful? There's a balance between defending oneself and respecting others' privacy.\n\nAlso, the author's mom has a right to her beliefs, even if they're wrong. The author's action might be seen as spreading gossip or violating confidentiality. But the friends might have a right to know if the mother's actions are hypocritical, given that the friends are part of a marginalized group. However, the author didn't ask for permission or check with the friends first; they just told them directly.\n\nAnother angle: the author was in a vulnerable state, so their judgment might have been clouded. But that doesn't necessarily excuse the action. The friends could feel uncomfortable or pressured, especially if they didn't want to confront the mom about her beliefs.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's behavior is undeniably problematic, the author's decision to share this information without considering the consequences might be seen as in the wrong. It's a gray area, but generally, sharing someone's private views without consent can be harmful, even if the intent is to expose hypocrisy. So the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
