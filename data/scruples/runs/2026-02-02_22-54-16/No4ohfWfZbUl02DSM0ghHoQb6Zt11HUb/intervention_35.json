She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out as gay. The mom is religious and didn't accept them, leading to the author feeling hurt and isolated. The author then reached out to the mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a vulnerable state, upset after a negative reaction from their mom. They acted out of emotional distress, possibly lashing out as a way to cope. The mom's friends, being part of the LGBTQ+ community, might have felt targeted or concerned about their friend's behavior. \n\nBut was the action justified? On one hand, the author might argue they were protecting themselves and sharing the truth to warn others about the mom's intolerance. On the other hand, sharing personal family matters without consent could be seen as violating privacy. However, given the mom's behavior and the author's emotional state, it's a complex situation.\n\nThe author's intent was to inform others about the mom's stance, which could prevent others from being blindsided. But did they have the right to do so? Privacy is a factor here. However, in cases of discrimination or harmful behavior, some might argue that sharing such information is justified to protect oneself and others. \n\nThe key points are the mom's homophobia, the author's emotional reaction, and the potential impact on the friends. The author didn't directly attack the friends but shared the mom's views, which might be seen as transparency rather than gossip. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's action, while impulsive, was a response to being hurt and seeking support. The friends might have the right to know if their friend's actions are discriminatory. The author isn't in the wrong because their action was a reaction to being rejected and wanting to inform others about the mom's intolerance. So the answer is B.\n"
