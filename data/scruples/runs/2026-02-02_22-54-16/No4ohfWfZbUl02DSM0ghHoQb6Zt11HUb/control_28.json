She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. The mom is religious, didn't accept the author's sexuality, and now the author told some of her friends about the rejection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was hurt and angry after coming out and being rejected. They reached out to their mom's gay friends, friends that the mom herself knows, to inform them that she's a homophobe. The author's intention was to warn these friends and maybe also get some support, but in a way that could be seen as spreading negative information about their mom.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author have the right to share this information? Is there a right to privacy here? The author is sharing personal family matters with people who are friends of their parent. Even if the author is upset, sharing this information could be seen as violating their mother's privacy or possibly damaging her relationships. The author might have thought they were protecting themselves or seeking solidarity, but by informing their mother's friends, they might be acting out of anger rather than a constructive approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a vulnerable position, facing rejection from family. They might feel justified in wanting to protect themselves or their future partner from similar rejection. The friends in question are also part of an LGBTQ+ community, so they might understand the author's perspective. However, the act of informing them without the mother's consent could be seen as spreading gossip or sharing personal family issues, which is generally frowned upon unless it's to protect someone from harm.\n\nAnother angle: Was there any direct harm to the friends? If the friends already knew their friend (the mother) is religious, but perhaps didn't know the extent of her homophobia. By sharing this, the author might be helping the friends make informed decisions about their relationship with their friend. But still, the method of sharing could be problematic because it's a personal family issue being shared without consent.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. Even in emotional distress, sharing such information isn't typically considered acceptable. The author could have sought support elsewhere, like friends or support groups, instead of involving their mother's friends. The act might also harm the author's relationship with their parents further and could be seen as a betrayal of trust if the mother expected the conversation to remain private.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions stem from hurt and a desire to be understood, sharing personal family drama with friends without consent is generally considered an overreach. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
