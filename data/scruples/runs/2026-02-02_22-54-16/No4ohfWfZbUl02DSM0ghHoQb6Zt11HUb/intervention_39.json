She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay to their mom and then told her gay friends about her negative reaction is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the mom reacted poorly, was religious, and rejected her child. The kid felt hurt and powerless. Then, in anger, they messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the mom's behavior is clearly harmful and wrong. The child is dealing with emotional pain and rejection. The action taken was to inform the mother's friends about her views, which could be seen as sharing private family matters. But the friends are also part of the community being judged. The author might be trying to protect the friends from the mom's hypocrisy or to support others in similar situations.\n\nBut is it the author's place to do that? They didn't ask the mom's permission. It's possible the mom's friends might not have known about her stance, but the author is sharing personal family issues publicly. Even if the message was a reaction to being hurt, sharing someone's private beliefs (especially negative ones) without consent can be problematic. The mom might be embarrassed or face social consequences, which the author might not have considered. However, the mom's actions are also harmful, and the friends are in a similar situation. Maybe the author is trying to create a support network.\n\nThe key points are intent and harm. The author's intent was to inform friends about the mom's true beliefs, which could help them make informed decisions about their friendship. However, it might also violate the family's privacy. The author's emotional state at the time (tears, anger) suggests it was an impulsive act. But in terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong because the mom's actions are the root of the problem. But from another angle, sharing private matters isn't appropriate regardless of the motive. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were acting on hurt and trying to find support, but there's a valid argument for the other side. The answer depends on the community's stance on privacy versus support.\n"
