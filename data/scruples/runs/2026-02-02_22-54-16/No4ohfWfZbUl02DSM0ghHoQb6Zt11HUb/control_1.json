She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. The situation is that the author came out as gay, faced a negative reaction from their mom, and then told the mom's gay friends about her homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author is hurt and feeling wronged. They might feel justified in wanting to share the truth about their mom's beliefs, especially if those friends are part of a community that the mom claims to support but actually discriminates against. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't ask their mother's permission or even consider her perspective. Spreading personal family matters, especially negative ones, can be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the mom is being harmful, the author might have a responsibility to respect their mother's privacy unless there's a serious harm to the friends involved.\n\nAlso, the author's actions were done in a moment of emotional distress. They might not have thought through the consequences. However, that doesn't necessarily make it right, but it could be a mitigating factor. The friends might have felt betrayed if they found out their friend's views were shared without consent. \n\nAnother angle is whether the friends were already aware of the mother's stance. If they weren't, the author is informing them, which could protect them from potential future harm. But if the author is the one who revealed it, it could create tension or conflict in the mother's social circle without her knowing the source.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's primary issue is the breach of privacy. Even if the mother's views are problematic, sharing that information without her consent could be seen as the author overstepping. The author might need to take responsibility for their actions, but whether they are \"in the wrong\" depends on the context. Since the friends are gay and the mother is a homophobe, there's a case to be made that the author is protecting others from a harmful individual. However, typically, sharing personal family issues without consent is considered a breach, so the author might be at fault.\n\nI think the key here is the violation of privacy. Even if the intent was to protect others, the method of doing so without the mother's consent is where the issue lies. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
