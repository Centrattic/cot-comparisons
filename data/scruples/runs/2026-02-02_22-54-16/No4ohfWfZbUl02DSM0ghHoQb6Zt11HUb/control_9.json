She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The author came out to their mom, who was very negative, religious, and said they'd go to hell. The mom also stopped communicating with the author. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the author's intent and the impact of their actions. The author was hurt and upset, and they reached out to their mom's friends, sharing personal information about the mom's beliefs. The friends are gay, and the mom is friends with them despite her beliefs. The author might have thought this was a way to confront the mom's hypocrisy, but did they overstep?\n\nOn one hand, the author was in a vulnerable state and did something out of anger or hurt. But sharing someone's personal conduct, especially in a negative light, without their consent can be problematic. The mom's friends might have a right to know the truth if they're close friends, but does that justify the author's action? The author's message was about their mom's intolerance, which could be seen as a form of betrayal. However, the friends are also part of a community that the mom claims to be friends with, so maybe the author felt it was a way to hold the mom accountable.\n\nBut in terms of ethics, is it right to disclose someone's private behavior without their consent? Even if the motive is to inform others about the mom's hypocrisy, the author is using their own pain as a reason to do so. It's possible that the author violated their mom's privacy, even if the mom's actions were hurtful. The friends might have their own relationship with the mom, and the author stepping in like that could damage that relationship without the friends' consent.\n\nAlso, the author's action might not be the best way to handle their own feelings. They might have wanted support, but taking it out on their mom's friends could be harmful. The friends might be upset that the author shared personal family issues, especially if it's critical of their friend. So, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information without considering the consequences to others or the privacy of their mom.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). They acted out of hurt but crossed a line by sharing their mom's behavior without her consent, potentially harming relationships and violating privacy.\n"
