She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that the mom rejected them after coming out. The mom is religious and didn't accept them, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was hurt and upset after being rejected, which might explain why they shared their mother's stance with her friends. The friends are also gay, so they might be in a similar situation where the mom disapproves. The author's message included the mom's negative views, which could be seen as a betrayal or a way to hold the mom accountable.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified in sharing the truth, especially if they believe the mom's friends should know about her hypocrisy. The mom claims she wouldn't say anything to them but has those views. The author's action could be seen as a way to confront that inconsistency.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing personal family issues without the mom's consent might breach privacy. The friends might not want to be involved in the family drama, and the author's message could cause tension or harm the relationship between the mom and her friends. The author might have crossed a line by involving third parties in their personal conflict.\n\nEmotional state is a factor. The author was in tears and angry, which might affect their judgment. However, that doesn't necessarily excuse the action. There's a balance between self-advocacy and respecting others' privacy.\n\nConsidering the intent: the author wanted to inform the friends about their friend's true beliefs, possibly to protect the friends if they're unaware. But is it their place to do so? Alternatively, maybe the author should have addressed it with their mom first or sought support elsewhere instead of sharing with friends.\n\nThe community's perspective might vary. Some might see it as justified given the mom's rejection and hypocrisy. Others might think the author should have handled it differently. The key points are intent, impact, and the breach of privacy.\n\nSo, if the answer is A (author is wrong), it's because they violated their mom's privacy. If B (not wrong), it's about accountability and the mom's hypocrisy. I need to decide based on the situation's nuances.\n"
