She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person came out as gay to their mom, and the mom reacted negatively, calling them to hell and disowning them. The mom and dad aren't returning calls. The person is hurt and upset. Then, in the heat of their anger and tears, they messaged their mom's gay friends (who are also part of dog shows, so same community) and told them that their friend (mom) is a homophobe. The mom is supposed to be friends with these gay couples, but the person is saying that the mom actually thinks their lifestyle is wrong. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for informing these friends about their mom's true feelings.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want others' opinions. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: the mom is part of a community that includes LGBTQ+ people, but she's a homophobe despite that. The person, feeling powerless and hurt, decides to reach out to these friends to \"let them know what kind of person their friend was.\" The act is essentially outing the mom as a homophobe to her friends, which might be considered a breach of trust or privacy.\n\nNow, considering the moral and ethical aspects. On one hand, the mom had a harmful reaction, and the person might feel justified in wanting to protect others from similar treatment. The mom's friends are part of the community she claims to be part of, so the person might think they deserve to know the truth. However, on the other hand, the person didn't ask for permission to share this information. They shared it out of anger and hurt, which could be seen as using their friends as a way to retaliate or get back at their mom.\n\nIs the person in the wrong for sharing confidential family matters without consent? The mom's beliefs and reactions are part of her private life, and the person is sharing that with others. Even if the mom is a homophobe, spreading that information without her consent could be considered a violation of privacy. However, the person's intent might be protective\u2014if the friends were unaware of her true feelings, they might not have known that their friend is a homophobe despite being part of the community. \n\nBut the key issue here is whether the person overstepped by sharing their mom's private stance without her knowledge. Even if the mom is at fault, the act of informing others without her consent could be seen as gossiping or betraying trust. The person might argue that they're protecting others from the mom's behavior, but the mom's friends have the right to know, so maybe it's in the friends' interest. However, the person isn't the mom's friend; they're the child. So the mom's relationships with her friends are separate. The person's role is to protect their own well-being, but sharing that information publicly might have consequences for the mom's relationships.\n\nAnother angle: the person is acting out of hurt and anger, which might reduce the severity of the action in terms of intent. If they were trying to help the friends avoid similar experiences, that's a different motive than just being spiteful. However, the act itself is still sharing personal information without consent, which is typically considered wrong unless there's a compelling reason like protecting someone from harm. In this case, the friends might not be in danger, but their social relationship with the mom might be affected. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author's action is a breach of confidentiality. Even if the mom is a homophobe, the author is the one who shared the information. So from a strict standpoint, the author is in the wrong because they didn't have the right to disclose their mother's private beliefs. However, some might argue that the mother's behavior is worse, and the author's action was a form of self-defense or protecting others. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. If the author shared the information without consent, regardless of intent, they did something wrong. The mom's being a homophobe doesn't absolve the author of responsibility for sharing that information. However, if the author's intention was to protect others, maybe the wrongdoing is less severe. But the act still violates privacy. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because they shared their mother's private stance without her consent, which is a breach of trust and privacy. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's action crosses a line by disclosing information that belongs to their mother.\n"
