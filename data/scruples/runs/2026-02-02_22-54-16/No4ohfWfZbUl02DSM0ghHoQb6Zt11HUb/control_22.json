She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who had a very negative reaction, even calling them out for going to Hell and disowning them. The author then told their mom's gay friends about her homophobia.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the mom rejected the author for being gay, which is hurtful. The author, feeling hurt and maybe seeking some form of support or confrontation, shared their mom's views with her friends. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's behavior is clearly harmful and discriminatory. The author is dealing with a lot of emotional pain. When someone is hurt, their actions might be impulsive. But does that justify telling others about someone's private views? \n\nThe author sent a message to their mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's rejection. The mom already knows the couple exists, so they're connected. But by informing the friends about her mom's stance, the author might be exposing the mom's personal beliefs, which could lead to social consequences. The mom might face ostracization from her friends, which is a form of public shaming. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, the mom's behavior is unacceptable. On the other, the author took it upon themselves to inform her friends without her consent. Even if the author was upset, sharing someone else's private views without their permission could be seen as a breach of confidentiality. But maybe there's a justification here because the mom was being hypocritical, given she has gay friends but is homophobic. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe reaching out to the friends privately to address the mom's behavior, but directly telling them might be crossing a line. Also, the author might have been acting out of anger and hurt, which could mitigate the wrongness. \n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, sharing someone's private views without their consent is generally wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if the views are harmful, the act of disclosure without permission could be considered a violation. The author might not have considered the consequences for their mom, like losing friends or being shamed. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's actions were hurtful, and the author felt powerless. The action might be seen as a form of self-defense or seeking support. But is it the author's place to expose their mom? Maybe not. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without consent, even if the mom's behavior was bad. The right approach might have been to talk to the friends privately or seek support elsewhere without exposing their mom.\n"
