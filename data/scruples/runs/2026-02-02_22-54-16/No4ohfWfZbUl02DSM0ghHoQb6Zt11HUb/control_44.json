She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who came out to their mom and then told her gay friends about her reaction is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out as gay, and their mom had a negative reaction, including religious judgment and cutting off contact. The author was hurt and upset. Then they messaged their mom's gay friends, telling them that their mom is a homophobe. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nSo, considering the moral aspects here. On one hand, the mom's reaction was hurtful and discriminatory. The author felt powerless and maybe wanted to protect others from her mom's homophobia. But on the other hand, the author shared private information about their mom without her consent. That could be seen as violating privacy, even if the intent was good.\n\nThe author's intent might matter. They were upset and might have wanted to warn her friends. But spreading personal family matters can be seen as gossip or betrayal. Even if the mom's views are harmful, the author's action of disclosing this to others might have crossed a line.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of conflict resolution. Maybe the author could have addressed the issue through other means, like seeking support or counseling, instead of directly informing others. But the author was in a vulnerable state, so their judgment might have been clouded by emotions.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but ethically, sharing a parent's private reaction without their consent could be problematic. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was to protect others from discrimination. However, the method of addressing the issue by spreading the information could still be seen as wrong because it's a personal family matter. \n\nDifferent people might have different views. Some might support the author for standing up against homophobia, while others might think it's unwise to involve others in family dynamics. The key points here are privacy, intent, and the appropriateness of the action taken.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the disclosure was necessary and respectful. Since the author didn't seek to resolve the issue directly with the mother first and instead went to others, that might be considered wrong. However, given the mother's harmful behavior, the author's action could be seen as justified. But ethically, the author might still be in the wrong because of the breach of privacy and the way they handled it.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because sharing private family information without consent, even with good intentions, is typically considered a breach of trust. However, others might argue B because the mother's actions were harmful. But the standard answer in such cases usually sides with respecting privacy, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
