She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they came out as gay to their mom, who reacted badly, and then the person told their mom's gay friends that the mom is a homophobe. The question is if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom rejected her child, called them names, and cut off communication. That's pretty bad. The author was hurt and upset. They reached out to their mom's friends, who are gay, to inform them about their mom's stance. The author's reasoning is partly to let the friends know their friend's true nature and also because they were angry.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. On one hand, they were in a vulnerable state and might have acted out of anger. Telling the friends could be seen as gossiping or betraying their mom's trust, but the mom has already betrayed the author by rejecting them. Also, the friends might already have an idea of their friend's views if the mom hasn't been accepting. \n\nBut is the author justified? The key points are: 1) Did the author have permission to share personal family matters? Probably not. 2) Was the intent malicious? The author mentions they wanted to inform the friends about their mom's beliefs, which could be a valid reason if the mom's behavior affects them. However, the method of sharing (without consent) might be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a situation where they feel wronged. The mom's actions are harmful, and the author might feel that the friends should know the truth, especially if the mom pretends to be accepting while holding opposite views. The author's action could be seen as a form of self-defense or transparency, even if done in anger. \n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing personal family issues without consent can be a breach of privacy. However, when one party is being harmed and the information shared is about their own life, the lines get blurry. The friends might appreciate knowing the truth, even if it's delivered in a harsh way. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's action was unkind and possibly a breach of trust, but given the mom's rejection, the author might have felt it necessary to protect themselves or be honest with others. The answer could be that the author is partially in the wrong for sharing the information without a clear reason beyond anger, but maybe not entirely. However, according to AITA standards, often actions taken in anger or without considering consequences are seen as the person being at fault. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
