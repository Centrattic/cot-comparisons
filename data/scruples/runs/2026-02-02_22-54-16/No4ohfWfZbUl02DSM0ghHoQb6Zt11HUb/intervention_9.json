She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who reacted badly, saying they'd go to hell and cutting off communication. The author then told the mom's gay friends about the mom's homophobia, which caused some tension.\n\nHmm. So the key points here. The author was hurt and upset after their mother's rejection. They confided in the mother's friends, who are gay, to inform them that their friend (the mother) is a homophobe. The author might have done this partly in anger and partly to make the friends aware of the mother's true beliefs.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the mother's actions were harmful and hurtful. The author was going through a tough time and might have felt like they had no other choice but to reach out to someone. The friends in question are part of the same social circle and might have known the mother's stance already, but the author's action could be seen as spreading gossip or revealing private information without consent. \n\nBut wait, the mother's beliefs are her own, even if they're hurtful. The author might have felt justified in sharing the truth, especially if the friends were under the impression that the mother was more accepting. However, the act of disclosing private family conversations to others without permission can be considered a breach of trust. Even if the message was in anger, the author was the one who initiated sharing that information.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's friends might have been unaware of her true feelings. By informing them, the author could be protecting the friends from being hurt by the mother's hypocrisy. But is it the author's place to do that? The author might not have considered that they were the middleman in their mother's relationship with her friends. \n\nI think the main issue here is the breach of privacy and the method used. Even if the mother's actions were wrong, the author's response was to inform others, which could be seen as retaliatory rather than constructive. The author was in a vulnerable state and acted out of anger. While the mother's reaction was unacceptable, the author's action might have crossed a line by involving others without considering the consequences or their mother's right to privacy. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were understandable, but the action of revealing private information without consent could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they shared personal family matters with others, which is a breach of trust and privacy, even if the mother's behavior was harmful.\n"
