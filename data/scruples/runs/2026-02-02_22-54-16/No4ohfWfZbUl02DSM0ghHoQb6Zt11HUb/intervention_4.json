She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay to their mom and then told the mom's gay friends about her reaction is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The mom had a negative reaction, being religious and saying the child would go to Hell. The mom isn't accepting and has cut off communication. The author, feeling hurt and angry, decided to tell the mom's gay friends about her homophobia. The author's reasoning was to inform these friends about their friend's true beliefs, even though the mom had never directly said anything to them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's motivation was partly out of spite and hurt. They were upset and wanted to make the friends aware. But did they have the right to do that? \n\nOn one hand, the author was in a vulnerable state and might have acted impulsively. They were trying to seek support or validation, maybe. But sharing someone else's private beliefs without consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. The mom's friends might have preferred to hear that directly from her instead of through their child. \n\nAlso, even if the mom's views are harmful, the author's action might have violated their mother's privacy. The friends could now feel betrayed if they found out through the author instead of their own relationship with the mother. Plus, the author might have assumed the friends wanted to know, but maybe they didn't. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a difficult situation where their mother's behavior was hurtful. They might have felt they had no other way to express their frustration. However, there's an argument that the author should have handled it differently, maybe by seeking support elsewhere instead of disclosing their mother's personal views without her consent.\n\nPrivacy is a big factor here. Even if the mother's views are unacceptable, the author's action could be seen as a breach of trust. Families have private matters, and sharing that with others without consent is a problem regardless of the reason. The author's intention might have been to protect the friends from being misled by their friend (the mother), but that doesn't justify spreading the information without permission.\n\nSo, considering all these angles, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal family matters without consent, even if it was done out of hurt and anger. The action was a breach of privacy, even if the mother's behavior was problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
