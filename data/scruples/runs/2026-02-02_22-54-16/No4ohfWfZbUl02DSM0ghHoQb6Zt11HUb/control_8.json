She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out as gay to their mother, who had a negative reaction, using religious reasons and making it clear she wouldn't accept them or their partner. The parents aren't responding to messages. The author, hurt and angry, messaged the mother's gay friends to inform them about the rejection and that the mother is a homophobe, even though the mother has friends who are gay. The author's mom is part of the dog show community with these friends. The action here is the author sharing their mother's reaction and her stance with others.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: the author is upset, the mother has friends who are gay but the mother still holds those anti-gay views, and the author told those friends about the mother's rejection.\n\nIs it wrong to inform someone else about a friend's unacceptable behavior? Well, the mother's friends are gay, and they might be aware of her views, but the author's disclosure adds new information\u2014that she rejected their child after they came out. Maybe the friends already knew she was religious and had those beliefs, but the author is revealing the extent of her homophobia now. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have a right to seek support or to align themselves with others who are in the same situation. However, the author didn't directly confront their mother but instead informed third parties. Is this a betrayal of the mother's trust? She's the one who has been isolating her child, but the friends might be part of her social circle. The author is sharing personal family matters with others. \n\nBut wait, the friends are also part of the community she's criticizing. The mother's friends are gay, and she still treats the author this way. The author could argue that they are protecting others from her mother's behavior, especially if they think the mother might try to interact with the friends despite her beliefs. Alternatively, the author might feel that the friends need to know the truth about their friend's stance, especially if the mother is being hypocritical.\n\nYet, the question is about the author's right. Even if the mother is a homophobe, the author is choosing to disclose this information to others. The mother might have even shared her own views with them, but the author is giving a personal account. The motive is partly in spite, as the author mentions being angry. \n\nIs it a moral wrong? It depends on the intent and the impact. If the author is trying to protect the friends from her mother, maybe not. But if it's just out of spite, maybe the author is overstepping. Also, the friends might have their own relationship with the mother, and the author is adding to the conflict without their consent. The author could have approached their mother first to try to mend the situation or at least considered if the friends wanted to be informed. \n\nIn some cases, people might do this to get support or to feel heard. The author's message could be a way to express their pain and seek solidarity. However, sharing such personal and potentially sensitive information about a family member without their consent can be seen as gossip or betrayal, even if the content is negative. The friends might not want to be involved, and the author's action could complicate their relationships. \n\nBut if the mother's behavior is harmful and the author feels they can't talk to her directly, maybe it's a way to find allies. The friends are part of a group the mother is associated with, so the author might think they need to know the truth to not be deceived by her. \n\nI think it's a gray area. The author is hurt and acting from anger, but the action of informing the friends directly could be seen as crossing a boundary. The mother might have her own right to privacy, even if her views are wrong. The friends might not appreciate being told this without their direct friend (the mother) addressing it first. \n\nSo, the answer might be A, that the author is in the wrong, because they shared personal family information without consent, even if the mother's actions were harmful. However, others might argue that the author is justified in seeking support and transparency. But generally, the act of disclosing a family member's behavior to others without their knowledge can be considered a breach of privacy, even if it's negative. So the author's action is inconsiderate, even if their intent was to inform the friends about the mother's true nature.\n"
