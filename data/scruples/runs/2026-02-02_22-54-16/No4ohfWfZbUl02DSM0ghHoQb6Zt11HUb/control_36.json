She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they came out as gay to their mom, who had a bad reaction\u2014calling them to hell, being disappointed, not accepting them. The mom has friends who are gay, and the author messaged one couple to tell them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mom is religious and didn't accept her child, which is hurtful. The author, feeling hurt and powerless, reached out to the mom's gay friends to inform them about her mom's views. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified in wanting to inform the friends about the mom's homophobia. They were upset and maybe wanted to protect the friends from being hurt, knowing that the mom might have similar views. But on the other hand, is it right to expose someone's private views without their consent? The mom hasn't publicly shared these views, so maybe the author crossed a line by revealing her stance.\n\nAlso, the author's mom might have a right to privacy. Even if her beliefs are harmful, sharing that information without her consent could be seen as violating her privacy. The author might have acted out of anger and hurt, which can cloud judgment. But the friends have a right to know if the mom's behavior towards them is problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friends are already aware of the mom's possible views through her actions, but maybe not the extent. The author's message might have been a way to explain why the mom isn't accepting, but was it their place to do that? Maybe the author should have handled it differently, like talking to their mom first or seeking support elsewhere instead of informing the friends directly.\n\nAlso, the mom's friends might feel betrayed if the author shared private family matters with them. The author could have damaged the relationship between the mom and her friends, which isn't fair. The author's intention was to warn the friends, but the method might be inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting others and respecting privacy. The author might not be in the right because they shared personal information without consent, regardless of their motives. Even if the mom's views are harmful, the author didn't have the right to out her like that. It's possible that the author should have focused on seeking support for themselves instead of informing others about the mom's private beliefs.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because they shared their mother's private views without her permission, which breaches trust and privacy, even if the intent was to warn friends. They should have found another way to handle the situation, like seeking support groups or counseling, rather than informing the friends directly.\n"
