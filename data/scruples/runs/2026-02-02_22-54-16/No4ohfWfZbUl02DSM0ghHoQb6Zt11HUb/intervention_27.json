She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who reacted negatively, using religious reasons to say they'd go to hell. The mom stopped communicating. The author felt hurt and powerless, then messaged the mom's gay friends, revealing the mom's homophobia. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo the main points here are: the mom's rejection, the author's emotional state, and the action taken towards the friends. \n\nThe author's action was sharing personal information about their mom with others. The friends are also part of a group (gay) that the mom disapproves of, according to the author. The question is whether the author overstepped by informing the friends about the mom's stance.\n\nOn one hand, the author was in a vulnerable state after a hurtful experience. They might have felt justified in exposing the mom's hypocrisy, especially if the friends were unaware of her true feelings. On the other hand, sharing someone's personal information, even if you're upset, can be seen as invading privacy or spreading gossip. \n\nBut wait, the mom's behavior towards her own child is harmful. The author might have felt that the friends were being misled if they didn't know the mom's true beliefs. However, the author didn't consult the friends first or seek to resolve the issue with their mom before airing it out. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between self-advocacy and respecting others' privacy. The author's action could be protective of the friends if the mom is indeed a homophobe, but it's also a breach of their mom's privacy. However, given the mom's treatment of the author, some might argue the author had a right to express their truth, even if it's unflattering. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have handled it more privately, like not informing the friends directly but seeking support elsewhere. The act of informing the friends might have been impulsive due to anger and hurt, which complicates whether it's a justified action. \n\nSo, considering all angles: the mom's actions are problematic, the author's emotional state, and the nature of the disclosure. The answer might hinge on whether the disclosure was necessary and if there were better ways to handle it. But since the author's intent was to inform the friends about their mom's true beliefs, which could be important for the friends' awareness, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the method of disclosure could be questioned. Still, given the context, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong), but some might argue A. However, considering the mom's harmful behavior, the author's action could be seen as a form of self-expression and protecting others from potential hypocrisy.\n"
