She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out to their mom, who had a negative religious reaction. The mom is also friends with gay people but probably judges them. The author, hurt and upset, told her mom's gay friends that their mom is a homophobe. The question is if the author did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author was hurt and wanted to share their experience. But did they have the right to tell others about their mom's views? The mom's friends are her friends, so maybe the author shouldn't have shared that without consent. Even if the mom's actions were harmful, sharing personal information without permission might be crossing a line. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was in emotional pain and wanted support. They might not have known how else to cope. But does that justify sharing private family matters with others, even if it's about the mother's behavior? Also, the friends might be friends with the mom, so the author could have broken trust by not discussing it with the mom first. However, the mom is the one who's been rejecting the author, so maybe the friends deserve to know if they're friends with someone who holds those views.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author overstepped. Generally, sharing someone's personal beliefs, especially negative ones, without their consent can be considered a breach of privacy. Even if the mom's views are harmful, the author's action might not be justified. The friends might have already known or not, but the author's message could have damaged the mom's relationships. The author's intent was to inform the friends about their mom's views, which could be seen as gossip or betrayal.\n\nSo the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared personal family information without consent, even if it was done out of hurt and anger. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) because the mom's actions were harmful, and the friends have a right to know. But typically, even if someone is wronged, sharing that information without permission can be seen as wrong. So probably A is the better answer.\n"
