She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a very negative reaction, even calling them a disappointment and using religious arguments. The mom then cut off communication. The author felt hurt and angry, so they messaged some of the mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's homophobia and how she rejected them. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's intent and the potential consequences. The author was upset and wanted to inform the friends about their mom's stance. On one hand, the author is defending themselves and possibly helping the friends avoid being blindsided by the mom's hypocrisy. On the other hand, the author might have crossed a line by sharing their mom's personal views without her consent, which could be seen as gossiping or betraying privacy.\n\nI should consider the context. The mom is friends with gay people but is a homophobe. The author is pointing out the irony. However, even if the mom's behavior is problematic, the author's action of informing her friends might be seen as justified in exposing her hypocrisy. But at the same time, sharing someone's private behavior without their knowledge could be considered a violation of trust, even if the person is in the wrong.\n\nBut in this case, the author is sharing their own experience. They were the ones who came out and faced rejection. The mom's friends might already know she's religious and judgmental, but the author is giving them direct information about her stance. The friends might appreciate knowing the truth to protect themselves, especially if the mom pretends to be accepting. However, the author might have acted out of anger and not considered the repercussions, like damaging their relationship with their parents further or causing conflict through their mom's friends.\n\nThe key factors are intent and the nature of the disclosure. If the author's intent was to protect others from their mom's harmful beliefs, maybe it's understandable. But if it's just about venting anger without considering the consequences, then it's more of a problem. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some views, it's okay to speak out against injustice, even if it involves a parent. In others, respecting family privacy is paramount regardless of the situation.\n\nI need to balance these perspectives. The mom's actions are wrong, but the author's method of addressing it could be seen as inappropriate. However, the author is also dealing with trauma and anger, which might mitigate judgment. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. Some might say they have a right to share their experience, especially to prevent others from being deceived. Others might say it's a breach of privacy and not their place to do so. The answer might be A (yes) or B (no), but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong because sharing personal, emotionally charged information about a parent without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust, even if done in response to hurt or anger. While the mother's reaction was harmful, the author's action of informing her friends about her stance without her knowledge may have crossed a boundary, especially since it could damage relationships and privacy. The situation highlights complex emotions, but the act of disclosing someone else's private behavior, regardless of intent, often has consequences that extend beyond the immediate issue.",
