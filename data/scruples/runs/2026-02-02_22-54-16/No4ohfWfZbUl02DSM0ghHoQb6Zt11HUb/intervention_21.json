She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mother, who reacted negatively, using religious reasons and rejecting them. The mom also cut off contact. The author then told their mom's gay friends about this rejection, possibly to inform them about her homophobia. The author is now questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mother's homophobia, the author's hurt feelings, and the action of informing the mother's friends about her rejection. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The mother's behavior is clearly harmful and discriminatory. The author was hurt and upset. When people are in emotional distress, they might act impulsively. The question is whether sharing personal family issues with others, even if those others are friends of family, is an overstep.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel they're standing up against their mother's homophobia by informing her friends. It could be seen as a form of advocacy for the gay community, especially since the mother is friends with gay people but holds prejudiced views. On the other hand, sharing family matters without consent might violate privacy. The author might have breached confidentiality between parent and child, even if the mother isn't being supportive.\n\nBut the mother isn't being a supportive parent here, which complicates things. The author is in a vulnerable position. The action taken could be seen as a defense mechanism. However, is it right to out someone's stance, even if it's negative, to their friends? That could lead to social consequences for the mother, which might not be fair. But if the mother is already being harmful, maybe the author's action is justified as a form of self-defense or protecting others from similar harm.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friends (the couple) were already aware of the mother through dog shows. If the mother's homophobia affects her interactions with them, maybe the author is protecting those friends by informing them. But again, it's a privacy issue. The author didn't get permission to share this information.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often hinges on intent and the balance of harm. The author's intent was to inform people who might be affected by their mother's views. However, sharing without consent could be seen as wrong, even if the mother is at fault. The author might not be in the wrong because they were acting under emotional distress and trying to protect others from similar treatment. But some might argue that it's still a breach of trust.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (No), because the author was reacting to their mother's harmful behavior, and the action, while possibly unorthodox, was in response to rejection and to protect others. However, there's a counterpoint about privacy. The community might split, but in AITA threads, often if the person is standing up against bullying or harmful behavior, they're seen as not at fault. So, leaning towards B.\n"
