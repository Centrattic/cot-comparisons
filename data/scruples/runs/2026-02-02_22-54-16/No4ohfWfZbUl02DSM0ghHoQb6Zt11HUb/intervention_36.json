She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that the mom rejected them after coming out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, including religious condemnation and disapproval. The mom isn't responding, and the author is hurt. Then, the author messaged some of the mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's homophobia and rejection. The author's reason was to inform these friends about their friend's true beliefs, which might affect the friends' interactions with the mom.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author isn't, but wants others' opinions. The answer options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author is sharing personal information about their mother's reaction with third parties. Did they have the right to do that? On one hand, the mom's friends might appreciate knowing her true stance, especially if they're also LGBTQ+, but sharing this could be seen as violating privacy or being a breach of trust. The author might feel justified because they're hurt and seeking support, but intentionally sharing sensitive family issues with others could be crossing a line. \n\nThe mom's friends might have their own relationship with her, and the author stepping in to inform them could affect that dynamic. However, the mother's behavior towards her own child is questionable, and the friends might not be aware of her true views. The author's action could be seen as a form of self-defense or protecting others from potential hypocrisy.\n\nBut from a privacy standpoint, the author didn't ask for permission to share their mother's reaction. Even if the mother's actions are harmful, the author might not have the right to disclose that information to others without consent. However, given the context of abuse and rejection, some might argue it's a justified action to protect oneself and inform others.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the harm caused by the mother's behavior is significant, and the author was in emotional distress. However, the act of informing the mother's friends without her consent could be considered a breach of privacy. But considering the mother's own harmful actions, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. It's a tricky situation. \n\nIn many cases, people might feel that sharing such information is a form of self-advocacy, especially when facing rejection and needing support. The friends might appreciate knowing the truth to make their own decisions about the relationship. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that it's still gossip or spreading personal family issues. \n\nI think the key factors here are the mother's harmful behavior and the author's emotional state. The action was a response to being hurt and rejected, and the intent was to inform the friends about their friend's true stance. Given that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
