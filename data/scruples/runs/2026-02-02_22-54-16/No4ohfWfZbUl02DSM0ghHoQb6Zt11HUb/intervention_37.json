She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong (AITA) for telling her mom's gay friends that her mom rejected her when she came out. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author came out to her mom, who had a negative reaction, including religious condemnation and disapproval. The mom stopped communicating with the author and her dad. The author, hurt and angry, messaged the mom's gay friends, explaining the situation and revealing her mom's homophobia. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author was in a vulnerable state, upset after being rejected. She reached out to the mom's friends, possibly to warn them about her mom's stance. On one hand, the author might feel justified in wanting to protect these friends from being judged by someone who is homophobic. On the other hand, she's sharing personal family matters without consent, which could be seen as a breach of privacy or gossiping.\n\nAnother angle: The author's actions could be seen as a form of seeking support or justice, but it might have been a way to vent anger rather than a thoughtful decision. The friends might feel betrayed if the author didn't consult them first. Also, the mom's friends might have their own way of handling the situation, and the author's message could damage relationships between the mom and her friends.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The author's intent matters. If she did it to protect the friends from future harm (since the mom is homophobic), maybe it's understandable. But if it was just spite, that's different. The author mentions she was angry and in tears, so maybe her actions were impulsive rather than calculated.\n\nI need to balance empathy for the author's hurt feelings against the potential harm in disclosing her mom's private views to others. The key points are consent, intent, and the impact. The author didn't ask her mom's permission, but the mom's actions were already causing harm. The friends might have a right to know if the mom is spreading harmful beliefs.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might be understandable given the emotional state, sharing personal family issues with others without consent can be seen as crossing a line. So, the answer might lean towards AITA, meaning the author is in the wrong. But there's also a strong argument for emotional context. However, the standard advice is that even if someone is upset, sharing such details without consent is generally considered wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
