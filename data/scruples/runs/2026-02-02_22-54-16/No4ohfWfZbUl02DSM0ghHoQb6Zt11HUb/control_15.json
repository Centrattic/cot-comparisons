She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, mentioned religious reasons, and stopped communicating. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends, sharing the bad reaction and labeling the mom as a homophobe.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether sharing this information with the mom's friends is wrong. The author was hurt and upset, which might have influenced their decision. But is it okay to inform someone else's friends about their behavior, even if that behavior is problematic?\n\nOn one hand, the mom's actions are indeed harmful and bigoted. The author might feel justified in wanting to protect others from similar treatment. On the other hand, the author didn't get their mom's permission to share this information. It could be seen as a breach of privacy or a form of retaliation. Even if the mom's friends are gay, the author might be exposing their mom's private conversations, which could damage relationships on both sides.\n\nAlso, the author's intent was partly out of anger and spite, which complicates things. While the mom is at fault for her reaction, the author's method of addressing it might not be the right approach. Instead of confronting the mom directly or seeking support through appropriate channels, they chose to inform third parties, which could be seen as gossiping or airing a family issue publicly.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that the author was trying to be honest about their mom's behavior, especially since those friends might not be aware of it. But the way it was done\u2014without the mom's knowledge or consent\u2014could be problematic. It's a delicate balance between protecting oneself and respecting others' privacy.\n\nIn similar situations, people often debate the ethics of sharing someone's private behavior with others. If the friends had asked the author about their mom's stance, the author might have a right to answer truthfully, but proactively informing them without being asked could be crossing a line.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think the author is in the wrong. They didn't handle the situation appropriately by sharing their mom's private reactions with others. It's better to address such issues through direct communication or seek support elsewhere without involving third parties in this manner.\n"
