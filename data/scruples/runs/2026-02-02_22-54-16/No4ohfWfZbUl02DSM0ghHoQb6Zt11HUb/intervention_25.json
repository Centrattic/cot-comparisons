She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who came out to their mom and then told her gay friends about her reaction is in the wrong. The mom was religious and rejected them, leading to the author feeling hurt and isolated. The author then messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the mother's rejection, the author's emotional state, and the action taken. The author was upset and shared their mother's stance with her friends. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nFirst, the mother is the one who caused the conflict by being homophobic and cutting off contact. The author felt powerless and reached out to others for support. By informing the mother's friends about her views, the author might have intended to protect themselves or seek solidarity. However, sharing someone's private beliefs with others without consent could be seen as violating privacy. But considering the context\u2014family conflict and homophobia\u2014it's a tough call.\n\nOn one hand, the author is defending themselves and possibly trying to find support. On the other hand, they might have breached confidentiality. However, the mother's behavior was harmful, and the author was in a vulnerable state. It's a situation where the action could be justified as self-defense or seeking support, especially if the friends were also part of a community that might understand. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
