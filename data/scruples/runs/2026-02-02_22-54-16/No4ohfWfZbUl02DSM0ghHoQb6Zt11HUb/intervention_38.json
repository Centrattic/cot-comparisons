She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that the mom rejected them after coming out as gay. The situation is that the mom was very religious and didn't accept the author's sexuality, leading them to reach out to the mom's gay friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author was hurt and upset. Their mom had friends who are gay, but the mom herself is against that lifestyle. The author felt the need to inform these friends about their mom's true feelings, which might have been a mix of anger and wanting to hold their mom accountable. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because they were trying to protect the friends from potential hypocrisy. The mom had friends who are part of the LGBTQ+ community but didn't support her own child. The author could see this as a contradiction and wanted to correct it. However, sharing personal family issues without the parent's consent could be seen as a breach of privacy and trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the action was taken in a moment of emotional distress. The author might not have considered the consequences, like damaging the mom's relationships with her friends or causing unnecessary conflict. Even if the mom's actions were hypocritical, the author's response could be seen as crossing a boundary by revealing private family matters to others.\n\nBut then again, the author's intent was clear: to inform the friends about the mom's true stance. If the friends were already aware that the mom was religious but had gay friends, maybe they had some idea, but the author's message was more direct. This could be a case of standing up for oneself, albeit in a way that might not be the healthiest.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the mom's own behavior. She rejected her child, which is a serious issue. The author might feel that exposing this hypocrisy is a necessary step, even if it's hurtful. However, whether that makes it right is another question. In ethical terms, intent matters, but so does the method. \n\nI think the key points are consent and the impact on relationships. The author didn't get permission to share this information, which is a problem. Even if the message was true, sharing it without consent can harm others. But the context of being hurt and trying to correct a hypocritical situation adds nuance. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer isn't straightforward. The author might be in the wrong for breaching privacy, but they were acting out of pain and a desire to protect their friends. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. However, typically, sharing personal family issues without permission is considered a breach, so the answer might lean towards A (wrong), but there's room for argument either way.\n"
