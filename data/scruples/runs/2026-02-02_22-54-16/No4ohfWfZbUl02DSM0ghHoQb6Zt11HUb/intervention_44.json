She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The mom reacted negatively, religiously condemning the author's sexuality and cutting off contact. The author, feeling hurt and powerless, reached out to their mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's mom is a homophobe, the author is upset, and they shared this information with her friends. Now, the question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author was in emotional distress and might have felt a need to confide in others, especially since the mom's friends are also part of the LGBTQ+ community. The author might have wanted to warn them about the mom's true feelings. But did they have the right to do that without their mom's consent? \n\nOn the other hand, sharing personal family matters without permission could be seen as a breach of privacy. The mom might view this as the author spreading gossip or betraying family trust. However, the author's actions were a reaction to being rejected and could be seen as a form of self-expression in a vulnerable state. \n\nIt's important to consider the intent. The author wanted to inform their mom's friends about her homophobia, which is a valid concern given the mom's stance. But is it the author's place to do so? The friends might appreciate knowing the truth, but the author might have overstepped by revealing their mother's private beliefs without her consent.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friends are part of the same community the mom is hostile towards. The author might feel a sense of solidarity with them, wanting to protect them from potential hypocrisy. However, this could also lead to conflict within the family and potentially hurt relationships.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sharing family secrets without consent is generally frowned upon, but exceptions can be made for serious issues. The mom's rejection and religious condemnation are serious, and the author might feel justified in warning others. \n\nBut is it right to act out of anger or hurt? The author mentions they did it in spite, which complicates the situation. Acting impulsively in an emotional state might not be the best approach, but the underlying issue is the mom's homophobia.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the information shared was harmful. If the friends already knew their friend was a homophobe, maybe not. If the author exposed her in a way that's public or damaging, that's different. The author's message was a private message, so perhaps it's more about transparency between friends.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a breach of privacy, the author's actions stem from a place of hurt and a desire to connect with supportive friends. It's a complex situation where the wrong is not clear-cut, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for sharing without consent, even if the intent was to protect others.\n"
