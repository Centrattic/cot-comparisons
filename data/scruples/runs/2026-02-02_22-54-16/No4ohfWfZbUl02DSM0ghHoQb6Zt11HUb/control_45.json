She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, including religious condemnation and cutting off contact. The author felt hurt and powerless. Then, they messaged their mom's gay friends to tell them about this rejection and the mom's homophobia. The question is if this action was wrong.\n\nSo, from one angle, the author might feel they were justified because their mom's friends are also part of the LGBTQ+ community, and the mom's behavior is harmful. The author could see this as protecting those friends from being misled about their mom's true stance, even if the mom didn't openly express it to them. Maybe the author wanted to prevent those friends from feeling conflicted if they interact with the mom, knowing she's a homophobe.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing this information without the mom's consent could be seen as spreading gossip or violating privacy. The author might have acted out of anger and hurt, which can cloud judgment. Even if the mom is wrong, the author's action might be considered a breach of trust or an invasion of privacy since the mom's friends might not have been aware of her views. Also, the author might not be in a position to act as a judge of their mom's character and share it with others, regardless of the motives.\n\nIt's a tough call. The mom's behavior is definitely problematic, but the author's response could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. The key points are intent, the right to privacy, and whether the action caused more harm than good. If the friends were already aware of the mom's beliefs, maybe the author isn't wrong. But if the author is revealing things the mom hasn't said to them, that's crossing a line. However, given the mom's history of not accepting her child, maybe the author felt justified in protecting the friends from a toxic relationship.\n\nHmm, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared personal family information without consent, even if the intent was to inform others about the mom's homophobia. Privacy and consent are important here. The author might have acted out of hurt, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Alternatively, if the friends are part of the same community and the mom's actions could affect them, maybe the author isn't wrong. But I think the general consensus would lean towards AITA for the author because they spread the mom's private views without her permission, which is a breach of trust. So the answer is A.\n"
