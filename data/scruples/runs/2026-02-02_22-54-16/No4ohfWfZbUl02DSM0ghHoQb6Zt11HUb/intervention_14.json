She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who reacted negatively, saying they'd go to hell and that she's disappointed. The mom and dad aren't responding. The author, feeling hurt and angry, told their mom's gay friends about the mom's homophobia. The question is if the author is in the wrong for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author is sharing personal family information with others. That might be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the content is about the mother's harmful beliefs. The friends might have a right to know if their friend is being hypocritical, especially if they were previously unaware. But is it the author's place to disclose that information?\n\nThe author was upset and acting out of emotional pain. Motive matters here. They were hurt and wanted to inform the friends about their mother's stance. But did they have the right to do so without their mother's consent? Even if the mother is a homophobe, sharing that info could be seen as gossiping or betraying trust, especially if the mother didn't know her friends were being told. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the friends have a right to know if their friend holds views that are harmful or hypocritical. The author's mom is part of a community where other gay people are involved, so there's a potential hypocrisy. The author might feel that by informing the friends, they're protecting their own mental health or seeking support, but does that justify the action?\n\nAlso, the context of the author's coming out and the negative reaction adds to the emotional complexity. The author might feel like they have no support and are acting in self-defense. But the action of informing others could have consequences, like damaging relationships or causing further conflict. \n\nThere's a balance between protecting oneself and respecting boundaries. The author didn't ask the mother's permission, which is a breach of privacy. Even if the content is negative, sharing personal family matters with others without consent is generally frowned upon. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being on the author's side, but there are arguments both ways. \n\nThe key factors are intent, breach of privacy, and the context of emotional distress. The author's intent was to inform friends about their mother's views, possibly to align the friends' expectations or to vent. However, the method might be inappropriate. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the disclosure was justified given the circumstances. \n\nIn many cases, sharing such information without consent can be seen as wrong, even if the content is about harmful behavior. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private family information without permission. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because the mother's views are hurtful and the friends have a right to know. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The action, regardless of motive, involves sharing private information. Even if the motive is to expose hypocrisy, the act itself is a breach of privacy. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
