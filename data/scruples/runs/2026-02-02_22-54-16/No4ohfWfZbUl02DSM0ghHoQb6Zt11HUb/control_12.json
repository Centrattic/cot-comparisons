She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who reacted negatively, and then the author told their mom's gay friends about her homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The mom rejected the author, called them names, and is not accepting. The author then confided in their mom's gay friends, sharing that the mom is a homophobe. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the author's action was to inform others about their mother's views. The mom's friends are gay, and the mom herself is close to them but holds opposing views. The author might have done this out of hurt and anger, feeling powerless. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. On one hand, the author was hurt and wanted to share their experience, possibly to warn the friends or seek support. On the other hand, did they have the right to spread their mother's beliefs without her consent? \n\nPrivacy is a factor. The author didn't ask for permission to share their mom's reactions. Public shaming or exposing someone's private views can be problematic. But the author's intent might have been to protect others from similar treatment, especially if the mom's friends aren't aware of her true stance.\n\nAlso, the mom's hypocrisy is a point. She's friends with gay people but holds negative views. The author might feel justified in exposing that, but does that make it right? \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the mom's actions are wrong, the author disclosing that information could be seen as harmful. The mom's friends might feel betrayed, even if they agree with the author's perspective. The author's action might damage relationships and escalate conflict.\n\nBut considering the emotional state of the author, they were in distress and acting from a place of pain. However, that doesn't necessarily excuse the action. There are better ways to handle such situations, like seeking personal support without exposing others.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong. They violated their mother's privacy and potentially hurt others. Even if the mom is at fault, the author's actions can be seen as crossing a line. So, the answer would be A for Yes.\n"
