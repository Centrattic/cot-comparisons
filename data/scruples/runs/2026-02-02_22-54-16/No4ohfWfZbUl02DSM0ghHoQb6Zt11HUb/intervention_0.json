She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who had a really bad reaction, calling them to hell and rejecting them. The mom also has gay friends, but the author messaged those friends to tell them about her homophobia. The author is asking if they did something wrong.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the ethics here. The author was hurt and felt rejected. They might have been acting out of anger or hurt. On one hand, they have the right to express their feelings, but on the other hand, sharing personal family issues with others without consent could be problematic.\n\nThe mom's friends might not want their relationship with the author's mom to be affected by this information. The author didn't ask for their mom's permission to share this, which could be seen as violating privacy. However, the mom's behavior towards the author might justify the author wanting to inform her friends about her stance. But is the author allowed to do that?\n\nAlso, the author's actions could be seen as a form of retaliation. They might have felt powerless and decided to act out by spreading this information. But does that make it right? It's a gray area. Some might say that the author has the right to protect themselves and be honest, especially if the mom was being hypocritical. Others might say that the author shouldn't have used their mom's friends as a way to express their anger without considering the consequences.\n\nI need to think about both sides. The author's emotional state is understandable, but sharing personal family matters with others without consent isn't typically advised. However, in this case, the mom's actions were harmful. Maybe the friends had a right to know if their friend (the mom) holds those views, especially if the mom pretends to be okay with them while being against it. The author might have felt that their mom's friends should know the truth to be aware of her real stance.\n\nBut then again, the author's mom might have privacy rights in her own views, even if they're negative. The author didn't confront the mom directly, maybe because they felt it wouldn't help. But sharing it with others could damage relationships and might be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might depend on cultural or personal ethics. But generally, the action of informing others without consent might be considered wrong, even if the intent was to expose hypocrisy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A), but others might argue they're not (B). The question is whether the action was justified despite the method.\n"
