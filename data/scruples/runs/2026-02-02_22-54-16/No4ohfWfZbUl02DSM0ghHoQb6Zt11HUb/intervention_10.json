She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user wants to know if the person who came out as gay to their mom and then told her gay friends about the rejection is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author came out and faced a negative reaction from their mother, who is religious and said they'd go to hell. The mom isn't responding, and the author felt hurt and powerless. In their anger and emotional state, they messaged the mom's gay friends, explaining the mother's homophobia. The key points are the emotional state of the author, the intent behind the message, and the potential consequences.\n\nThe author's mom has friends who are gay, but the mom herself is against it. The author, feeling hurt, decided to inform these friends about their mother's stance. Now, is this right or wrong?\n\nFrom one angle, the author might think they're protecting themselves or being honest with the friends, especially if they believe the friends might not know their mom's true feelings. However, the author didn't ask the mother's permission or confirm if the friends already knew. This could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if the mother's actions were harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a vulnerable state, upset by their mother's rejection. They might have felt justified in sharing the truth to prevent the friends from being misled. But sharing personal family matters without consent can be seen as oversharing, regardless of the reason.\n\nAnother aspect is the impact on the friends. If the friends already knew their host's mother was a homophobe, maybe the author isn't adding much. But if they didn't know, the author's message could affect their relationship with the mother. However, the author's primary intent was to share their own experience, which is a personal choice, but sharing it to others might be crossing a line.\n\nThere's also the question of the author's right to share their story. They might feel they have the right to express their hurt, but doing so to others might not be necessary. The friends are adults and might have their own way of handling their relationship with the mother. The author's action could be seen as meddling, even if out of pain.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might have had good intentions, but the act of sharing personal family issues with others without consent could be considered oversharing. It's a delicate balance between expressing one's feelings and respecting boundaries. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A), but there are mitigating circumstances. However, the answer is likely AITA, which usually sides with the person being wronged, but the action itself could be seen as a mistake.\n"
