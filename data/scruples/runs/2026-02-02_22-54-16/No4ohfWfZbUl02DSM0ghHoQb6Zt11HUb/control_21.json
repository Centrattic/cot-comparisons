She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who came out to their mom and then told her gay friends about her homophobia is in the wrong. So, first, I need to consider both sides.\n\nThe person came out and faced a negative reaction from their mom, including religious rejection. They felt hurt and powerless. Then they messaged their mom's gay friends, informing them that their mom is a homophobe. The key issue here is whether sharing this information was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the person might feel betrayed and upset. They might think that since their mom has friends who are gay, it's important to let those friends know about her true beliefs, even if she doesn't show it. They could argue self-defense or protecting others from being misled.\n\nOn the other hand, the person didn't seek to resolve the issue directly with their mom before involving others. Spreading the information could be seen as gossiping or violating privacy, even if the intent was to protect others. It might also escalate tensions within the family and harm relationships without giving the mom a chance to change her stance.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional state of the person when they did this\u2014being in tears and angry\u2014could imply that the action was impulsive rather than well-considered. However, the justification might be that they felt cornered and had no other recourse. \n\nI need to weigh the intent versus the action. Intent was to inform others about their mom's beliefs, possibly to protect her friends from being deceived. But the method of disclosure without the mom's consent might be problematic. In many cultures, sharing family matters without consent can be seen as crossing a boundary, regardless of intent.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of whether the mom's friends have a right to know if she's being hypocritical. However, it's possible that the mom's friends already know her views or that this information is personal. The person didn't approach their mom to address the issue first, which might be a step they should have taken before informing others.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sometimes people act out of hurt, but whether that justifies the action is debatable. The answer might depend on cultural context and family dynamics. But generally, the consensus here might lean towards the person being in the wrong for sharing private family matters without addressing it directly first.\n"
