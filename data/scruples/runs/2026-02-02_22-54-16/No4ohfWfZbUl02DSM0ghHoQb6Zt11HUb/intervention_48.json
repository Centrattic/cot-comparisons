She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The author's mom is religious and didn't accept their sexuality, leading to the author feeling hurt and upset. The author then shared this information with their mom's gay friends, possibly out of spite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's reaction was harsh and rejecting, which is really tough on the child. The author felt powerless and took this action, maybe as a form of emotional reaction. But was it right?\n\nOn one hand, the author is sharing personal family issues with others. The mom might not have wanted her friends to know about this, and the author is revealing that their parent is a homophobe. This could be seen as airing private family business, which might be considered a breach of privacy or trust. Even if the mom isn't a good person, the author is exposing her to her friends, which could damage relationships and is potentially unkind.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a vulnerable state, and the mom's actions were harmful. The author might feel justified in wanting to protect their own mental health or to warn others about the mom's behavior. However, sharing personal information without consent can be problematic regardless of the intent.\n\nThe key points are: the mom's behavior was unacceptable, the author acted out of hurt and anger, and the action involved sharing private information. While the mom's actions are deplorable, the author's response could still be seen as crossing a boundary. The friends might have a right to privacy regarding their friend's private family issues, even if the mom's views are negative.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal family matters without their mother's consent, even if it was in response to being hurt. The intent might be understandable, but the action itself could be considered a privacy violation. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
