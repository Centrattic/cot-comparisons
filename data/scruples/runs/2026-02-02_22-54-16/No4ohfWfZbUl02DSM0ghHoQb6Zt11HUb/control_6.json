She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author came out as gay to their mom, who had a negative reaction, saying they'd go to hell and not accepting them. Now the mom isn't responding. The author then told the mom's gay friends about the mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is hurt and angry. They felt powerless, so they reached out to the mom's friends to expose the mom's views. On one hand, the mom's actions are clearly problematic\u2014using religion to reject her child and being homophobic. On the other, the author went behind her back to share this information with others, even if they were friends of hers who are also gay.\n\nIs it right to spread someone's negative behavior? Well, if the author's intention was to protect others from the mom's homophobia, maybe there's a justification. But usually, people are advised to handle family issues privately. The author might have breached trust or privacy by disclosing personal family matters to the mom's friends. Also, the author was acting out of anger and hurt, which could cloud judgment.\n\nAnother angle: the author's mom has her own issues with her friends. If those friends knew about her beliefs, maybe they already had their own opinions. But the author's disclosure could have caused unnecessary conflict. However, the mom's friends are part of a marginalized group, and the author might feel that exposing the mom's true views is a form of advocacy for themselves and others.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the act of sharing someone's personal information without their consent, even if the content is negative, is often considered a breach of privacy. Unless there's an immediate harm, like abuse, sharing such information might not be justified. The author's mom has a right to privacy, even if her views are harmful. The author could have sought support elsewhere, like through counseling or support groups, without involving the mom's friends.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for breaching their mom's privacy, even with good intentions. The action could be seen as a form of retaliation rather than a constructive response. The right choice might have been to seek personal support while trying to maintain boundaries with the mom.\n"
