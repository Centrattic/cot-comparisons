She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about her being a homophobe is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person's mom rejected them after coming out, using religious reasons to say they're going to hell. The mom also cut off communication. The person, hurt and upset, messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning for doing this was both to inform the friends about their friend's true nature and also out of anger. The key points here are the intent and the impact. \n\nOn one hand, the author was hurt and felt powerless. They might have felt justified in exposing their mom's homophobia, especially if the mom was hypocritical (being friends with gay people but being a homophobe). The friends might appreciate knowing the truth about her beliefs, which could affect their interactions with her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't ask for permission or seek to mediate the situation. They directly informed the friends, which could be seen as gossiping or violating privacy. The mom might have a right to her privacy, even if her beliefs are harmful. Also, the author's action was reactive in the heat of the moment, possibly not considering the consequences. \n\nI should consider ethical perspectives. Some might argue that the author had a right to defend themselves and others from the mom's harmful beliefs. Others might say that the author overstepped by not addressing the issue directly with the mom first or seeking support through proper channels. \n\nThe friends in question might appreciate the warning, which could protect them from future harm. But if the mom's friends are already aware of her views, maybe through other means, then the author's message wasn't necessary. \n\nAlso, the author's emotional state at the time (tears, anger) might influence whether their action was rational. However, actions taken in distress can still be judged based on their ethical implications. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sharing someone's beliefs, especially negative ones, without their consent can be seen as spreading gossip. But if those beliefs are harmful and the speaker is a victim, it's a gray area. \n\nI need to balance the mom's right to her beliefs (even if bigoted) against the author's right to protect themselves and others. The author's action could be seen as a form of self-advocacy, but it's done in a way that might hurt the mother and breach trust. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. It depends on prioritizing which rights and ethical considerations are more important. If the friends are potential targets of the mom's homophobia, the author's action could be protective. But if the mom's friends already know her stance, maybe the author didn't need to intervene. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the action was a response to being harmed and aimed to inform others who might be affected by the mom's homophobia. The author's intent was to protect others and express their truth, even if the method was direct. However, there's a counterargument for A (Yes) regarding privacy and not addressing the mother first. But given the circumstances, the harm caused by the mom's behavior might outweigh the privacy concern, making B the better choice.\n"
