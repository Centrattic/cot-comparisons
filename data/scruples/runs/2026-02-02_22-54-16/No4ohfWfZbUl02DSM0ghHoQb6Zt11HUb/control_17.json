She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about the mother's reaction is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's mom reacted negatively, using religious reasons and cutting off contact. The author felt hurt and powerless, so they messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about the mother's homophobia.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether it's wrong for the author to have shared this information. On one hand, the author was upset and wanted to warn their mom's friends about her views. On the other, they might have breached confidentiality by sharing personal family matters without consent. \n\nThe mom's friends might not have known about her stance on being gay. The author's action could be seen as a way to protect the friends from being in a toxic situation, but it's also possible that the author overstepped by not discussing it with the mom first. However, the mom already cut off contact, so maybe there was no other way. \n\nBut was the author justified in sharing? Maybe they felt they had no other recourse. However, confronting the issue directly, even in a hurtful way, might not be the best approach. But considering the emotional state of the author, it might be understandable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was to inform the friends about their friend's true nature, which the author found out through personal experience. However, sharing someone's private views without their knowledge could be seen as gossiping or invading privacy. \n\nBut the mom's behavior was harmful, and the author wanted to protect the friends from similar treatment. The action was driven by self-defense and trying to protect others, but it's still a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's action was a reasonable response given the circumstances. If the mom's actions were harmful and the author felt they had no other option, maybe it's not entirely their fault. However, they did reveal private information without consent, which is a problem. \n\nIn many cases, sharing personal family issues to inform others about a person's true character can be seen as justified if done to prevent harm. But there's a line when it comes to respecting privacy. However, given the mom's behavior, the author might have had a valid reason. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes) because the author did share personal information without consent, which is a breach of trust. But the alternative is B (no), because the author was acting to protect others from similar harm. It's tricky. Maybe the majority opinion would lean towards A, considering the privacy breach. But if the intention was good, maybe B. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If we consider that the author's intent was to inform the friends about the mom's homophobia, which is a harmful position, maybe it's not entirely their fault. However, the act of sharing private family matters without consent is problematic. But given the context, maybe the answer is B (no). Alternatively, A (yes) because it's a breach of privacy regardless of intent. \n\nI think the key here is the intent versus the action. The action was a breach of privacy, but the intent was to protect others. However, in most ethical frameworks, sharing private information without consent is wrong, regardless of the motive. Therefore, the answer would be A. But maybe not everyone would agree. It's a tough call. But in terms of right and wrong, technically, the author did share something private, so they are in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
