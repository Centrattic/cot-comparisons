She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends about her rejection when they came out. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author came out to their mom, who is very religious, and she responded with rejection, saying they'd go to hell and that she's disappointed. She's not returning their calls, and the dad isn't either. The author is hurt and feels powerless. In their anger, they messaged some of the mom's gay friends (who the author knows are friends with her mom and are also gay), explaining the mom's homophobia and her rejection. The author's reasons were partly to inform the friends about their friend and also because they were upset.\n\nNow, I need to consider if this action was wrong. The key points here are: 1) Did the author cross a boundary by sharing their mom's private views without her consent? 2) Was the author justified in their actions given the context of their mom's homophobia towards other people too? 3) What are the potential consequences for everyone involved?\n\nOn one hand, the author was in a vulnerable state after being rejected. They might feel that their mom's behavior is hypocritical because she's friends with other gay people but still judges them. The author could be trying to protect those friends from similar rejection by warning them, especially if the mom is part of a community where others might be affected. Also, the author might see this as a way to stand up against the mom's harmful beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing their mother's personal views and actions without her consent could be seen as violating her privacy. The author is using their own hurt to spread information that could damage their mom's relationships. It's a form of retaliation, which might not be fair. Also, even if the mom's friends are gay, telling them about her rejection might not be something they need to know, and it could create tension or conflict that they don't want to be involved in. The author might not have considered how their friends would feel about this information or whether it's their place to share it.\n\nAnother angle: the author's mom is already causing harm by her homophobia. The author might feel that by informing the friends, they're holding her accountable. However, the method of doing so\u2014without consent\u2014could be problematic. It's possible that the friends already know or don't care, but the author's action might escalate the situation in a way that's unhelpful.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here, but morally and socially, it's a gray area. The author's intent was partly spiteful, which suggests they might regret it later. The friends might appreciate the heads-up, but they might also feel that it's none of the author's business. The author's mom might take offense, leading to more family strain.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, there's a balance between protecting oneself and respecting others' privacy. The author's action was a response to being hurt, but it's important to consider whether the right approach would be to seek support elsewhere or address the mom's behavior directly rather than spreading the information.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the author's action was to protect the friends from similar treatment, maybe not. But if it's about punishing the mom by spreading her private views, then maybe they are. The line between standing up against injustice and violating someone's privacy is thin here. The author's motivation matters. If they did it to protect the friends and raise awareness about their mom's hypocrisy, perhaps not. But if it's just to spite their mom, then yes. Given that the author mentions they were upset and did it in part in spite, it leans towards AITA being on the side of the author being in the wrong, but there's nuance. However, the community might have mixed reactions. Ultimately, I think the answer is a bit of both, but the question asks for A or B. Given that the action was against the mother's privacy and done in anger, maybe the answer is A. But considering the mom's own harmful behavior, maybe B. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A because sharing someone's private beliefs without consent is generally not okay, even if those beliefs are harmful.\n"
