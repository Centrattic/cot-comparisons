She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they came out as gay to their mom, and she had a bad reaction, saying they'd go to hell and not accepting them. Then the author told their mom's gay friends about her being a homophobe. The question is whether that makes the author the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author was hurt and upset, which is understandable. Coming out and being rejected by family can be really traumatic. They felt powerless and maybe acted out of anger or desperation. On the other hand, their mom is being a homophobe, which is definitely wrong. But the author went to her friends, who are part of the same community she discriminates against, and told them about her mom's views.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's mom had already expressed her homophobia, but maybe the friends didn't know the extent of it. By telling them, the author is exposing the mom's hypocrisy. But is it the author's place to do that? The author might feel justified because their mom is being harmful, but sharing personal family matters can be seen as crossing boundaries. Even if the mom is in the wrong, the author is airing their mom's views publicly, which could damage relationships. Also, considering the mom's friends, if they support the author's mom, they might cut ties, or if they share the same views, they might support the author. But the author might have acted out of anger rather than a constructive reason.\n\nAnother angle: the author was in a vulnerable state and did something impulsive. They might not have thought through the consequences. However, the mom's actions were harmful, so maybe the author had a right to express their feelings. But is it appropriate to involve others in a family matter? That's where it gets tricky. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between standing up for oneself and respecting family privacy. The author's action could be seen as protecting their own well-being by not keeping the abuse in the dark, but it's still sharing personal information. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. In many cases, family matters are considered private, and sharing them with others without consent can be seen as wrong, regardless of the content. However, if the mom's behavior is abusive, some might argue the author had a right to speak out. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, probably not, but socially or morally, it's debatable. The author's mom is clearly in the wrong, but the author's actions might have been vindictive or unwise. They acted on anger and hurt, which can lead to overstepping. Also, the author might not have considered how their mom's friends would react, leading to further conflict or hurting their mom, which isn't the author's responsibility to manage.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private family information without considering the broader implications, even if their mom's actions were harmful. It's important to address issues within the family without involving others unless necessary for support. The author could have sought other forms of support instead of exposing their mom's views directly to her friends.\n"
