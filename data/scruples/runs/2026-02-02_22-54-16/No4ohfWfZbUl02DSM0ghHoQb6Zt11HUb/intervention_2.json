She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends about the mother's rejection after coming out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who is very religious and didn't accept it, even threatening to send them to hell. The mom stopped communicating. The author, feeling hurt and angry, then told the mom's gay friends (a couple they've met before and are Facebook friends with) about the mom's homophobia and rejection. The author is now asking if they did the right thing.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. The answer should be A or B for yes/no.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing someone's private reactions to a family member's coming out can be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the content is negative. The author might have felt wronged and wanted to inform the friends about the mom's true beliefs, which the author perceives as hypocritical. The friends might have been unaware of the mom's stance, and the author might feel justified in exposing that.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as violating the mom's privacy. Even if the mom's actions are harmful, sharing that information without consent might be considered gossiping or spreading information that could damage relationships. The friends might feel betrayed if they trusted the mom, or it could create tension in the community, especially if the couple is known to be gay and the mom is part of their circle.\n\nAlso, the author's emotional state at the time (in tears, upset, acting in spite) might affect the judgment. They might not have been thinking clearly, and the action could be seen as impulsive rather than deliberate. However, emotional distress can sometimes be a mitigating factor in such situations.\n\nAnother angle: the mother's behavior is harmful and potentially abusive, especially given the religious context. The author might feel that protecting their own mental health is important, even if it means revealing the mom's words. If the friends are part of the same social network, they might have a right to know if their friend's actions are hypocritical, especially if the mom's attitudes could affect others.\n\nBut then again, the author could have approached the friends differently, perhaps in a more constructive way, like discussing how to support the author instead of just informing them of the mother's rejection. However, the author's primary goal was to inform the friends of the mom's true beliefs, which could be seen as a form of accountability.\n\nIn some contexts, calling out hypocrisy is seen as justified, but in personal relationships, it's more complicated. The friends might not have known the mother's stance, and the author's action could help them make informed decisions about their relationship with the mother. However, it's also possible that the author didn't consider the impact on their own relationship with the friends or the mother's privacy.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author's action might be seen as understandable given the harm caused by the mother, but it's still a breach of privacy. Whether it's \"wrong\" depends on the values of the community. Some might say the author was justified in exposing the mother's hypocrisy, others might say they should have kept it private. The key is whether the action was a necessary response to protect themselves or an overreach.\n\nGiven that the author was acting in a state of hurt and anger, and the mother's actions are harmful, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there are valid arguments for A as well. However, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and the question is whether the answer is A or B. Based on the analysis, the answer would be B."
