She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mother rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person came out to their mom, and the mom was very negative, religious, said they'd go to hell, and isn't accepting. The mom has friends who are gay, and the author knows that the mom is also bigoted towards them. So the author, feeling hurt and angry, messaged these friends to inform them about their mom's rejection and homophobia.\n\nThe question is whether this action is wrong. From a moral perspective, maybe the author felt justified because they were hurt and wanted their mom's friends to know the truth. But from another angle, maybe the author crossed a line by spreading their mom's private opinions and actions without her consent.\n\nI should consider ethics here. Telling someone else's secrets, even if they're friends, without permission could be seen as a breach of privacy. The mom's views are her own, but sharing them without her consent might be invading her privacy. Even if the author believes the mom is wrong, they might not have the right to disclose her reactions to others. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation: they were upset and wanted to protect their mom's friends from her prejudice. But is that a valid reason? Maybe the friends already knew their friend is intolerant, but the author is now sharing the extent of it. Could this cause the friends to distance themselves from the mom, which might be a consequence the author wants to avoid. But is it right to inform others about someone's private behavior?\n\nAnother angle: the author was vulnerable and acting out of emotional pain. They might not have considered the repercussions. However, the action was targeted at the mom's friends and involved sharing personal family matters. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong for breaching their mother's privacy, even if the content is about her own prejudices. The mom's friends might not appreciate being told this by their mutual child. The author could have sought advice or support elsewhere instead of informing the friends directly.\n"
