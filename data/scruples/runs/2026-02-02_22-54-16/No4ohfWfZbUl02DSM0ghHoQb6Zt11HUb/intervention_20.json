She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay to their mom and then told her gay friends about her rejection is in the wrong. The mom was religious, rejected the person, and isn't responding. The person felt hurt and angry, then messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's reaction was harsh\u2014calling her child to hell, disapproval, not accepting them or a partner. The person felt powerless and upset. They reached out to the mom's friends to share the truth about her homophobia, possibly to defend themselves or warn the friends about her stance.\n\nNow, the key points are: Did the author have the right to inform the friends? Was it a justified action given the emotional state? The mom's friends are also gay, so they might have been unaware of her true feelings. The author's intent was partly to inform and partly spiteful. \n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing someone's private behavior without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the person is wronged, retaliating by exposing others might not be the best approach. However, considering the mom's friends are part of the same community and the mom's hypocrisy (being friends with gay people but being homophobic), maybe the author felt it was important for them to know. \n\nBut the author was in an emotional state, so the action might have been impulsive. The question is whether this sharing was justified. The friends have a right to know if their friend is being hypocritical, but the author didn't ask for permission. However, the mom's behavior is harmful and the author might feel justified in protecting others from her.\n\nBalancing these factors, some might say the author was within their rights to protect themselves and others from the mom's hypocrisy. Others might argue that it's not their place to out someone's private views. But given the context of being rejected and the mom's actions, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), as the action was a response to hurt and a way to inform others of hypocrisy, even if done in anger.\n"
