She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about her rejection is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person came out to their mom, who had a very negative reaction, rejecting them and being religious. The mom didn't accept them and stopped communicating. Then the person, feeling hurt and angry, messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The user already thinks the author isn't, but they want others' opinions. \n\nI should consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author was hurt and upset. They might have felt justified in sharing the truth about their mom's beliefs with those she's friends with. But on the other hand, did the author have the right to disclose their mother's views to others, especially if those friends weren't directly involved?\n\nPrivacy is a factor. The mom's beliefs are her own, and sharing them without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, the mom's actions affected the author's life, so the author might feel it's a matter of self-defense or protecting their own relationships. \n\nAlso, the mom's friends might appreciate knowing the truth, especially if they're part of the LGBTQ+ community. If the mom claims to befriend them but holds opposing views, the author's disclosure might be a way to hold her accountable. But could this lead to conflict between the families or the friends?\n\nAnother angle: the author was acting out of anger and hurt. Emotional state can influence actions, but that doesn't necessarily excuse them. However, in some cases, people might argue that when faced with rejection and a lack of support, they act in self-preservation.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. If the mom's friends find out through the author, it might cause tension. But if they had asked the author about their mom's stance, the author might have shared similar information. The key is whether the author overstepped by proactively informing them without being asked.\n\nIn ethical terms, honesty is important, but so is respecting others' privacy. The author had a right to be honest about their mom's rejection, but maybe they should have considered the impact on their mom and the relationship with the friends. \n\nI think the answer could be B (No) because the author was sharing their personal experience and the truth about their mom's beliefs, which could help others make informed decisions about their relationships. However, others might argue that it's meddling in family affairs and disrespecting boundaries. \n\nBut considering the context, the author's action might be seen as a justified expression of their hurt and a way to protect their own relationships, especially since the mom's views were hypocritical. The friends might appreciate knowing the truth. So leaning towards B (No).\n"
