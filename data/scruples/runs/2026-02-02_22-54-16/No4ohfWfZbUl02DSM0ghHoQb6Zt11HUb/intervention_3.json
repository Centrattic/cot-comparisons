She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. The mom is religious and didn't take it well, leading the author to feel hurt and isolated. The author then shared this information with the mom's gay friends, possibly as a reaction to their own pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a vulnerable state after being rejected by their parent. They might have felt a need to reach out to others who understand the situation. The mom had friends who are gay, but she still holds negative views towards them. The author informed these friends about the mom's homophobia and rejection.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, sharing personal family matters can be sensitive. But in this case, the author was sharing their experience to connect with people who might have faced similar issues. They were also informing these friends about the mother's true beliefs, which might have been hidden. The author's intention could be seen as both self-expression and an act of seeking support. However, there's a line where sharing private family issues without consent might be crossing into gossip or damaging others. But given that the author is the one who was harmed and is sharing their truth with others who are directly affected (the mom's friends who are gay), it's more about transparency with people who might have been unaware of the mom's stance. The mom's friends might have a right to know if they are associating with someone who harbors such views, especially if the mom didn't express them openly. The author's action could be seen as a form of self-defense or protecting others from potential harm in their relationships. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
