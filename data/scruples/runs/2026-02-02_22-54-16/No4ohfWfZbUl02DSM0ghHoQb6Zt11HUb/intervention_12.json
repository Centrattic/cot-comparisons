She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author coming out to their mom, who reacted negatively, calling them to hell and refusing to accept them. The mom isn't responding, so the author is hurt and angry. Then, the author messages the mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's rejection and her homophobia, essentially warning them about her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is dealing with a traumatic situation, rejection from family, which is a big deal. They might be feeling isolated and seeking support. But they took the information to the friends of their mother, which could be seen as spreading gossip or even doxxing. Even though the mom's friends are also part of the LGBTQ+ community, the author's action might have breached privacy.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author have the right to inform the friends about their mother's views? Privacy is a big factor. The author's mom might not have intended for her friends to know her stance, even if they are aware indirectly. The author might have done it out of emotional distress and a need to be validated. But is it justified? \n\nOn one hand, the author felt wronged and powerless. On the other hand, sharing personal family matters without consent could be seen as crossing a line. The friends might appreciate knowing the truth, but the method and intent matter. Was it to protect the friends from potential hypocrisy, or was it more about the author's anger?\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but morally and socially, it's a gray area. The author's action could be seen as taking a stand against their mom's hypocrisy, but it could also be seen as violating trust. The friends might have already known their friend's views, but the direct message from the author could cause tension. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's action might be understandable given the context, but it's not without fault. The answer depends on whether the act of informing others without consent is considered wrong. Some might say it's justified as the mom is being hypocritical, while others would say it's a privacy breach. The user said they think the author isn't wrong, but I need to decide based on analysis.\n"
