She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person came out as gay and faced a negative reaction from their mom, who is religious and doesn't accept it. The mom rejected them, stopped communication, and the person felt hurt and powerless. In their anger, they told the mom's gay friends about her homophobia.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the person is in the wrong for informing their mom's friends about her stance. On one hand, the mom has friends who are gay, and she's known to disapprove of their lifestyle. The person shared this info, which might have been a way to hold the mom accountable, especially since those friends might not know the extent of her views. But did they have the right to do so without the mom's consent?\n\nThe person was upset and maybe acted out of spite. But they were also trying to protect their own mental health and possibly the friends from similar treatment. However, sharing personal information without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the intention was good, it's about respecting boundaries. The mom might feel that her private views were exposed without her knowledge. \n\nBut then again, the mom's actions (rejecting her child, not accepting them) are part of the conflict. The person might feel justified in defending themselves. The friends might need to know to decide how to interact with the mom. It's a tough call. The person's actions could be seen as understandable under the circumstances, but technically, sharing someone's private beliefs without their consent is still a privacy issue. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because of the privacy breach, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to the context of being rejected. Need to decide where the balance lies here.\n"
