She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author came out as gay to their mom, who reacted badly, calling them to hell and disowning them. The mom isn't responding. The author, hurt and angry, told some of the mom's gay friends about the mom's homophobia and rejection. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author was hurt and feeling powerless. They might have wanted to confront the mom's hypocrisy since the mom has gay friends but is homophobic. But is it okay to out someone or share personal family issues with others without permission? The mom's friends might not want to know that their friend holds such views, even if those views are harmful. The author might be trying to protect those friends from a toxic relationship, but they didn't ask the friends if they wanted that info. It could be seen as interfering in their relationship with their friend. Also, the author is sharing their mom's private reactions, which might not be their place. Even if the mom is a homophobe, the author is airing family business outside the family. It's a breach of privacy. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't have the right to share that information with others. They could have expressed their feelings to their mom, but if that's not working, maybe they should seek support elsewhere instead of informing the mom's friends. But the author's intention was to highlight hypocrisy. Still, the method might be inappropriate. So I think the answer is A.\n"
