She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. The mom is described as religious, not accepting, and has cut off contact. The author felt hurt and powerless, then reached out to these friends to share the mom's homophobia.\n\nSo, first, the author was in a tough spot. Coming out and facing rejection, especially from family, is super stressful. The mom's reaction was harsh, which adds to the emotional distress. The author decided to inform her friends about her mom's views. Now, the question is if that was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because they were hurt and wanted to share their experience. The mom's friends are gay, and she's supposedly judgmental towards them. By telling them, the author might be trying to protect them from future interactions with someone who holds those views. But on the other hand, did the author have the right to share personal family issues without the mom's consent? \n\nThere's a balance between self-expression and respecting others' privacy. The author might be venting, but sharing this with the friends could be seen as airing family business. Also, the author was in a vulnerable state, which might have clouded their judgment. \n\nHowever, considering the mom's behavior towards the author and others, the author might argue that they were exposing the truth to those affected. But is it their place to do that? The author's actions could be seen as a way to cope, but maybe not the most constructive one. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a difference between sharing with close friends and strangers. The author's friends (the mom's friends) weren't part of the initial conflict. The author might not have considered how sharing this info could affect their mom's relationships. However, given the mom's stance, the author might feel it's important for those friends to know the reality.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the author was hurt, acting from a place of anger and vulnerability, and the information shared is about someone else's views. While it's understandable, it's debatable whether they overstepped. But since the mom was already judgmental towards others, maybe it's a form of truth-telling. \n\nHmm, the answer is complicated. But the user said they think the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A and B. The key factors are intent and context. The author's intent was to share their experience and possibly warn others about a homophobe. The context is a family conflict where the mom's behavior is harmful. In such cases, people might argue that the author isn't in the wrong, especially if they were protecting others from similar treatment. So, B might be the answer here.\n"
