She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that she rejected them when the author came out as gay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction. The mom said they were going to hell and wouldn't accept them. The author is hurt and feels powerless. In response, they messaged a couple of their mom's gay friends, informing them that the mom is a homophobe and that she rejected her child. The author is seeking validation on whether this action was wrong.\n\nI need to consider the context. The mom's reaction is clearly harmful and discriminatory. The author is sharing this information with friends of the mom, who are also part of the LGBTQ+ community. The question is about the ethics of the author's action. On one hand, the mom's friends might already be aware of her beliefs, but the author is directly telling them. Is that justified?\n\nThe author's intent is important here. They did it partly because they were upset and wanted to inform the friends about their mom's stance. But does that give them the right to share personal information? The mom's friends are her acquaintances, not necessarily the author's. Sharing such details could be seen as violating the mom's privacy or crossing boundaries, even if the information is harmful. However, the mom's homophobia is a serious issue affecting the author, and the friends might be close, so the author could feel it's important to protect themselves and possibly influence the friends' perception of the mom.\n\nAnother angle: the couple is already gay, so maybe they can handle the information. But what if the mom didn't want her personal beliefs shared with others? The author is exposing their family's private matters. However, the mom's behavior is harmful, and the friends might not be aware of how her actions affect her family. The author could argue that they're being honest and that the friends should know the reality of her stance.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The author is dealing with emotional distress and wants to express their pain. But is it appropriate to inform others about a parent's private reaction? In some cases, people might feel justified if the parent's behavior is abusive. On the other hand, it could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the author was supposed to be a neutral party in their mom's social circle.\n\nI think the key points are the mom's harmful behavior and the author's intent. If the friends were close or if the mom's beliefs affected their interactions, maybe it's okay. But if the author is airing their family's dirty laundry without the mom's consent, that's a problem. However, given the mom's homophobia and the fact that the friends are part of the same community she criticizes, the author might be trying to protect themselves and align their social circle with like-minded people.\n\nSo, considering all this, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong, as they were acting out of pain and possibly trying to find support. But there's a nuance here. The answer might depend on cultural or personal norms. However, since the mom's behavior is clearly the issue, and the author is sharing their experience, maybe it's a justified act of self-preservation.\n"
