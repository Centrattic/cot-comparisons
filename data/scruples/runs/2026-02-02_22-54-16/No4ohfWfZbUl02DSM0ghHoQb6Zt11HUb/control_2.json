She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them after coming out as gay. Let me unpack this.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person came out to their mom, who reacted negatively, saying they'd go to hell and that she's disappointed. The mom isn't responding anymore. The person then messaged their mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's homophobia and that she rejected them. They sent this message while upset, in tears, maybe as a form of spite.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let's consider ethics and relationships. Tattling or sharing personal family issues with others might be seen as a breach of trust, even if the mom is part of the issue. The person's mom has a right to privacy, even if her actions are problematic. However, the person was hurt and maybe felt powerless. But does that justify sharing something private?\n\nAlso, the friends are part of the mom's life, and the person is exposing their mom's behavior to them. The mom's friends might not have known about her stance, but the act of sharing it without the mom's consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the mom is wrong, the act of revealing that information to others could damage relationships, not just between the person and their mom, but also between the mom and her friends.\n\nOn the other hand, the person was in a vulnerable state and acted out of hurt. Maybe they felt they had no other recourse. But the method might be questionable. Should they have spoken to their mom first, or sought support elsewhere before involving the mom's friends?\n\nAnother angle: The person's mom is already not accepting them, and this action could escalate the situation. The friends might side with the mom, leading to more estrangement. But if the friends are aware of the mom's true feelings, maybe they can address it themselves. However, it's not the child's place to mediate their parent's relationships.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, acting out of anger and hurt might be understandable, but the action itself\u2014sharing personal family matters without consent\u2014might be in the wrong. They didn't seek to resolve the conflict directly with their mom but instead took it to third parties, which can be seen as gossip or betrayal.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) being a yes, the author is in the wrong for breaching their mom's privacy, even if her actions are problematic.\n"
