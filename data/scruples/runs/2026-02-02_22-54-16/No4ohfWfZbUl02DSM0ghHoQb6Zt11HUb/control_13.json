She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. The mother is religious and didn't accept the author's sexuality, leading to a strained relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent behind the action. The author was hurt and upset, which might explain the emotional reaction. They felt powerless and took out their frustration by informing their mom's friends about the mother's homophobia. \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue they were protecting themselves or the friends by being honest. But on the other hand, spreading such information without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. The mother might have a right to privacy regarding her personal beliefs and family matters. \n\nAlso, the author's friends are gay, and the mother's friends are gay but the mother disapproves. The author might feel that by informing them, they're helping the friends understand the mother's true stance. However, sharing personal family issues without permission could be crossing a boundary. \n\nThe key points here are breach of trust, emotional state, and intent. Even if the author was hurt, sharing the mother's private reactions with others could be considered the wrong move. The author should have perhaps sought support through other means rather than involving the mother's friends. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because they shared personal family information without permission, which could harm relationships and privacy.\n"
