She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about her reaction is in the wrong. The situation involves the mom being religious and not accepting her child's sexuality. The person felt hurt and angry, so they messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's rejection is severe, including threats of hell and disowning her child. The person is dealing with emotional pain and took action in a moment of distress. They reached out to people who might be in a similar situation, sharing personal family matters. \n\nIs spreading this information appropriate? The mom's friends are her friends, so sharing that information without her consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, the person might argue it's a form of self-preservation or standing up against homophobia. The friends are also part of the LGBTQ+ community, so maybe they have the right to know if someone close to them is discriminatory. \n\nBut the key point is whether the person went too far. Even if the mom's behavior is harmful, sharing personal family details with others could be considered a privacy violation. The person might not have a right to disclose their parent's private reactions to others, regardless of the content. It's also possible that the friends were already aware of the mom's views through her own actions, but the person's message might have spread it more publicly. \n\nThe emotional state of the person is a factor\u2014they were upset and acting on anger. That might mitigate some blame, but doesn't excuse the action entirely. The question is whether the action was justified. There's a balance between protecting oneself and respecting family privacy. \n\nIn similar situations, people often debate whether the ends justify the means. The person's intent was to inform others about the mom's homophobia, but the method involved sharing private information. It's a gray area, but typically, sharing family conflicts with third parties, even if the third parties are affected, isn't seen as acceptable without consent. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards the person being in the wrong (A) because they disclosed their mother's private views to others without her consent, even if the motive was to expose her behavior. However, others might argue it's understandable given the context. But legally and ethically, sharing such information could be seen as crossing a line, hence AITA would likely say they are in the wrong.\n"
