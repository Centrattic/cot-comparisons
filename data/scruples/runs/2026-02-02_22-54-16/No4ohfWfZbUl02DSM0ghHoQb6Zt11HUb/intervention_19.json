She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out. The mom is religious, didn't accept the kid's sexuality, and is now cutting off contact. The person, feeling hurt and upset, messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The mom's reaction was harsh, even though it was expected. The kid is hurt and maybe acting out of anger. The mom has friends who are gay, and the kid told them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe. \n\nNow, is the kid at fault here? Well, the mom's friends have a right to know if the mom is spreading negativity about them or holding harmful beliefs. But the kid didn't ask the mom for permission to share this. However, the mom's friends might already know about her views through her own actions. The kid is sharing personal information about the mom's rejection, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. On the other hand, the kid is also protecting themselves and maybe trying to help the friends know the truth about someone they consider a friend.\n\nBut wait, is it the kid's place to act as the messenger? Even if the mom's friends are gay and the mom is a homophobe, the kid is revealing private family matters. The kid might have felt justified because the mom was being hypocritical, but sharing that without the mom's consent could be seen as crossing a line. The kid's action might have been a reaction to hurt and anger, which can cloud judgment. \n\nAlso, the mom's friends might have already had some inkling about her beliefs, but the kid is directly telling them that she rejected them. The kid's intention was to inform the friends about their friend's true stance, which could be seen as a good intention, but the method of sharing personal family issues might be inappropriate. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the kid is standing up for themselves and being honest about the mom's behavior. But others might say that the kid should have handled it differently, maybe by confronting the mom first or seeking support elsewhere. \n\nSo, balancing the hurt feelings and the breach of privacy, maybe the kid isn't entirely wrong, but there's a question about the method. However, the answer seems to lean towards the kid not being in the wrong because they were informing others about harmful behavior, even if it's their parent. The mom's actions are problematic, and the kid is trying to protect themselves and perhaps the friends from being manipulated. \n\nBut I need to make sure. The key points are the mom's homophobia, the kid's hurt, and sharing private info. The kid's action was in response to rejection and to inform friends about the mom's true nature. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the kid isn't in the wrong here because they were defending themselves and others from a harmful person. So the answer might be B.\n"
