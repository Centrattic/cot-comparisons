She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling her mom's gay friends that her mom rejected her when she came out. The author's mom is religious, didn't accept her being gay, said they'd go to hell, and stopped communicating. The author, feeling hurt and angry, reached out to her mom's gay friends to inform them about her mom's homophobia.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The mom's rejection was pretty harsh, religious-based, and led to a breakdown in communication. The author felt powerless and upset. She then messaged her mom's gay friends, telling them about her mom's stance. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because she's sharing the truth about her mom's homophobia, especially since the mom is friends with other LGBTQ+ individuals but holds negative views. The author could argue that these friends have a right to know that their friend perpetuates harmful beliefs, even if they're unaware.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's mom hasn't shared this information with her friends herself. The author is essentially disclosing private family matters without permission. That could be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the mom is a homophobe, the author's friends might not appreciate being told by a family member's child without their consent.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. She was upset and possibly acting out of spite. While the intent might have been to inform others about a potential issue, sharing such personal information might not be the best approach. It could strain her mom's relationships and possibly lead to more conflict within the family.\n\nBut then, considering the mom's behavior, which is harmful and harmful to the author, there's an argument that the friends have a right to know the truth about their friend's true beliefs, which might affect any future interactions. However, the method of disclosure here is through the author, not the mom herself. The author might not have the authority to share her mom's private opinions with others.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between honesty and respect for privacy. The author might not be in the wrong if her intent was to protect others from the mom's harmful views, but the method could be problematic. Alternatively, she could be in the wrong for violating her mom's privacy and inserting herself into her mom's relationships without permission.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The mom's actions were harmful and discriminatory, but 2) The author shared private information without consent. The mom's behavior is bad, but the author's action might be crossing a line by using her mom's friends to vent or inform them without her mom's knowledge. So, the author might be in the wrong because she shared personal family matters without permission, even if the content is true. Privacy and consent are important here.\n"
