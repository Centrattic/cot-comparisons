She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them when they came out as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who reacted negatively, saying they'd go to hell and not accepting them. The mom isn't responding, and the author is hurt. Then, the author messaged the mom's gay friends, explaining what happened and basically outed the mom's homophobia to them.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is sharing private family information with others, specifically the mom's friends. The mom is friends with gay people, but the author isn't sure if the mom is open about her views to them. The author's message was to inform these friends about the mom's true feelings, which might be a betrayal of trust.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a privacy perspective, sharing a parent's private reactions without their consent could be seen as wrong. Even if the mom is a homophobe, the author is revealing her stance to others, which might harm their relationships. The author's motivation was hurt and anger, which could justify the action in their eyes, but does that make it right?\n\nAlso, the mom's friends are gay, and the author is informing them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe. That might be a form of outting the mom, which is generally considered harmful. Outting someone without their consent can lead to social consequences for the person being outed. In this case, the author is outing their mom to her friends, which could damage the mom's relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that these friends deserve to know if their friend holds such views, especially if they are part of the LGBTQ+ community. However, even if the mom's views are harmful, spreading that information without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of confidentiality.\n\nI should also consider the intent. The author was acting out of hurt and anger, which are understandable emotions. But does that excuse the action? In terms of ethics, acting out of negative emotions doesn't necessarily make the action right, especially when it involves sharing sensitive information about someone else.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was a betrayal of trust or if there were extenuating circumstances. Here, the author's action could be seen as a betrayal of their mom's trust, even if the mom was wrong in her reaction. The friends might feel betrayed if they knew the author shared that information, even if they agree with the author.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely did something wrong by sharing their mom's private stance without her consent, even if the mom's behavior was problematic. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they breached their mother's privacy and potentially damaged relationships without a clear justification.\n"
