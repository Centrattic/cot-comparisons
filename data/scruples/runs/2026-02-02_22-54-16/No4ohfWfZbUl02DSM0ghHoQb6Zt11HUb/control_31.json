She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person came out as gay, their mom rejected them, and then they told their mom's gay friends about her homophobia. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's reaction was pretty harsh\u2014religious condemnation, disownment, not speaking to her child. That's a tough situation. The child felt hurt and powerless, leading them to act out of anger. They messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about her stance. \n\nSo, is this the right move? On one hand, the mom's behavior is definitely harmful and wrong. The child is dealing with a lot of emotional distress here. But the action taken by the child was to spread information about their parent's homophobia to others. \n\nNow, the key point here is whether this action was justified. The child might be feeling wronged and trying to protect their mom's friends from her behavior. But sharing someone's private beliefs, especially in a hurtful way, could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the parent is at fault, the child's action could be considered a breach of privacy or trust. \n\nThe mom might have her own issues, but the child could be in the wrong for airing family matters publicly. The friends might not have wanted to know about this, and the child's message could be seen as gossip or an attempt to damage the parent's relationships. However, the intent here is important. The child's intent was to inform the friends about the mom's true nature, which could be seen as trying to protect the friends from being harmed by her. \n\nBut, in most cases, exposing someone's beliefs without their consent, even if those beliefs are harmful, can be problematic. The child might not have the right to share their parent's views to others without her permission. It's a delicate balance between standing up against injustice and respecting boundaries. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, while the mom's actions are condemnable, the child's method of addressing it might not be the best approach. There could be better ways to handle the situation, like seeking support elsewhere without involving others in this manner. \n\nSo, considering the intent and the action, the child might be in the wrong for sharing their parent's private views with others, even if the parent is being harmful. The right to privacy and the potential harm caused by such exposure should be considered. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to be careful here.\n"
