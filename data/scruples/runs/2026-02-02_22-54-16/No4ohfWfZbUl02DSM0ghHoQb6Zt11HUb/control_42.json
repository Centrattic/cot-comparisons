She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about her rejection is in the wrong. The mom reacted negatively, calling them to hell and being dismissive. The person felt hurt and then messaged their mom's gay friends to inform them about the mom's homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom is religious and has a history of being intolerant towards gay people. The person felt powerless and hurt, so they lashed out by sharing this information. The question is whether that action was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, spreading someone's personal information without their consent, even if it's about their beliefs, can be seen as a breach of trust. The person might have crossed a boundary by sharing their mom's views with others who are close to her. It could damage relationships and might not be fair to the mom's friends if they weren't aware of her true feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the person was in emotional distress and felt wronged. They might have felt justified in wanting to warn the friends about their friend's hypocrisy, especially if the mom was being outwardly homophobic but had gay friends. There's an argument that they were trying to protect the friends from being hurt or to inform them of the mom's true stance, which they believed was harmful.\n\nBut is it the person's place to do that? Typically, airing someone's private beliefs or actions to others without their consent can be seen as gossiping, even if the content is negative. The person might have been acting out of anger and hurt, which can cloud judgment. The mom's friends might not appreciate being told about their friend's private comments, especially if the person isn't in a position to mediate that relationship. \n\nSo, while the person's feelings are valid and the mom's reaction is unacceptable, the act of informing the friends without consent might be considered crossing a line. It's possible that the person could have sought support in a different way, like talking to a counselor or a neutral party, rather than sharing personal information. Therefore, the person might be in the wrong for that action, even if their motivations were rooted in pain.\n"
