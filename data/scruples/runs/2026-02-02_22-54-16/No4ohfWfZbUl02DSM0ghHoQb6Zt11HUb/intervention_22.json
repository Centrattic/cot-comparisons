She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about the mom's homophobia is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, the context: The author's mom rejected them after they came out, using strong religious arguments and refusing to accept them. The mom also has gay friends, but the author found out that the mom is actually a homophobe. The author, hurt and upset, messaged these friends to inform them about their mom's true feelings.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author was in emotional distress and felt betrayed, especially since the mom had friends who are part of the LGBTQ+ community but still holds prejudiced views. The author's action could be seen as a way to protect their own mental health and also inform others about a friend's true nature.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing personal family matters without permission might breach privacy. The author didn't ask for the mom's consent, which could be an issue. But given the context, the mom was already not supportive, and the author was trying to protect themselves from further harm.\n\nAlso, the friends in question are part of a marginalized group that the mom supposedly supports but actually doesn't. The author's message could be seen as a necessary action to expose hypocrisy. However, there's a line between standing up for oneself and spreading potentially damaging information.\n\nBut considering the emotional state of the author and the mom's rejection, the act might be more about self-preservation. The friends might appreciate knowing the truth about their friend, especially if they were unaware of her true stance. However, if the author's message was harsh or untrue, that's different. But the scenario suggests it was a factual account of the mom's rejection.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a debate about privacy versus protection. The author might not be in the wrong because they were acting in their own interest and also protecting others from potential hypocrisy. Alternatively, sharing without consent is generally frowned upon, but the context complicates that.\n\nI think the key points are the mom's rejection, the author's emotional state, and the potential hypocrisy of the mom towards her friends. The author's action was likely a mix of self-defense and informing others about a friend's true beliefs, which might not be in the wrong. So I'm leaning towards B.\n"
