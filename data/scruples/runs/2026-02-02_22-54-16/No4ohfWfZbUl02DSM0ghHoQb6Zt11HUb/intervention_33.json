She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author came out as gay to their mom, who had a bad reaction, including being religious and rejecting them. The author then told their mom's gay friends about her homophobia, which made them feel upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the mother's rejection and the author's response. The mother is described as very religious, which led to her not accepting her child's sexuality and even rejecting them. The author felt hurt and powerless, so they reached out to the mom's friends, explaining the situation and revealing the mother's views. The author's intent here is a bit mixed\u2014partly to inform the friends about their friend's true nature and partly from anger or spite due to their own hurt.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother's actions are clearly harmful and hurtful. The author was in a vulnerable state after being rejected. Telling someone's friends about their private behavior might seem like a breach of privacy or trust, but in this case, the mother's actions are public in a sense because her friends might be aware of her beliefs, but maybe not the extent of her rejection towards her own child.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by informing the mother's friends. The mother's friends are gay, so they might be the ones who could be affected by the mother's homophobia. The author might have thought that they should know the truth about their friend, especially if the mother was pretending to be okay with them while actually holding prejudiced views. However, the author didn't necessarily have the mother's consent to share this information. \n\nBut considering the context, the author was in emotional distress and felt wronged. The act of coming out and facing rejection can be traumatic, and the author's response might be seen as a form of self-preservation or protection of others who might be affected by the mother's behavior. However, the author might have crossed a line by sharing personal family matters without considering the potential consequences for their relationship with their mother or others.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's actions are the root of the problem. She rejected her child based on prejudice, which is a serious issue. The author's disclosure could be seen as a way to hold the mother accountable for her actions, especially if the friends are unaware of her true stance. The friends might appreciate knowing the reality of their friend's beliefs, even if it's uncomfortable. However, the method of disclosure\u2014directly messaging them without context or perhaps without the mother's knowledge\u2014could be problematic. It might damage the mother's relationships or lead to backlash against the author from the friends.\n\nBut given the emotional state of the author, there's a case that they were acting out of hurt and a desire to protect others from a homophobe, even if the method was not the best. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough one. If we consider the mother's wrongdoing as the catalyst, maybe the author's actions are excusable. However, if we look at it from a standpoint of privacy and trust, the author might have overstepped. But given the circumstances, many might argue that the author was justified in wanting to inform others about the mother's harmful beliefs, especially if those others are part of the LGBTQ+ community and could be affected by the mother's views. So, perhaps the answer is that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
