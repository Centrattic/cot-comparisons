She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that the mom rejected them when they came out. The mom is religious, didn't accept the child's sexuality, and the child felt hurt and powerless, so they messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The person did come out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, leading to hurt feelings. When upset, they reached out to the mom's friends (who are gay) to share the mom's stance. The key points here are intent and the impact of their actions.\n\nThe author's intent was partly to inform the friends about their friend's homophobia, which might have been a way to seek support or warn them. But since the friends might already be aware of the mom's beliefs through her, or maybe not, it's unclear. However, the act of sharing private family matters, especially in a vulnerable state, could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. The child might have felt justified in protecting their own mental health and that of others, but airing family business to others without consent could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's actions were harmful, and the child might feel that the friends should know the truth about her homophobia. However, the child's method of communication (sending a message in tears) might not have considered the potential consequences or the friends' right to privacy. It's possible that the friends were already aware of the mom's views, but the child's disclosure could have escalated tensions or caused unnecessary conflict.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the mom's behavior is clearly hurtful, the child's response might not be the right approach. The child could have sought support through other means, like talking to a counselor, joining a support group, or using online resources. Spreading the information to the mom's friends might be seen as gossip or betrayal of the family's private issues, even if the intent was to protect others from the mom's harmful attitudes.\n\nAnother angle is the potential harm to the relationship between the mom and her friends. If the friends value her, they might now feel conflicted, especially if they weren't aware of her true feelings. The child's action could strain or end those relationships, which the child might not have intended but could be a consequence.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between self-advocacy and respecting others' privacy. The child's decision to inform the friends might cross into the latter, as they are sharing personal family dynamics without considering the friends' perspectives or the mom's right to privacy. However, if the friends were in a position to support the child, maybe the child felt justified.\n\nBut generally, in such situations, experts often advise against airing family issues publicly, even if the intent is to seek support. It's usually recommended to focus on one's own healing and seek help through appropriate channels. Therefore, the child might be in the wrong for not handling it more privately, even if their feelings are valid.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because sharing private family information, especially in a vulnerable and emotional state, without considering the broader implications, is ethically questionable. The intent might be understandable, but the action breaches privacy and could cause further harm.\n"
