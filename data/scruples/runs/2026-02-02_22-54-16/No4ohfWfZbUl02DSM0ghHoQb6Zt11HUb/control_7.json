She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their mom's gay friends that she rejected them when they came out as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author came out to their mom, who had a negative reaction, mentioning religion and not accepting their sexuality. The mom isn't responding, and the author is hurt. Then, the author messaged the mom's gay friends, sharing the mom's homophobia and the rejection. The author's motivation seems to be a mix of wanting to inform the friends about their mom's true views and acting out of anger.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are intent and the impact of their actions. The author's message to the friends could be seen as a betrayal of confidentiality. Even though the mom's friends might already suspect she's judgmental, the author is directly sharing personal information about their mom's reaction without her consent. \n\nOn one hand, the author is hurt and possibly seeking support or validation. The friends might benefit from knowing that someone close to them holds these views. On the other hand, spreading personal family matters without consent can damage trust. The author didn't confront the mom directly or seek to mediate the situation, which might be a better approach. \n\nIn terms of ethics, confidentiality is important. While the message might be truthful, the method of sharing it is a breach of privacy. The author didn't ask the mom's permission and didn't consider the potential consequences, like the friends feeling upset or the family relationship being further strained. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a way to vent their anger, which might not make the action right. Even if the mom's homophobia is problematic, the author's decision to inform the friends without their mom's consent is ethically questionable. \n\nHowever, there's an argument that the friends might deserve to know if their friend is spreading harmful beliefs. But the author's method of communication\u2014sending a message without context or invitation\u2014could be seen as harmful as well. \n\nConsidering all this, the author did act in a way that breaches trust and confidentiality, even if motivated by hurt feelings. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
