She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by telling their mom's gay friends that their mom rejected them and is a homophobe. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author came out as gay and their mom had a negative reaction, even saying things like going to hell and being disappointed. The mom isn't accepting and hasn't been communicating. The author is hurt and upset. Then, the author messaged some of their mom's gay friends, explaining the mom's stance and revealing that she's a homophobe. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They're dealing with rejection from family, which is really tough. They might feel like they need to protect themselves or maybe seek support. But by informing their mom's friends about her views, they're potentially creating tension between their mom and her friends. The friends might feel betrayed or hurt if the mom finds out. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because their mom is being homophobic and they want to warn people who might be affected. On the other hand, they could be seen as spreading gossip or undermining their mom's relationships. The author was acting out of anger and hurt, which can cloud judgment. Even if the intention was to protect others or vent, sharing such personal family issues without considering the consequences might not be the best approach.\n\nAlso, the author's mom's behavior is definitely harmful, but the author's action could be seen as a breach of trust. Maybe the author should have sought support through other means, like talking to a counselor or reaching out to a support group instead of directly informing the mom's friends. \n\nSo, considering the intent, the method, and the potential impact, there's a case to be made that the author is in the wrong because they shared sensitive information without considering the consequences. But there's also empathy for the situation they're in. However, the question is specifically about whether they're in the wrong. I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because gossiping about family matters, even if hurt, can cause more harm and isn't a constructive solution.\n"
