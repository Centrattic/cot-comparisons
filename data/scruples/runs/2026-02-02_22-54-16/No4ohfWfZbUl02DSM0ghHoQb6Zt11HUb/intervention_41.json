She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who came out as gay and then told their mom's gay friends about her rejection) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The mom rejected her child when they came out, using religious reasons and refusing to accept them. The author felt hurt and powerless. In their emotional state, they messaged the mom's gay friends to inform them about her homophobia. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel justified in protecting their friends (the gay couple) from being misled, especially since the mom has friends who are part of the LGBTQ+ community but holds homophobic views. The author might see this as a way to be honest, especially since their mom didn't address the issue directly with her friends.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, the author didn't approach their mom first to address the issue. Instead, they went directly to the mom's friends, which could be seen as gossiping or violating privacy. The mom might argue that it's not the author's place to inform others about their parent's personal beliefs without consent.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but so is respecting boundaries. The author's action could be seen as a form of retaliation or a way to vent their anger. The friends of the mom might have a right to know if the mom's actions affect them, but the method of communication here was direct and potentially hurtful.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author's intention was to be truthful but their approach might have been inappropriate. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't try to resolve the issue with their mom first and instead took it out on her friends. However, some might argue that the author had a right to protect themselves and others from harm. But generally, the consensus in such situations is that approaching the person directly is better than going around them. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
