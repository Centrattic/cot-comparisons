She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post did the wrong thing by telling their mom's gay friends that she rejected them after they came out as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The mother's reaction was harsh, religious-based rejection, cutting off contact. The author felt hurt and powerless. Then, in a moment of anger and upset, they told the mom's gay friends about her homophobia.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author cross a line by sharing their mother's views with her friends? On one hand, the mother's actions were harmful and hurtful. The author might feel justified in seeking support or wanting to warn the friends about the mom's true feelings. On the other hand, the author is sharing personal family matters without the mother's consent. Even if the mother is at fault, the author is acting out of hurt and anger, which might not make their actions right.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between protecting oneself and respecting privacy. The mother's friends have a right to know if their friend is being hypocritical (being friends with gay people while holding homophobic views). However, the author took it upon themselves to out the mother's feelings, which could be seen as gossiping or violating trust. \n\nAlso, the author's intention matters. They wanted to inform the friends about the mother's true stance, possibly to protect the friends from similar rejection. But was it their place to do so? The mother's friends might have their own way of dealing with her if they knew, but the author might have overstepped by sharing without the mother's knowledge.\n\nIn many cases, even if someone is in the wrong, spreading their personal behaviors without consent can be seen as unethical. The author might have valid reasons, but the action of disclosing family issues to the mother's friends could be considered a breach of trust. So, the author is in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, even if the intent was to expose hypocrisy. The answer would be A.\n"
