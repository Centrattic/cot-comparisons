She told me I was going to Hell (she\u2019s very religious) and that she was so disappointed that this is the life I have chosen for myself. She also made it very clear that she would never accept me or any partner that I may have as legitimate. She hasn\u2019t been returning my texts or calls, and neither has my dad. \n\nNaturally I was really hurt by this, even though it\u2019s what I expected, although I certainly hoped for a better reaction. I felt really powerless in this situation, because there was nothing I could do to stand up for myself so I kind of just took it. I got really angry, and maybe what I did was in spite, but it\u2019s done none the less. \n\nAnyways, onto what I did. My mother is big into dog shows, which means that she has several friends who are gay, and even though she would \u201cnever say anything to them\u201d she definitely believes that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and that they\u2019re going to hell for it. One particular couple I\u2019ve met several time, and were friends on Facebook. While I was in tears, I sent them a message explaining what had happened, what she said, and basically just outlining how my mother is a homophobe. I said that I just wanted to let them know what kind of person their friend was, which is definitely part of why I did it, but I think maybe I also did it because I was upset. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author came out to their mom, and the mom rejected them, being religious and saying they're going to hell. The author then messaged the mom's gay friends, telling them that their friend (the mom) is a homophobe and rejecting the author.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was hurt and upset after the rejection. They felt powerless and lashed out by contacting the mom's friends to reveal the mom's true feelings, even though the mom had previously said she wouldn't say anything negative to them. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, honesty is important, but there's also the aspect of respecting others' privacy and the potential harm caused by sharing someone's private views without their consent. The mom's friends might not want this information, even if it's true. The author's action could be seen as a breach of confidentiality, especially since they're sharing their parent's private beliefs and reactions.\n\nHowever, the author's intent was driven by hurt and a desire to inform the friends about their friend's true stance, which might conflict with the friends' own values. But even if the intent is good, the method of sharing private family matters without permission can be problematic. It could damage relationships and cause unintended consequences for the author's parents and their friends.\n\nIn many moral frameworks, respecting others' autonomy and privacy is crucial. Spreading someone's private views without their consent, even if those views are harmful, can be seen as wrong because it undermines trust and can lead to further conflict. The author might have been justified in feeling hurt, but the way they handled it by involving the mother's friends could be considered an overstep.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friends have a right to know if their friend holds views that contradict their own, especially if they're part of a marginalized group. However, the right to know is balanced against the right to privacy. The author's action might have been a form of retaliation, which could be seen as wrong because it's not addressing the problem with the mother directly but taking it out on others.\n\nConsidering both sides, the action likely falls under being in the wrong because the author didn't seek to resolve the issue with their mother and instead shared private information that could harm relationships and cause further distress. The emotional state at the time might mitigate some responsibility, but the act itself is generally considered a breach of trust and privacy.\n"
