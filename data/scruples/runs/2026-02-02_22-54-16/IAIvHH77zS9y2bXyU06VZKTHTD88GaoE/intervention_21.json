Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a long-time friend, Will, who's been dealing with depression and anorexia, but also has racist tendencies. The author is struggling because they want to distance themselves from Will's racism but feel guilty because Will is in a bad mental state and they're his only friend.\n\nFirst, the author has known Will since primary school, which means the friendship is long-standing. The racism started small, like using racial slurs behind people's backs, then escalated to aggressive behavior, like confronting black people in a park with swears and the n-word. That's pretty severe. The author tried to distance themselves when they noticed this, but Will's depression and other mental health issues complicate things.\n\nThe final incident was in a group chat where Will targeted a black person again, leading the author to block him on all social media and avoid him at school. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for cutting off a friend who's struggling with mental health issues.\n\nSo, the key points are: Will's racist behavior is harmful and ongoing, the author is protecting others from Will's actions, and there's guilt over leaving Will alone. But the author is also trying to protect themselves from being associated with Will's racism. \n\nI need to consider if cutting off a friend who's in a bad mental state is justified. The author isn't staying in contact to support Will, which could be important, but Will's behavior is harmful. The author might be protecting others from Will's racism. However, abandoning someone in dire mental health could be seen as cruel. But Will's actions are also hurting others. \n\nThe author's justification is that they can't be friends with someone who is racist, especially when it's targeted at minorities. The author's own mental health might be affected by being around Will's behavior. They tried to distance before, but things escalated. \n\nSo, the ethical dilemma is between supporting a friend in need versus not condoning or enabling harmful behavior. The author might feel conflicted, but their decision could be seen as necessary to prevent further harm. However, they could have tried to intervene more directly, like encouraging Will to get help. But given Will's aggressive behavior, maybe the author felt it was too dangerous. \n\nIn the end, the author's action is to block and avoid, not to confront or support. So the question is, is that abandonment unjust? If the author could have helped Will seek help, maybe they should have. But if Will isn't receptive, then the author's hands are tied. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're protecting others and themselves from harm, even though they're aware of Will's mental state. It's a tough call, but the decision to cut off a racist friend isn't necessarily wrong, especially after repeated harmful actions.\n"
