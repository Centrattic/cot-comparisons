Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether they did the right thing by cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they're at fault for abandoning their best friend. Will has depression, anxiety, anorexia, self-harms, and is the user's only friend. But he's also a racist, especially as he got older. The user describes instances where Will used racial slurs and targeted minorities. The final straw was when Will attacked someone in a group chat, leading the user to block him.\n\nNow, the key points here are the conflict between the user's responsibility towards their friend's mental health and Will's harmful behavior. On one hand, Will is struggling with significant mental health issues and the user is his only support. On the other, Will's racism is causing harm to others, which the user can't condone.\n\nThe user tried to distance themselves earlier but maybe didn't cut off completely until the final incident. They might feel guilty because Will is in a bad place, but they also can't support his racist actions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. The user is prioritizing their own boundaries and the well-being of others by cutting off someone who spreads hate. At the same time, they might feel they abandoned a friend in need. However, enabling harmful behavior isn't the solution. The user might have a responsibility to protect others and themselves from Will's actions, even if it means ending the friendship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted to stop harmful behavior, even though it's tough given Will's mental health struggles. It's a hard situation, but they aren't at fault for protecting others and setting boundaries.\n"
