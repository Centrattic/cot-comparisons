Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for abandoning their friend Will because of his racism, even though Will has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has known Will since primary school and was close. Will's racism started small but became more aggressive over time. There was an incident in a park where Will used racial slurs and told people to leave. The author tried to distance themselves but Will's mental health issues (depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm) made it hard. Finally, after another racist outburst in a group chat, the author cut off contact.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who expresses hate is problematic. The author might feel responsible for not helping Will change, but they can't be forced to tolerate harmful behavior. On the other hand, Will's mental health is complex, and the author was his only friend. Cutting off support could worsen his depression and self-harm. However, the author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic situation. They might have a responsibility to protect themselves and not enable harmful behavior. The final decision hinges on whether prioritizing one's own boundaries and rejecting racism overrides the duty to support a friend's mental health. In this case, the author made a tough choice but isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
