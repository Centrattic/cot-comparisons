Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite having depression and other issues. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the friend was raised in a racist environment and started with minor slurs. But as he got older, his behavior escalated. There's that example in the park where he used racial slurs and aggressive language towards black people. The author was shocked and tried to distance themselves. Then, Will has anorexia, anxiety, depression, self-harms, and the author is his only friend. But after another incident in a group chat, the author cut him off. Now they're wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to weigh the harm of racism against the friend's mental health struggles. Racism is a serious issue, and being complicit by not standing up against it can be harmful. However, the friend's mental state is also a factor. But the author tried to distance themselves before, and when it escalated, they took action. Cutting off ties might be a tough call, but considering the racist behavior is a significant red flag. The author might not be in the wrong because they can't be responsible for someone else's mental health if that person is harmful. Also, the author is protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful actions. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries instead of cutting off completely. But given the severity of the racism and the repeated incidents, it might be justified. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure I didn't miss any nuances here. The key points are the racism's severity versus the mental health aspect. The author isn't responsible for Will's actions, especially after multiple instances. So, I think B is the right choice.\n"
