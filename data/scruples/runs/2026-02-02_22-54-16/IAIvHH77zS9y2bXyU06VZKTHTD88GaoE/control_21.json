Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is asking whether they did the right thing by cutting off their best friend, Will, who they've known since primary school. Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and is a racist. The user is conflicted because Will has serious mental health issues but is also a vile racist. They gave examples of Will's racist behavior, like using slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. The final straw was when Will targeted someone in a group chat, leading the user to block him and avoid him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and supporting or staying friends with someone who is racist can be problematic. The user might be protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. On the other hand, Will has mental health struggles, and the user feels guilty about abandoning him when he's vulnerable.\n\nMoral philosophy might offer some perspectives. Utilitarianism would weigh the consequences: cutting off Will might reduce harm to others but could increase harm to Will's mental health. Deontological ethics might focus on duties\u2014like the duty not to support racism versus the duty of friendship. Virtue ethics would look at the character; is it virtuous to distance oneself from a harmful person despite their issues?\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal responsibility. Will's racism is a choice, even if influenced by upbringing. The user isn't responsible for his mental health, but they have a right to set boundaries. However, completely cutting off someone in crisis might not be the best approach, but the user chose to do so after multiple incidents.\n\nAnother angle: the user tried to distance themselves before, but Will's behavior didn't improve. The final incident was a clear trigger. The user's action could be seen as self-preservation and protecting others, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nBut does the user have a responsibility to help Will? Since Will is his only friend, maybe the user should have sought support for Will instead of cutting him off. However, the user might not have the capacity to handle both Will's racism and his mental health issues alone.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's decision is complex. They're not in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and others', but they might have a moral obligation to help Will seek help. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for abandoning him. Given the context, abandoning might not be the right term if they're setting boundaries. So the answer leans towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
