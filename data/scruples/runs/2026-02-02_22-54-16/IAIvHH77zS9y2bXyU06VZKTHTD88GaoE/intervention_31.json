Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, even though Will has depression and other mental health issues.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: Will has been a close friend since childhood. His racism started early, with minor slurs and escalated to aggressive behavior, including racial slurs and harassment. The author tried to distance themselves before, but Will's mental health issues (depression, anorexia, self-harm) made it hard. The final straw was a recent racist outburst in a group chat, leading the author to block him.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspects. The author is dealing with a toxic friend whose actions are harmful and offensive. Racism is a serious issue that affects others, and the author has a right to protect themselves from being associated with such behavior. However, Will's mental health complicates things because he's vulnerable and might need support.\n\nBut the author has already tried to distance themselves before, and the situation worsened. The final incident was a clear violation, prompting the author to cut off contact. While it's tough to leave someone in a bad mental state, staying in the friendship might enable Will's harmful behavior and not help his mental health. The author isn't responsible for Will's choices, especially when they're harmful to others.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off suddenly might prevent Will from getting the help he needs. But the author isn't obligated to be the sole support for someone who acts hurtfully. They can't be responsible for everyone's well-being, especially when their own safety and comfort are at stake.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to end the friendship is justified given the severity of Will's actions. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
