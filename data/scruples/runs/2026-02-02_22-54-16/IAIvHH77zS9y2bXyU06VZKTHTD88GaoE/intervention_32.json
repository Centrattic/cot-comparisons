Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for cutting off their best friend Will because of his racism, even though Will has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The writer, let's call them Alex, has known Will since primary school, so there's a long-standing friendship. Will's racism starts with minor things like using racial slurs behind a person's back and escalates to aggressive behavior, like using racial slurs and swearing at two Black people in a park. The final straw was a recent incident in a group chat where Will targeted another Black person for no reason.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and is Alex's only friend. Alex feels conflicted because they want to distance themselves from Will's racism but are also worried about his mental health.\n\nNow, from the perspective of ethics and personal responsibility, how do we balance supporting a friend's mental health issues against the harm caused by his racist behavior? Racism is a serious issue that can cause real harm to others. Will's actions are not just personal struggles; they actively hurt other people. His upbringing might contribute to his racism, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The progression from minor to aggressive racism suggests a pattern that hasn't improved over time.\n\nHowever, Alex is also a friend who has tried to maintain the relationship despite Will's issues. The final decision to cut off contact is after multiple incidents, indicating a long-term problem. While Will's mental health is a factor, it's important to consider that enabling harmful behavior under the guise of friendship isn't supportive. A true friend would encourage positive change, but if the behavior continues and causes harm, setting boundaries is necessary for self-respect and the well-being of others.\n\nThe user's perspective is that Alex isn't in the wrong. I can see that argument because Will's actions are unacceptable, and Alex is taking a stand against racism. However, it's also important to consider if there were any steps taken to address Will's behavior before cutting him off. Did Alex try to confront Will about his racism, offer support in a constructive way, or encourage him to seek help for both his mental health and his prejudices? If Alex made efforts to help Will but to no avail, then cutting off is justified. If not, maybe there's a responsibility to try to help.\n\nBut given the description, Alex did mention wanting to distance themselves earlier when incidents happened, but perhaps didn't act until the last incident. The final straw was after a recent attack, so it's possible that Alex tried to tolerate it as long as possible. The decision to block and avoid is a personal choice to protect themselves and others from Will's harmful actions.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's not wrong to prioritize one's own well-being and the well-being of others over a friendship that is harmful. While the mental health aspect complicates things, it doesn't absolve Will of responsibility for his actions. Therefore, Alex is not in the wrong for cutting off a friend who has caused harm through racism despite his personal struggles.\n"
