Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite having depression. The friend has a history of racist behavior, including using slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. The author felt it was a final straw when Will targeted someone in a group chat and decided to distance themselves completely. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. Will's behavior is clearly harmful and offensive. Racism is a serious issue, and it's important to stand against it. The author tried to be a friend but couldn't tolerate the racist actions anymore. On the other hand, Will has mental health issues, which complicates things because he might be struggling and need support.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice. They've tried to support Will through his depression, but his actions are harmful and unacceptable. The author isn't responsible for Will's behavior. People have the right to set boundaries, especially when someone's actions are discriminatory. Mental health shouldn't excuse harmful behavior. While the author might feel guilty about cutting off a friend, they are not in the wrong for prioritizing their values and safety. So the answer should be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
