Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for abandoning their friend Will, who has depression but is also a racist.\n\nFirst, the author's friend, Will, has been racist for a long time. From a young age, he was taught racial superiority and grew increasingly aggressive in his behavior. The examples given include using racial slurs behind others' backs and even confronting a black couple in a park with hate speech. The final straw was when Will targeted a black person in a group chat without reason.\n\nThe author is struggling with Will's mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and being isolated without friends. They feel torn between their concern for his well-being and the need to distance themselves from his harmful behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault for cutting off Will. On one hand, Will's racist actions are hurtful and harmful, and the author has a right to protect themselves and others from that toxicity. On the other hand, Will is dealing with serious mental health issues, and the author is his only friend, which adds complexity.\n\nBut racism is a choice and a harmful ideology. While mental health is important, it doesn't excuse or justify racist behavior. The author isn't responsible for fixing Will's issues or staying in a toxic friendship that endangers others. The author's decision to remove themselves is a form of self-care and protecting others, which is valid.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have tried to help Will instead of cutting him off. But given the severity and duration of Will's racism, and the fact that he was confrontational and aggressive, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their own well-being and the well-being of others.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They took a stand against racism, which is important, and they're not obligated to stay in a harmful situation. They can still care about Will's mental health without enabling his harmful behavior.\n"
