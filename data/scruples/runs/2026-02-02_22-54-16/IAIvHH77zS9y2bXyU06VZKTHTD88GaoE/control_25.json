Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will due to his racism, despite his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend, Will, has been a close companion since childhood but exhibits racist behavior, escalating over time. The author mentions specific incidents where Will used racial slurs and targeted minorities. However, Will also struggles with depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is the author's only friend. The author decided to block him after a recent outburst.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue that can cause harm to others. The author is justified in feeling uncomfortable and wanting to distance themselves from such behavior, especially since Will's actions were aggressive and targeted minorities. The fact that Will's racism seems to be rooted in his upbringing doesn't excuse the behavior, but it might explain it. However, the author is making a choice to protect themselves and others from harmful actions.\n\nOn the other hand, Will's mental health is a factor. Cutting off someone with severe mental health issues can impact their well-being. But the author isn't abandoning him entirely; they've just stopped contact. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their own mental health and the safety of others over maintaining a friendship with someone who is harmful.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, one could argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they are holding their friend accountable for his actions. Will is an adult who made choices, regardless of his upbringing. The author isn't responsible for Will's mental health issues, and it's not their duty to be his only support system, especially if he's harming others.\n\nHowever, some might say the author should try to help or seek intervention instead of cutting off. But given Will's history and the severity of recent incidents, the author might feel that continued contact is enabling harmful behavior or putting others at risk. The author's decision could be seen as self-preservation and protecting others from Will's actions.\n\nConsidering all these points, the answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They are addressing serious issues that affect others beyond just their friendship. The answer is B.\n"
