Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who's a racist but also has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On the one hand, Will is a close friend who's been through a lot: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and he's the author's only friend. That's a lot to deal with, and the author might feel responsible or conflicted about distancing themselves. \n\nBut then there's the racism. The examples given are pretty severe. Calling someone a racial slur, aggressive behavior towards minorities, and making someone leave a park because of their race. That's not just casual racism; it's active and harmful. The author was part of a group where Will targeted someone in a chat for no reason, which led to them cutting ties.\n\nNow, the author is struggling with guilt because of Will's mental health issues. They don't want to abandon someone who's vulnerable. But racism is a serious issue that affects others, not just the individual. The author is also protecting themselves from being associated with Will's harmful actions. \n\nI should also think about the fact that Will's racism is rooted in his upbringing. But even if it's ingrained, being racist is still a choice to a certain extent. The author isn't obligated to stay friends with someone who's actively harmful. \n\nFriendship is mutual, and if one person is causing harm, it's reasonable to distance oneself. However, the author might have considered trying to help or support Will while setting boundaries, but in this case, Will's behavior seems to be escalating. The final incident was a trigger, so cutting off might be a necessary step for the author's well-being and to not enable harmful behavior.\n\nSo weighing it all, while the author might feel guilty, their decision to cut ties isn't the wrong thing. They're prioritizing their own mental health and standing against racism, which is important. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
