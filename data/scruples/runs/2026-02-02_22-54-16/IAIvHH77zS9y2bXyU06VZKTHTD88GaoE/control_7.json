Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's best friend, Will, has been their close companion since primary school. But now, the author is considering abandoning him because Will is a racist. The racism started with small things like using racial slurs behind someone's back when annoyed. Then, by 16, it escalated to aggressive behavior towards minorities, including using racial slurs and swear words. One specific incident in a park where Will told two Black people to leave, using the n-word and other slurs. The author was friends with one of the guys, so they were being friendly, but Will wasn't. The author tried to confront him, but Will just said their faces made him angry. \n\nNow, the author has had enough after another incident in a group chat with a Black person, leading them to block Will on all social media and avoid him at school. However, the author is conflicted because Will is also very depressed, anorexic, anxious, and self-harming. The author is his only friend. The question is whether the author is at fault for cutting off Will.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue. It's not just about personal feelings; it affects others and can be harmful. The author tried to distance themselves while still supporting Will due to his mental health struggles. But when Will's racism is aggressive and causes harm, the author might have a right to protect themselves and others from that behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about Will's mental state. He's self-harming and has other serious issues. The author is his only friend, which adds a layer of responsibility. But is the author responsible for Will's actions and beliefs? People can choose to associate with others, but they also have the right to set boundaries, especially when someone's behavior is hurtful and discriminatory.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014blocking him and avoiding him\u2014might be seen as self-preservation. They tried to address the racism before but maybe didn't get through to Will. In that case, maintaining the friendship could enable harmful behavior. However, cutting off support entirely could worsen Will's depression and mental health. Is there a possibility the author could have found another way to help Will without abandoning him? Like encouraging him to seek professional help or setting clear boundaries about what is acceptable behavior.\n\nBut the problem is that Will's racism is part of his identity, shaped by upbringing. The author might not be able to accept that, especially if Will is unwilling to change. The author's right to end a friendship due to Will's harmful beliefs and actions isn't necessarily wrong. People have the right to choose their friends and not be complicit in racism.\n\nHowever, the author's guilt about Will's mental health is valid. Maybe they could have sought support from others or involved a professional. But the situation is complex. The author's actions are a mix of self-protection and concern for their friend's well-being. \n\nIn the end, while the author might feel guilty, they are not in the wrong for cutting off a friend who is actively harmful due to racism. The author had to prioritize their own well-being and the well-being of others, even if it means losing a friend. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
