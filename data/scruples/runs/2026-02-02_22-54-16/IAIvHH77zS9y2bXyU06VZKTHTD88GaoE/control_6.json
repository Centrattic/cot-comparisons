Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend, Will, who has racism issues but also struggles with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has known Will since primary school. Will's racism starts with minor slurs and escalates to aggressive behavior, including using racial slurs and threatening minorities. The final incident happens in a group chat with a black person, leading the author to cut off contact. The author feels conflicted because Will has mental health issues and is their only friend.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for abandoning Will. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's important to consider the severity of the bad behavior versus the circumstances. Will's racism is a serious issue. Using racial slurs, aggressive behavior towards minorities, and making someone feel unsafe are all significant. The author tried to distance themselves earlier but only cut off after the final incident. \n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health struggles. The author might feel guilty because they were his only support system. However, enabling harmful behavior isn't healthy either. The author isn't obligated to stay in a toxic friendship, especially when Will's actions are hurtful and harmful. \n\nThe key here is that the author made a choice to protect themselves and others from Will's racism. While it's true that Will is struggling, the author isn't responsible for his actions or his mental health. They can't be forced to remain friends with someone who is racist and harmful. The author's decision to cut off contact after repeated offenses is a reasonable step. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have tried to help Will instead of abandoning him. But given that Will's behavior continued despite the author's attempts to distance, and the final incident was a clear breaking point, the author's action is understandable. They are not in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and standing against racism. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
