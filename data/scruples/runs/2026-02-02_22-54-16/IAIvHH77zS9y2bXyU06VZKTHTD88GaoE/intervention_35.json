Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist and abusive, even though Will has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, the writer has known Will since primary school, so they've had a long friendship. The racism started small but escalated. At 16, Will was aggressive, using racial slurs, and even targeted someone the writer was friends with. The final straw was in a group chat where Will attacked a black person again. The writer then blocked him and avoids him now.\n\nWill has mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is their only friend. The writer feels conflicted because they care about him but can't condone his racism.\n\nI need to consider whether the writer is in the wrong. On one hand, supporting a friend with mental health problems is important. But on the other hand, Will's racist behavior is harmful and the writer has a right to protect themselves. The writer tried to distance themselves before, but Will's actions kept escalating. The final incident was a direct attack, making the writer cut off contact. \n\nThe key points are that the writer tried to address the issue over time, gave Will chances, but his actions were unacceptable. The writer isn't abandoning Will out of cruelty but to protect themselves and others from harm. Mental health doesn't excuse racism. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
