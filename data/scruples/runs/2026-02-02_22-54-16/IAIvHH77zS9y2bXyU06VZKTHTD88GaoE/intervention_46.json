Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that Will, their best friend since primary school, has depression and various mental health issues, but he's also a racist. The author has been trying to be friends with him despite his racist behavior, but after a final incident in a group chat where Will targeted a black person, the author cut him off completely.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Will's racism is a serious issue. Using racial slurs and aggressive behavior directed at minorities is harmful and unacceptable. The author has tried to distance themselves over time but now made the final decision to block Will and avoid him. \n\nOn the other hand, Will has significant mental health problems, including depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and being his only friend. The author might feel conflicted because they care about Will's well-being but can't condone his harmful actions.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's decision to cut off Will makes them at fault. The author is standing up against racism, which is a moral stance. However, they might also feel guilty for leaving a friend in need. \n\nBut is the author responsible for Will's actions? Probably not. The author isn't obligated to remain friends with someone who harms others, especially minorities. Mental health is important, but it doesn't justify harmful behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their values and safety. They might still feel conflicted, but their actions are justified in protecting others and themselves from Will's racism.\n"
