Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend, Will, who is racist but also has depression and other mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend Will has been showing racist behavior, from making racial slurs to aggressive actions towards minorities. The author tried to handle it initially but eventually decided to cut him off after a specific incident in a group chat involving a black person. However, Will's mental health issues\u2014depression, anorexia, self-harm\u2014are also a factor. The author is conflicted because they feel guilty about abandoning him.\n\nThe main ethical dilemma here is balancing the harm caused by Will's racism against the potential neglect of his mental health. The author's actions are a personal choice about their own boundaries and well-being. While the friend is in a vulnerable state, the author isn't obligated to enable harmful behavior. Supporting someone's mental health doesn't mean condoning racism. The author can't be responsible for Will's problems, especially since they've already tried to address the issues but found the behavior unacceptable.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have offered more support or sought help for Will instead of cutting off. But given the severity of the racism, which is a choice and not an illness, the author's decision to protect their own values and well-being is understandable. The final answer would depend on whether the author's right to set boundaries outweighs the potential consequences for Will's mental health. Since the author isn't a parent or caregiver, they aren't in the wrong for choosing to distance themselves.\n"
