Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe person is asking if they're at fault for cutting off their best friend, Will, because he's a racist despite having depression and other mental health issues. They've been friends since primary school, but as they grew older, Will's racism became more apparent. It started with small things like using racial slurs behind people's backs and escalated to aggressive behavior, like confronting black people with hate speech. The final straw was when Will targeted someone in a group chat, leading the author to block him and avoid him entirely. The author is conflicted because Will is also dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here: racism, mental health, and the moral obligation to maintain a friendship despite harmful behaviors. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that can cause harm and is widely condemned. The author's decision to distance themselves could be seen as standing up against racism, which is a positive action. On the other hand, Will has significant mental health struggles, and the author was his only friend, which adds complexity to the situation.\n\nThe author might feel guilt because Will is vulnerable, but it's also important to recognize that supporting someone with mental health issues doesn't mean tolerating or enabling harmful behavior. There's a difference between being a supportive friend and allowing someone to continue harmful actions. The author might have tried to address the issue before cutting off, like when they were shocked and asked Will about his behavior, but Will's response was offensive. If previous attempts to correct or discuss the behavior failed, the author has the right to set boundaries for their own well-being and ethics.\n\nHowever, completely cutting off someone without any attempt at intervention or support might be seen as abandoning them, especially if they're in a vulnerable state. But given that Will's behavior is aggressive and racist, and the author might not feel equipped to handle the situation, it's a difficult decision. The author's mental health and their right to be in a safe, respectful environment should also be considered.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is morally responsible for Will's actions. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to distance themselves from someone who is being harmful and racist. Everyone has the right to end a friendship, especially when it's affecting their well-being. The author's guilt about Will's mental state is understandable, but that doesn't mean they're at fault for prioritizing their values and their own mental health. So the answer is B.\n"
