Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if they're at fault for cutting off their oldest and closest friend, Will, because he's a racist and has depression. \n\nFirst, the friend Will was raised in a racist environment, and as they grew up, his racist behavior became more aggressive. The user mentions specific incidents, like using racial slurs and openly targeting minorities with aggression. The worst example was when Will used a racial slur and told two black people to leave, even saying their faces made him angry. That's pretty severe.\n\nThe user also points out that Will has several mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. They were his only friend, which adds a layer of responsibility or at least a sense of duty to help him. But the user felt that the recent incident in the group chat was the final straw and decided to cut him off completely, blocking him on social media and avoiding him at school. Now they're questioning if they did the right thing, especially given Will's mental state.\n\nSo the key elements here are the severity of Will's racism, the user's role as his only support, and the ethical dilemma of distancing oneself from a troubled friend. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that can cause harm and is morally wrong. The user might feel that they can't support someone who expresses such hate, especially after repeated incidents. On the other hand, Will is struggling with mental health, and cutting off contact could leave him without any support, potentially worsening his condition. \n\nBut I should consider that while mental health is important, it doesn't excuse harmful behaviors like racism. People can be held accountable for their actions even if they have mental health struggles. The user had been trying to manage this for years, from when they were teenagers (around 15-16 years old) up to now. If Will's behavior is persistent and harmful, the user isn't necessarily wrong to set boundaries. However, the user might feel guilty for abandoning a friend in need, which is understandable. \n\nThe question is whether the user's actions are justified. The answer would depend on the balance between supporting a friend and not enabling or condoning harmful behavior. The user might have tried to address the racism before, but if it's not changing and is causing distress, leaving is a valid choice. But the user could also be criticized for not seeking professional help for Will or trying to support him while still holding him accountable. \n\nHowever, in the scenario described, the user seems to have tried to be a friend but found the racism too much to endure. The final incident in the group chat might have been the tipping point where they realized they couldn't continue supporting someone with such harmful views. While it's a tough decision, the user isn't at fault for prioritizing their own well-being and the well-being of others over maintaining a toxic friendship. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of Will being their only friend. If the user had other ways to support him without perpetuating his racist behavior, that might be different. However, given the information, it's possible the user felt they had no choice left. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), as they're choosing to protect themselves and others from a friend's harmful actions, even if that friend is struggling with mental health.\n"
