Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who is racist but also has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Will was a close friend since childhood, but his racist behavior escalated over time. The author tried to distance themselves but finally blocked him after a public racist outburst. However, Will has mental health struggles, including depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is their only friend. The author is conflicted because they feel guilty about abandoning someone in need, but can't tolerate the racism.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Legally, there's nothing wrong with cutting off a friend. Ethically, it's more complex. The author is protecting themselves from harmful behavior, which is understandable. However, abandoning someone in a vulnerable state without support might be seen as harsh. But at the same time, enabling toxic behavior isn't right either. The author tried to distance themselves earlier, but the final incident pushed them to sever contact. They might be criticized for not trying to help Will address his racism first, but if Will isn't willing to change, the author isn't responsible for his actions. Mental health issues don't excuse racism. The author is within their rights to prioritize their own well-being and safety. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
