Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend, Will, who is racist but also has depression and other issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend has been exhibiting racist behavior, escalating over time. From small slurs to aggressive outbursts, including racial slurs and hate speech. The author, despite being Will's closest friend and having a long history with him, finally decides to cut him off after a recent incident in a group chat. \n\nWill's mental health issues are significant: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm. But his behavior is still harmful and racist. The author is conflicted because they feel guilty about cutting off someone who is struggling, but they can't condone the racism.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is whether it's right to distance oneself from someone who is harmful due to racism, even if they have personal issues. The author isn't shunning Will just because of his depression but because his actions are hurtful. They tried to be friends despite his issues but reached a breaking point. \n\nIt's important to note that while mental health is a critical factor, it doesn't excuse harmful behavior. The author chose to protect themselves and possibly others from Will's racist actions. They might be wrong if they ignored his mental health completely, but they did acknowledge his struggles while setting a boundary. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They prioritized ethical behavior and safety over a friendship that was becoming toxic and harmful.\n"
