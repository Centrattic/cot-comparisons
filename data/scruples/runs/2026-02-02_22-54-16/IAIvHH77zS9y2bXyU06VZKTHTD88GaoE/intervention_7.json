Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by cutting off their friend who has depression and is a racist. The friend, Will, was raised in a racist environment and has shown racist behavior over the years. The author was his best friend since primary school but finally decided to distance themselves after a final incident in a group chat. The question is if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for this action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been exhibiting racist behavior, which is harmful and unacceptable. The author tried to be a friend and even defended him in the past. However, the racism escalated, including aggressive actions and using racial slurs. The final incident in the group chat was the last straw. The author then blocked him and avoids him, which is a response to protect themselves and others from Will's toxic behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm. The author is his only friend, which adds emotional weight to the situation. The author might feel conflicted because they care about Will's well-being but can't tolerate his racism.\n\nThe key here is balancing the harm caused by Will's racism against the author's responsibility as a friend. While mental health is important, it doesn't excuse harmful behavior. The author's decision to distance themselves is a form of self-protection and standing up against racism. However, cutting off suddenly without addressing the issue might not be the best approach. But given that Will's behavior is intentional and harmful, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting themselves. They can't be responsible for someone else's mental health if that person refuses to change their harmful actions.\n"
