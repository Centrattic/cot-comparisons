Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend who has depression and is a racist. The author, let's call them Alex, has been friends with Will since primary school. Will's racism started small, like using racial slurs behind people's backs, and escalated to aggressive behavior towards minorities. At 16, Will even used a racial slur and swore at Black people in a park. Despite this, Will also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is Alex's only friend. The final incident was in a group chat where Will targeted a Black person, leading Alex to block him and avoid him. The question is whether Alex did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Being friends with someone who holds harmful beliefs, especially racism, can be complex. Racism is a serious issue that affects others and perpetuates discrimination. Supporting someone with mental health issues is important, but there's a balance. If Will's racism is causing harm to others, Alex might feel justified in distancing themselves. However, cutting off someone who is struggling with mental health could be seen as abandoning them when they need support the most.\n\nOn one hand, Alex is protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. It's reasonable to set boundaries when someone's actions are offensive and hurtful. Racism is not something to be tolerated, and it's important to stand against it. Alex might feel they can't continue the friendship if Will doesn't change.\n\nOn the other hand, Will is dealing with significant mental health issues, and Alex is his only friend. The question is whether Alex should have tried to help him change rather than cut him off. Supporting someone with depression and other issues can be challenging, but completely severing the relationship might leave Will without any support system. However, enabling harmful behavior (like racism) isn't healthy for either person.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal responsibility. Will was taught racism from a young age but is an adult now. He has a choice in his behavior. If he's unwilling to address his racism and instead continues to harm others, Alex has the right to protect themselves. Mental health struggles don't excuse racist behavior. However, the situation is complicated because Will is also in a vulnerable state.\n\nThe final incident in the group chat was the last straw. It seems like Will hasn't changed his behavior despite past warnings. Alex might feel that they've given him chances, and now it's time to prioritize their own well-being and the well-being of others. But the lingering guilt about Will's mental health shows Alex's internal conflict.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the person in the wrong here is Will for his racist actions and failure to address them. Alex is trying to do the right thing by setting boundaries, even if it's difficult. While cutting off a friend is tough, especially when they're struggling, it's a personal decision that Alex has the right to make. They can't be responsible for Will's mental health if Will isn't seeking help or changing his harmful behavior.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that Alex is not in the wrong. The correct choice is B.\n"
