Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who has depression but is also a racist. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been friends with Will since primary school. Will has a history of racist behavior, escalating from minor slurs to aggressive actions. However, he also struggles with depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and the author is his only friend. The final straw was when Will targeted someone in a group chat, leading the author to block him and avoid him.\n\nThe main ethical dilemma here is balancing the harm caused by Will's racism against the author's responsibility towards his mental health. The author feels conflicted because they don't want to abandon someone who's clearly suffering but can't tolerate the racist behavior anymore.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue. The author is protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful actions. Will's behavior is not just offensive but also aggressive and targeted, which can cause significant harm to others. Standing up against racism is important, and the author has every right to distance themselves from such behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health issues that are severe. The author is his only friend, and cutting off contact might leave him without support. The author is struggling with guilt over this decision. However, being friends with someone doesn't mean you have to enable harmful behavior. The author isn't abandoning him out of malice but because Will's actions are unacceptable and harmful.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while the author is responsible for their own actions, they aren't responsible for fixing Will's mental health or his racism. The author has a right to set boundaries to protect themselves and others. The final decision to cut off contact seems like a personal choice based on the cumulative effect of Will's behavior, especially after repeated incidents.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong. They are prioritizing their values and safety, which is a valid response. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
