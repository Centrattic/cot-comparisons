Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will having mental health issues like depression, anorexia, and self-harm.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author has been friends with Will since primary school. Will's racism escalates over time, from subtle slurs to aggressive behavior. The author tried to distance themselves but kept in touch because Will was struggling with mental health issues. The final incident in the group chat was the last straw, leading the author to block Will. They're now questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Will's behavior is clearly harmful and racist, which is a serious issue. The author is protecting themselves and others from Will's toxic behavior. On the other hand, Will is dealing with mental health challenges, which complicates things. The author might feel guilty because they were Will's only friend.\n\nBut is it the author's fault for setting boundaries? People have the right to distance themselves from individuals who cause harm, even if that person is in a vulnerable state. The author tried to be a supportive friend before, but Will's actions crossed lines. The final incident pushed them to take action. It's important to acknowledge that mental health doesn't excuse harmful actions. The author isn't being cruel; they're prioritizing their well-being and safety. They might still feel responsible, but ethically, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for cutting ties when the behavior is unacceptable. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
