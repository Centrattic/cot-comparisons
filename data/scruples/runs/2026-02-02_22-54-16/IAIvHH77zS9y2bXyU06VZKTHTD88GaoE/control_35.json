Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's friend, Will, has been exhibiting racist behavior since they were teenagers. The author mentions instances where Will uses racial slurs, targets minorities, and even confronts black people in a park. The author tried to distance themselves but couldn't because Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and the author is his only friend. Recently, Will made a racist comment in a group chat, leading the author to block him and avoid contact. Now, the author is conflicted about whether they're at fault.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. The author is standing up against harmful behavior, which is important. Everyone has the right to be treated with respect, and allowing racist comments can enable that behavior. The author might feel that they can't be around someone who spreads hate, even if the person has their own struggles.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health issues. The author is his only support system, and cutting contact might leave him without any help. The author might feel guilty for not providing support during his tough times. However, enabling someone's harmful behavior isn't helping them; it could actually make things worse. Mental health doesn't excuse racism, but it's a factor to consider when deciding how to support someone.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of the racist actions versus the mental health struggles. The author's decision to end the friendship is about protecting others from harm and setting boundaries. While it's painful to cut someone off, especially a close friend, it's a responsible choice when the person's actions are harmful. The author might still feel a sense of responsibility, but they aren't obligated to stay in a toxic or harmful friendship. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong because they're taking a stand against racism, which is a significant issue. Supporting someone with mental health problems is important, but that doesn't mean enabling their harmful behavior. The author's actions are about maintaining their own boundaries and preventing harm to others, which is not the wrong choice.\n"
