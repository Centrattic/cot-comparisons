Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend Will because he's a racist. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has known Will since primary school. They mention that Will was raised in a racist household and that his racism started small but got worse over time. There are specific incidents described, like using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves but felt conflicted because Will has depression, anxiety, anorexia, self-harm issues, and is their only friend. The final incident in the group chat was the breaking point, leading the author to block Will and avoid him.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and the author is making a stand against harmful behavior. They've tried to deal with the problem before but it escalated. On the other hand, Will has significant mental health issues, and the author might feel guilty for cutting off their only support system for him.\n\nBut it's important to note that enabling harmful behavior isn't the solution. The author isn't responsible for Will's mental health; they can't be expected to stay in a toxic relationship just because someone is struggling. Will's racism is a choice that affects others, and the author is protecting themselves and others from it. The author made a difficult decision, but it's their right to set boundaries. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
