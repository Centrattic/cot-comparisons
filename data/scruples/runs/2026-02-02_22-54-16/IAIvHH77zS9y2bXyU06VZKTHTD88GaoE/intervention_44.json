Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who cut off their friend Will is in the wrong. The situation involves Will being racist and having mental health issues.\n\nFirst, the friend Will has a history of racism, starting with minor slurs and escalating to aggressive behavior. At 16, he used racial slurs and aggressive language towards black people in a park. The author tried to distance themselves but eventually cut off Will after another incident in a group chat. Will also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of Will's behavior. Racism is a serious issue, and the author is standing up against it. They tried to manage their friendship but reached a breaking point. Mental health is important, but that doesn't excuse harmful behavior. The author didn't cut off Will out of spite but because his actions were unacceptable. They also feel conflicted about it, showing they care about his well-being, but they can't support his harmful actions.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a tough choice to protect themselves and others from Will's racism while acknowledging his mental health struggles. The answer should be B.\n"
