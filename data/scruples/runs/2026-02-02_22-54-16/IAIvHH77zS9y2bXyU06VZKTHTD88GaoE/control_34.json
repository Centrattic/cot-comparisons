Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist, even though Will has mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has known Will since primary school, so they have a long history. Will was raised in a racist environment and exhibits racist behavior. Examples include using racial slurs, aggressive behavior towards minorities, and making offensive remarks. The author tried to distance themselves before but now took a firm stand after another incident in a group chat. However, Will also has depression, anxiety, anorexia, and self-harms, making the situation complicated.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they feel bad about leaving Will, who is in a vulnerable state. The question is whether cutting ties is justified or if they should have tried to help more.\n\nI should think about the responsibility we have towards others. Racism is a serious issue that affects others' lives and well-being. If someone is intentionally harming others or spreading hate, it's reasonable to distance oneself. However, the author is also concerned about Will's mental health. But supporting someone's harmful behavior isn't the same as supporting them through their struggles. There's a difference between enabling harmful actions and seeking help for mental health.\n\nThe author might have a duty to confront Will's racism rather than enabling it, even if they care about his well-being. However, completely cutting off might leave Will without support. Maybe the author should have tried to address the racism while still offering support for his mental health issues. But given the severity and persistence of Will's behavior, it's understandable that the author felt forced to take a stance.\n\nThe final decision hinges on whether the author's actions were justified in protecting others from harm and their own boundaries, versus the obligation to support a friend in need. It's a tough balance, but racism is a significant issue, and the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing others' safety and their own comfort in a toxic relationship.\n"
