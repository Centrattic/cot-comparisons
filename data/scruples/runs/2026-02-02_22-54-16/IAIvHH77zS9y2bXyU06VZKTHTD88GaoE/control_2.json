Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has known Will since primary school, so they're close friends. Will has a history of racism that started with small things and escalated to aggressive behavior, including racial slurs and targeting minorities. The author tried to distance themselves before but now, after a recent incident in a group chat, they completely cut off contact. However, Will also has significant mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and he's their only friend. The author is conflicted because they feel guilty about abandoning him even though his actions were hurtful.\n\nSo the question is whether the author did the wrong thing by cutting off Will. On one hand, Will's racism is harmful and offensive. The author had to put up with it for years, and the final incident was a breaking point. It's important to stand against racism and protect oneself from toxic behavior. On the other hand, Will has serious mental health struggles, and the author is his only support system. Ending the friendship might leave him more isolated, which could worsen his mental health.\n\nBut racism is a choice, even if it's rooted in upbringing. While Will's background contributes to his views, it's not an excuse. The author isn't responsible for fixing his racism or his mental health issues. They have the right to set boundaries and protect their own well-being. However, completely cutting off someone without any support could be seen as harsh, especially if the author was his only friend. Maybe there's a middle ground, like seeking help for Will or involving others, but the author might not be in a position to do that.\n\nThe key points are the severity of Will's actions (aggressive racism, using slurs) and the author's right to distance themselves from harmful behavior. Mental health is important, but it doesn't justify harmful actions. The author isn't obligated to stay in a friendship that's toxic and damaging. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author has the right to protect themselves from racism, even if the friend has mental health issues.\n"
