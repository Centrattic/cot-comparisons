Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist. \n\nFirst, the friend, Will, has a history of racism starting from a young age. He's used racial slurs, targeted minorities both verbally and physically, and made aggressive comments. The writer tried to distance themselves earlier but stayed because Will was dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and the writer felt like his only friend.\n\nNow, the final incident was Will attacking someone in a group chat, leading the writer to block him and avoid him. The writer is conflicted because Will's mental health issues are still a concern.\n\nI need to consider if the writer did the right thing. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that affects others and can cause harm. Supporting someone who holds and acts on racist views can enable harmful behavior. The writer's decision to cut ties might be necessary for their own well-being and to not support such behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer is worried about Will's mental health. However, Will's actions are not just personal; they impact others. The writer has tried to warn him before but the behavior continued. Cutting off a toxic friend might be the right choice, even if it's hard.\n\nAlso, the writer isn't ignoring the mental health aspect but is choosing to prioritize their own boundaries and the well-being of others. It's possible to support someone's mental health without endorsing their harmful actions. Maybe the writer isn't in the wrong here because they're holding Will accountable for his racism, which is important.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior, even though they cared about him. It's a tough situation, but prioritizing personal and others' safety over a toxic friendship isn't wrong.\n"
