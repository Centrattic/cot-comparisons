Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a best friend named Will, who they've known since childhood. But Will is a racist, and his racism has gotten worse over time. The author is struggling because they feel conflicted between cutting him off and his depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Will's racism includes using racial slurs, aggressive behavior towards minorities, and making hurtful comments. The author has tried to distance themselves for a while but finally cut off contact after a recent incident. However, Will also has mental health issues\u2014depression, anxiety, anorexia, self-harm, and he's the author's only friend. The author is feeling guilty about abandoning him.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, supporting a friend's mental health is important, but Will's behavior is harmful and offensive. The author had valid reasons to distance themselves, especially after the racist remarks and actions. However, they did completely cut him off without any communication, which might leave Will feeling isolated, especially since he's struggling with mental health. \n\nBut, Will's actions are not excusable. Racism is a serious issue, and the author has the right to protect themselves from that. The author tried to be a friend, but it's clear that Will's behavior was toxic. The fact that Will was raised in a racist environment doesn't excuse his actions. The author's decision to end the friendship is about self-respect and not enabling harmful behavior. \n\nHowever, the author might have considered reaching out to Will in a compassionate way, perhaps helping him seek professional help or involving other resources. But given Will's aggressive and persistent racism, it's understandable that the author felt that cutting off was necessary for their own mental well-being. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their values and safety over maintaining a toxic friendship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author made a difficult decision to protect themselves from racism and toxic behavior, even though they feel guilty about Will's mental health. They are not at fault here.\n"
