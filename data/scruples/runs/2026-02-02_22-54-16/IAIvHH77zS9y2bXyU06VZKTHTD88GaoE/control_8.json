Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend Will due to his racism, despite Will's mental health issues. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author's friend Will has a history of racism, starting from small slurs and escalating to aggressive behavior. The author tried to distance themselves but couldn't fully cut off because Will was struggling with depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and had no other friends. However, a recent incident in a group chat with a black person was the final straw, leading the author to block him and avoid him.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author at fault? Well, Will's behavior is clearly problematic. Racism is a serious issue, and it's not acceptable. The author was likely trying to protect themselves and others from Will's harmful actions. However, Will's mental health is also a factor. The author might feel conflicted about cutting off a friend who is in a bad place, especially someone who has been close since childhood.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of Will's racism and the author's right to set boundaries. While it's important to support friends, one isn't obligated to stay in a harmful or toxic situation. The author might have tried to help or tolerate Will's behavior up to a point, but after repeated incidents and the final incident in the group chat, it's reasonable to prioritize their own well-being and the safety of others. \n\nAt the same time, the author might feel guilty for abandoning Will during a tough time. But it's also possible that Will's racist views are a part of his identity that he hasn't addressed or changed despite his mental health struggles. The author isn't responsible for fixing Will's issues, especially if Will hasn't shown willingness to change or seek help for his racism.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, you have to weigh the responsibility to support a friend against the harm caused by Will's actions. Racism is a choice, even if it's rooted in upbringing. The author has the right to distance themselves from someone who spreads hatred, regardless of that person's mental state. It's not the author's fault for prioritizing their values and the well-being of others over a friendship that's becoming toxic.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are justified in ending the friendship to protect themselves and others from Will's racist behavior, even though they care about his mental health issues.\n"
