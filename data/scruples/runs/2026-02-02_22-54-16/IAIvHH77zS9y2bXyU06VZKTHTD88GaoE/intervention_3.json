Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite being depressed. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the friend Will has a history of racism from a young age, escalating over time. The author tried to be a friend, but the racism became too much. The key points are that Will's racism is harmful and that he has mental health issues. The author had to deal with this for years but finally decided to cut him off after a recent incident.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. It's hurtful and harmful, and the author was exposed to that. The author has a right to protect themselves from toxic behavior. Cutting off someone who is a constant source of negativity and harmful speech can be necessary for their own well-being. The fact that Will is depressed and the author feels guilty is understandable, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their own mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of being a friend. The author was Will's only friend, which adds a layer of responsibility. However, being a friend doesn't mean putting up with harmful behavior. The author tried to be there for Will, but eventually, the line was crossed. The author's decision to stop the relationship could be seen as a self-preservation act rather than abandonment.\n\nAlso, the author's guilt is a sign that they care, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. It's about setting boundaries. In such cases, boundaries are important to maintain one's own mental health. So, considering all this, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They made a tough decision to protect themselves from someone's harmful behavior, even though they feel guilty. The correct answer is B.\n"
