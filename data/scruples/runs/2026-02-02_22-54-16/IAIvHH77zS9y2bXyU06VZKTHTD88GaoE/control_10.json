Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's mental health issues. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and Will have been friends since primary school, so there's a long history. Will was raised in a racist environment and has shown racist behavior over the years, escalating from minor slurs to aggressive actions. The author tried to distance themselves before but stayed because Will is depressed, anorexic, anxious, and self-harming, with the author being his only friend.\n\nThe final straw was Will's racist outburst in a group chat, leading the author to block him and avoid him. Now they're questioning if they did the right thing, given Will's mental health struggles.\n\nSo, the key points here are the severity of Will's racism and the author's reasons for staying. The author had to deal with their friend's harmful behavior, which is not acceptable. While Will's mental health is a factor, it doesn't excuse the racist actions. The author might feel conflicted because they were the only support, but they also have the right to set boundaries, especially when the friend's behavior is harmful. \n\nRacism is a serious issue, and enabling someone's harmful behavior by staying just because they're struggling mentally can be counterproductive. The author tried to help before but reached a breaking point. It's important to support someone's mental health, but not at the cost of tolerating hate speech and aggression. The author's decision to distance themselves could be seen as self-respect and standing against racism, even if it's hard. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have tried harder to help Will, but given the escalation and the harm caused, it's reasonable to prioritize their own well-being and values. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They made a tough choice between friendship and principles, which is understandable."
