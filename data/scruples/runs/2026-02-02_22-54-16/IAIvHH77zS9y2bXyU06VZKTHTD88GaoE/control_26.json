Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a best friend named Will who's been a close friend since primary school. But Will is a racist, and the author is now cutting him off because of his racist behavior. However, Will also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and the author is his only friend. The question is, is the author in the wrong for abandoning Will?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is distancing themselves from someone who's a close friend but has harmful behavior. Racism is a serious issue, and enabling or ignoring it can be problematic. The author tried to be friends despite Will's racism but eventually had enough when Will targeted a black person in a group chat. On the other hand, Will has significant mental health issues and the author is his only support system. \n\nBut there's a balance here. The author has a right to their own comfort and safety, and being around someone who is actively racist can be harmful and stressful, especially if that person is hostile towards minorities. The author might be doing the right thing by setting a boundary, but they're also concerned about Will's mental health. \n\nHowever, cutting off someone suddenly might not be the best approach. Perhaps the author should have tried to address the issue with Will first, maybe encourage him to seek help for his racism and mental health issues. But considering how aggressive Will has been in his racism, maybe the author felt that staying in the friendship was no longer safe or healthy for them. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that Will's racism started from his upbringing, but the author is not responsible for that. They can't be held accountable for Will's background, but they have a right to decide who they associate with. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and not supporting harmful behavior. \n\nAt the same time, the author might have a responsibility to try to help Will, given that he's their only friend. But that's a tough spot. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because they're not obligated to maintain a friendship that is toxic and harmful. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). They're setting a boundary against racism, which is important, even if Will has mental health issues. The author can't be responsible for Will's actions and mental health, but their decision to distance is a personal choice for their own well-being.\n"
