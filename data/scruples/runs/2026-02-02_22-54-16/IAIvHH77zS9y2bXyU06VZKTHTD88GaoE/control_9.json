Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did something wrong by cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist, even though he has depression and other issues. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The friend, Will, has been racist since they were kids. The user mentions that Will was taught racism in his household. As they grew up, his racism escalated from minor slurs to aggressive behavior towards minorities. There's an example where Will used a racial slur and told two black people to leave the park, which shocked the user. The user tried to distance themselves but felt conflicted because Will is also dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. The final incident was in a group chat where Will attacked a black person again, leading the user to block him and avoid him entirely.\n\nNow, the user is wondering if they are at fault (AITA) for cutting off their best friend. The key points here are the severity of Will's actions and the user's justification for leaving. \n\nOn one hand, Will's racism is harmful and hurtful, especially when he's actively targeting others with slurs and aggression. Racism is a serious issue, and standing by someone who spreads hate can enable harmful behavior. The user has tried to distance themselves before, so the final straw was a repeat offense. \n\nOn the other hand, the user acknowledges that Will has mental health struggles, which complicates things. However, having mental health issues doesn't excuse racist behavior. People can struggle with various issues but are still responsible for their actions. The user might feel guilty for abandoning someone in need, but prioritizing safety and standing against racism is important. \n\nIt's also important to consider the impact of Will's actions on others. His behavior affects not just the victim but also the people around him. The user might have a right to protect themselves from the stress of such a friendship and to not support harmful actions. \n\nHowever, completely cutting off a friend who is in a vulnerable state without trying to address the issue or seek help might be seen as harsh. But the user has already tried to distance themselves before, and this was a recurring problem. The final incident was a direct attack in a group chat, which could be a legitimate trigger. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user isn't at fault for leaving. They are choosing not to associate with someone who spreads hate, even if that person has their own struggles. It's a difficult situation, but the user's actions are justified in standing up against racism and protecting themselves. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
