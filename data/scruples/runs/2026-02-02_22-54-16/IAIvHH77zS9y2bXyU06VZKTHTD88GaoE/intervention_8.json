Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, even though Will has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been friends with Will since primary school. Will's racism started small, like using racial slurs behind others' backs, and escalated to aggressive behavior, including targeting minorities. There's a specific incident where Will used the n-word and told two Black people to leave. The author tried to distance themselves before, but Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harms, and the author is his only friend.\n\nNow, the author blocked Will on all social media and avoids him at school. They're conflicted because Will's mental health issues make them feel guilty, but his racism is a deal-breaker.\n\nI need to consider the moral aspects here. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and Will's behavior is harmful and offensive. The author is standing up against racism, which is a positive action. On the other hand, Will has significant mental health challenges, and ending the friendship might leave him without support. However, the author isn't responsible for fixing Will's problems. Will's actions are his own, regardless of his mental state. Also, the author tried to distance themselves earlier, but Will's behavior continued. The final straw was the group chat incident.\n\nIs there a middle ground? The author could have tried to address the racism more directly, maybe seek help or encourage counseling. But given that Will's behavior is aggressive and harmful, and the author is the only friend, continuing the friendship might enable harmful behavior. Also, the author's well-being is important; they can't be expected to tolerate hate speech and aggression.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether supporting a racist friend despite their mental health issues is necessary. But racism is a choice, and while mental health can influence behavior, it doesn't excuse it. The author isn't responsible for Will's upbringing or his mental health. They made a choice to protect themselves and others from Will's harmful actions. So, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
