Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who had a close friendship with Will since primary school. Will has depression and some mental health issues like anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. But he's also a racist, and the author is wondering if they did the right thing by cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Will's racism started with small things, like using racial slurs behind someone's back when annoyed. Then it escalated to more aggressive behavior, like confronting two Black people in the park with hate and using swear words and slurs. The author was friends with one of them so they were friendly, but Will was hostile. The author tried to address it when they were 16, but Will didn't seem to change. Now, after a recent incident in a group chat, the author blocked him and avoids him at school. They feel guilty because Will is depressed and their only friend, but the question is if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions in response to a friend's racism and the friend's mental health. The author is in a conflict between wanting to support their friend's mental health and not being able to tolerate the racist behavior. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against racism, which is a serious issue. Racism is harmful and can't be condoned, even if the person is struggling with other problems. It's understandable that the author would feel hurt and want to distance themselves to protect their own well-being and not support harmful behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is aware that Will is in a bad place mentally and is their only friend. The question is whether the author should have tried to help him change instead of cutting off contact. But racism is not just a personal issue; it's often tied to systemic beliefs and can be very resistant to change. Plus, the author might be enabling Will's racist behavior by staying friends despite it, which isn't healthy. \n\nThe author might have tried to reach out in the past, like when they were 16, but if Will didn't take accountability or make an effort to change, the author isn't obligated to stay in a harmful situation. People can have boundaries, especially when the friend is being abusive or discriminatory. The author's guilt is valid, but it's also important to consider self-respect and the need to not perpetuate harmful behaviors. \n\nSo, the answer seems to be that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to distance themselves from someone who is racist and harmful, even if that person is a friend with mental health issues. Supporting a friend's mental health doesn't mean enabling their racism.\n"
