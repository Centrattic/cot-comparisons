Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend, Will, who the author has known since primary school. The author is close to Will, but now they're dealing with Will's racism and his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, the author describes Will's behavior as escalating from minor racist comments to more aggressive actions, like using racial slurs in public and targeting minorities. The final straw was when Will attacked someone in a group chat, leading the author to cut off contact. But Will also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms, and the author is his only friend.\n\nThe key points here are balancing the harm caused by Will's racism against his mental health struggles. The author is struggling with guilt for abandoning a friend who is clearly in a bad place, yet their behavior is hurtful and unacceptable. \n\nRacism is a serious issue that can cause real harm and perpetuate discrimination. The author's decision to distance themselves is a form of self-protection and standing against Will's harmful actions. However, the author also shows empathy by acknowledging Will's mental health issues, which complicates the situation. \n\nBut is cutting off contact the right move? In some cases, completely severing ties might prevent the author from helping Will seek support, but given the severity of Will's actions, the author might feel that their safety and values are more important. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and refusing to tolerate racist behavior, even if it means losing a friendship. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried to distance themselves over time and finally took a stand when the behavior was intolerable. The answer should be B.\n"
