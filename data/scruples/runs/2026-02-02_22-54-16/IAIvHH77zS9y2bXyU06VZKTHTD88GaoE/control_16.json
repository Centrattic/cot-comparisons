Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a long-time friend, Will, who has depression and other issues but is also a racist. The author had to deal with Will's racism over the years, which escalated from small slurs to more aggressive behavior. The final straw was when Will attacked someone in a group chat, leading the author to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, Will's racist behavior is harmful and unacceptable. The author has a right to distance themselves from someone who spreads hate, especially if it's affecting their own well-being. The author might feel that they can't support someone who holds such views, even if that person is struggling with mental health issues.\n\nOn the other hand, Will is dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. The author is his only friend, so cutting off contact might leave him without any support system. The author might feel guilty about abandoning him during such a vulnerable time. The question is whether the author's decision was justified given the circumstances.\n\nI should think about the impact of the author's actions. Ending the friendship protects the author from being around toxic behavior and sets a boundary against racism. However, it also removes a crucial support system for Will, which could worsen his mental health. But maybe there's a middle ground, like encouraging him to seek help without enabling his racist behavior. However, the author might not feel responsible for being his only support, especially if they've tried to address the behavior before and it didn't change.\n\nAlso, the author's mental health and safety are important. Dealing with a racist friend who targets minorities can be stressful and harmful. The author might be protecting themselves by ending the friendship, which is a valid choice.\n\nIn the end, while cutting off a friend isn't easy, the author's actions seem to be about standing up against racism and self-preservation. The answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their values and well-being, even though it's a tough decision.\n"
