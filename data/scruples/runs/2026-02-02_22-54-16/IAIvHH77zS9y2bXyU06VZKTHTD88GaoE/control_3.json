Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist. The friend has depression, anxiety, anorexia, self-harms, and is their only friend. The question is whether the author is at fault (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to weigh the situation. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014using racial slurs, aggressive behavior towards minorities. Racism is a serious issue, and it's important to consider that the author is distancing themselves because of Will's harmful actions. On the other hand, Will has mental health issues and the author is his only support system.\n\nBut the key point here is the author's right to set boundaries. Even if Will is struggling, being a racist and acting on that hate is not acceptable. The author isn't responsible for Will's mental health; they can't be expected to stay in a toxic situation. The author's decision to cut off contact is about protecting their own well-being and not condoning racism. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have tried to help Will instead of cutting him off. But given the severity of Will's behavior and the fact that he was aggressive and targeted others, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their safety and values. It's not about abandoning someone in need, but recognizing that Will's actions are harmful and possibly contributing to his own issues, not just being a victim of his upbringing.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for cutting off a racist friend, even with his mental health struggles.\n"
