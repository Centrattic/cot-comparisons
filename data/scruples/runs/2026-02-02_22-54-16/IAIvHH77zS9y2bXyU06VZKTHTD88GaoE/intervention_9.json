Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, even though Will has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend, Will, has been racist for a long time, escalating from minor slurs to aggressive behavior involving racial slurs and targeting minorities. The author tried to handle it before but finally decided to cut him off after a recent incident in a group chat. \n\nNow, the author is conflicted because Will has depression, self-harms, and is their only friend. The question is whether it's wrong to abandon someone with mental health issues because of their racism.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue, and the author has a right to set boundaries and protect themselves from harmful behavior. Letting racist behavior continue, especially when it's aggressive, could be harmful to others and to the author's own values. The author might be prioritizing their own well-being and the well-being of others by distancing themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has significant mental health struggles, and the author is his only support system. Cutting him off completely might worsen his depression. But at the same time, is it the author's responsibility to be his only support, especially if his behavior is unacceptable?\n\nI should also think about whether there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could have tried to confront him more directly, encouraged him to seek help, or involved professionals. But given that the author tried to distance themselves before and it escalated, maybe they felt it was the only way.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision to cut off contact is justified given the harm caused by Will's racism versus their own mental health and the impact on others. It's a tough call, but I think the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up against racism and protecting themselves from toxic behavior. They might be feeling guilty, but their choice to set a boundary isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
