Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend Will because he's a racist, even though he has depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, the author describes Will's behavior: he's a racist, uses racial slurs, targets minorities, and even threatens people. Those are serious issues. Racism is harmful and should be addressed. The author tried to distance themselves before, but after a final incident in a group chat, they completely cut him off.\n\nNow, considering Will's mental health: he's depressed, anorexic, anxious, self-harms, and is the author's only friend. The author is conflicted because they don't want to abandon someone in need. But Will's actions are hurtful and harmful, which affects others.\n\nThe key here is whether supporting someone's harmful behavior is justified just because they have mental health issues. Mental health is important, but so is standing against racism. The author isn't being cruel for no reason; they're protecting others and themselves from Will's toxic behavior. While it's sad that Will is struggling, enabling his racism by staying friends could make things worse. The author made a difficult choice to prioritize their values and safety, which makes sense. So, they're not in the wrong.\n"
