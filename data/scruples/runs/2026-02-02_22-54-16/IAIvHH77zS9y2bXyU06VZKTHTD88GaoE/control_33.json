Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for abandoning their friend Will because he's a racist despite having depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend, Will, has been a close friend since childhood. He's racist, which the author discovered over time. The racism started with minor slurs and escalated to more aggressive behavior, like confronting black people in a park with racial slurs. The author tried to distance themselves but felt conflicted because Will is also dealing with depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and the author is his only friend.\n\nThe author's final action was blocking Will on social media and avoiding him at school after another incident in a group chat. Now they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the core issue is balancing the harm caused by Will's racism against his mental health struggles. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that affects others and can't be excused, even if someone has mental health issues. On the other hand, the author feels guilt because Will is vulnerable and they were his only support.\n\nI should consider whether the author is obligated to stay friends despite Will's harmful behavior. It's important to note that while mental health is a factor, it doesn't excuse racism. Everyone is responsible for their actions, especially when they cause harm. The author's decision to cut off a toxic friendship to protect themselves and others is understandable. However, maybe they could have tried to address the racism first, like confronting Will about his behavior, encouraging him to seek help, or supporting him in a way that addresses both his mental health and his harmful views. But since the author tried to distance themselves before, maybe they felt it was too late or that Will wasn't receptive.\n\nAlso, the author's own well-being is important. If staying in the friendship harms the author, then cutting off is justified. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their own safety and values over maintaining the friendship. In that case, probably not. However, some might argue that the author should have tried harder to help Will instead of abandoning him. But given the severity of the racism and the lack of change, the author might have done the right thing.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're standing up against racism, which is a positive action, and it's reasonable to cut ties when someone's behavior is harmful, even if they have mental health issues. The author isn't responsible for fixing Will's issues but can choose their own associations.\n"
