Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their best friend Will, who has depression and is a racist. The situation involves Will growing up in a racist environment and displaying increasingly aggressive behavior towards minorities, including using racial slurs and getting into conflicts. The author tried to distance themselves as things got worse but felt conflicted because Will is depressed and alone. The final incident in the group chat was the last straw, leading the author to block him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue, and the author is dealing with someone close who has harmful beliefs. The key points are Will's racist actions, the author's attempts to address them, and the author's decision to end the friendship. \n\nThe author mentions that the racism started small but escalated. They were friends since primary school, but when Will's behavior became aggressive and targeted minorities, the author felt the need to distance. However, since Will is also struggling with depression, anorexia, and self-harm, the author is torn between their responsibility to stand against racism and their concern for Will's well-being.\n\nIn such cases, it's important to recognize that while mental health issues can contribute to someone's behavior, they don't excuse harmful actions like racism. The author's decision to cut off a toxic relationship might be justified to protect themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nThe author tried to engage with Will, as seen when they asked him what was wrong after the park incident. But when Will continued his racist behavior, especially in a group setting where others were present, the author decided to end the friendship. This could be seen as a necessary step to prevent further harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel guilty for not supporting Will through his depression, but staying in a relationship where someone spreads hatred and aggression isn't healthy. The author's responsibility isn't to enable harmful behavior under the guise of friendship. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They are choosing to protect themselves and others from a friend whose behavior is unacceptable. Mental health issues don't absolve someone of their actions, especially when they harm others. The final answer should be B.\n"
