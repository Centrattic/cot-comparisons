Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for abandoning their close friend Will, who has depression and is a racist. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The writer, let's call them Alex, has been friends with Will since primary school. Will has a history of racism, starting with minor slurs and progressing to aggressive behavior towards minorities. Despite Will's issues, Alex is his only friend and feels guilty because Will is depressed, anorexic, anxious, and self-harms.\n\nNow, the question is whether Alex is in the wrong for cutting off contact. Let's break it down. Will's racism is a major issue. Racism is a serious problem that affects others and can cause harm. On the other hand, Will's mental health struggles are also significant. Alex is his only support system, so cutting contact might leave him vulnerable.\n\nBut here's the thing: while Alex might feel guilty for abandoning a friend in need, Will's behavior is harmful. It's about whether Alex is responsible for Will's well-being. People can't be held responsible for others' actions if those actions are harmful. Alex is protecting themselves from Will's toxic behavior, especially since Will's racism is severe and intentional.\n\nAlso, Will's racism is a choice, even if it's rooted in upbringing. Standing by someone who spreads hate, especially when they have the ability to change, can be complicit. Alex's decision to distance themselves could actually be the right step for their own mental health and to avoid endorsing Will's harmful actions.\n\nBut then there's the guilt Alex feels. It's important, but guilt doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong. They did what they felt was necessary for their own safety and well-being. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like encouraging professional help instead of cutting off completely. But given the final straw was Will attacking someone in a group chat, leading to Alex blocking him, it seems justified.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's a tough situation, Alex isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect themselves from harm, even if it means losing a friend. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
