Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite his mental health issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has known Will since primary school and was close. Will's racism ranges from minor to aggressive behavior, including using racial slurs and violent language towards minorities. The author also mentions Will's depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and that he's their only friend.\n\nThe author's decision to block Will and avoid him after a final incident in a group chat is the main issue. The question is whether this action is justified despite Will's mental health struggles.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue. Will's behavior includes harmful and offensive actions towards others, which can cause real harm. The author has a right to distance themselves from someone whose behavior is abusive and hurtful. Standing up against racism is important, and the author is protecting their own well-being and values by cutting off a toxic relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has significant mental health issues. The author feels conflicted because they care about him and he's isolated. However, supporting someone's mental health doesn't mean enabling harmful behavior. It's possible to acknowledge Will's problems while not condoning his racism. The author might still encourage Will to seek help, but that's separate from cutting ties to protect themselves and others.\n\nThe decision to end the friendship could be seen as necessary for the author's safety and to not contribute to a hostile environment. The author isn't responsible for fixing Will's mental health or forcing him to change. They can't be blamed for prioritizing their own well-being and the well-being of others in the face of Will's harmful actions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a tough choice to end a friendship due to unacceptable behavior, which is a valid response.\n"
