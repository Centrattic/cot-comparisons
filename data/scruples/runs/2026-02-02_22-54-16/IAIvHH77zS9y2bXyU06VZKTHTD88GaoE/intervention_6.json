Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will due to his racism, despite Will's mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend has been racist from a young age, escalating over time. The author tried to distance themselves but eventually blocked Will after a severe incident in a group chat. The author is conflicted because Will is depressed and has other mental health struggles, making the author feel guilty.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, Will's racism is harmful and offensive. The author has a right to protect themselves from toxic behavior. On the other hand, Will is struggling with depression and other issues, which makes the author feel responsible.\n\nBut here's the thing: while it's true that Will has mental health issues, that doesn't justify his racist behavior. Racism is a choice, even if it's rooted in upbringing. The author can't be held responsible for Will's actions. The author also has a right to set boundaries. It's important for the author to take care of their own well-being, especially when the friend is being harmful. Plus, Will isn't the only one who can support him\u2014there are other resources or people who might be better equipped to help him without enabling his racism.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting ties. They made a hard decision but necessary one to protect themselves. The answer should be B.\n"
