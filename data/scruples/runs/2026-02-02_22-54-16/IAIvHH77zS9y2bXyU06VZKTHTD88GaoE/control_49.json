Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who cut off their friend Will is in the wrong. The situation involves Will's racism and his mental health issues.\n\nFirst, Will was raised in a racist environment and displayed racist behavior from a young age, escalating over time. The user tried to distance themselves when they realized the severity, but stayed because Will was struggling with depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm. The final incident was Will attacking someone in a group chat, leading the user to cut off contact.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n1. Will's behavior: His racism is harmful and offensive. The examples given, like using racial slurs and aggressive actions, are clear instances of racism that create a hostile environment.\n2. The user's responsibility: They were Will's only friend, and he had mental health issues. The user might feel guilt about abandoning him, but they also have the right to set boundaries against toxic behavior.\n3. The final straw: The recent incident in the group chat was the catalyst for cutting off contact. The user might feel justified in protecting themselves and others from Will's actions.\n4. Mental health considerations: Will's depression and other issues are serious, but they don't excuse his racist behavior. The user isn't responsible for fixing Will's problems, especially when he was the aggressor.\n\nEthically, it's important to protect oneself and others from hate speech and harmful actions. The user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their values and safety. While cutting off a friend can be painful, especially when they're vulnerable, it's a personal choice based on respecting others and self-care. The user might still feel conflicted, but their actions are understandable given the circumstances.\n"
