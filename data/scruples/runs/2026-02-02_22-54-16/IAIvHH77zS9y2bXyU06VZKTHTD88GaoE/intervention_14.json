Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who has depression and is a racist. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, let's call them \"Friend,\" has known Will since childhood. Will has a history of racism, which escalated over time, including using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. Despite this, Will also has mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is Friend's only friend. Friend finally cuts off Will after a recent incident in a group chat involving a black person.\n\nNow, the key points here are the conflict between Will's harmful behavior and his mental health. The question is whether Friend is in the wrong for ending the friendship. \n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue. Supporting or enabling racist behavior can be harmful, not just to the targets but also to society. Friend tried to distance themselves earlier but stayed due to Will's mental state. However, the recent incident was the last straw, leading Friend to cut off contact. This might be a necessary step for Friend's own well-being and to avoid complicity in Will's harmful actions.\n\nOn the other hand, Will's mental health is a factor. He's struggling with several issues and might need support. Friend was his only friend, so cutting off contact could leave him without a support system, potentially worsening his mental health. But does that obligation override the harm Will causes?\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is balancing empathy for Will's struggles with the need to oppose racism. Friend isn't responsible for fixing Will's mental health issues. They can't be expected to stay in a toxic situation if it's harmful to others. However, the abrupt decision might not have considered other options, like seeking professional help for Will or trying to mediate the friendship while setting boundaries.\n\nBut given that Will's behavior was actively harmful and Friend tried to distance themselves before, the final action might be justified. The user's initial thought is that Friend isn't in the wrong, and I need to see if that aligns. \n\nAnother angle: Friend might be protecting themselves and others from Will's racism. By cutting off contact, they're not supporting or enabling his behavior. While it's painful to lose a friend, especially one who's vulnerable, it's about personal boundaries and ethical responsibility. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
