Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, Will has been a close friend since primary school, but he has serious issues. He was raised in a racist household and has shown racist behavior over the years. The author describes instances where Will used racial slurs and targeted minorities. The most recent incident was in a group chat where Will attacked a black person without reason. That's the final straw for the author, who then blocks him and avoids him.\n\nBut Will also has depression, anxiety, anorexia, and self-harms. The author is his only friend, which adds complexity. The question is whether the author made the right decision to abandon him.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious problem and the author has a right to set boundaries. The author is protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. It's understandable not to tolerate racism, especially when it's aggressive and directed at others. The author might feel that they can't support someone with those views, especially given the severity of Will's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, Will is struggling with mental health issues and might be in a vulnerable state. The author is his only friend, so cutting off contact might leave him without support. However, the author might not be responsible for his mental health, especially if Will's racism is a core part of his harmful behavior. It's possible that Will's racist attitudes contribute to his self-harm and depression, or that he needs professional help rather than just friendship.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to protect themselves from toxic behavior versus their responsibility towards a friend in distress. The author didn't cut off Will because he was depressed but because of his racism. The author tried to distance earlier but gave multiple chances. The final incident was a clear boundary crossed. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and standing up against racism, even if it means losing a friend. The answer should be B.\n"
