Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will due to his racism and other issues. The author's friend, Will, has a history of racism, including using racial slurs, making aggressive comments, and even targeting minorities. He also struggles with depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and has the author as his only friend.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is standing up against Will's harmful behavior, which is racism. Racism is a serious issue, and the author might be protecting themselves and others from Will's actions. On the other hand, Will has mental health issues, and the author is his only friend. The author might be cutting off someone who's vulnerable, which could worsen his mental health.\n\nBut the key points here are that Will's racism is intentional and harmful. Even if he was taught that way at home, that doesn't excuse his behavior. The author tried to be a friend but was confronted with Will's aggressive racism. The final straw was in the group chat where Will targeted someone again. The author's action is a response to Will's continued harmful actions despite his personal issues.\n\nMental health doesn't excuse racism. The author is protecting themselves from a toxic relationship. However, maybe the author could have sought other ways to help Will, like encouraging professional help. But given the severity and persistence of Will's racism, cutting off might be necessary for the author's well-being. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
