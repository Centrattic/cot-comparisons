Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend, Will, who is a racist but also has depression and other mental health issues. The author has been friends with him since primary school but is now cutting ties because of Will's racist behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the severity of Will's actions. He's not just making offhand comments; he's using racial slurs, being aggressive towards minorities, and even saying something derogatory like \"their (n-word) faces made me angry.\" That's pretty extreme. The author tried to distance themselves earlier when they noticed the racism, but Will's depression and mental health issues are complicating things.\n\nThe author is conflicted because Will is their oldest friend and he's depressed, but the racist behavior is unacceptable. The final straw was in a group chat where Will targeted a black person. The author blocked him on all social media and avoids him at school. Now they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue, and the author has the right to set boundaries to protect themselves and stand against racism. Will's mental health doesn't excuse his harmful behavior. On the other hand, the author is concerned about Will's well-being, especially since he's their only friend and has issues like anorexia and self-harm. But the author can't be responsible for Will's actions or his mental health. They can't force him to change his views or behaviors. \n\nThe key point is that while the author might feel guilty for cutting off a friend, they are not in the wrong for prioritizing their own mental health and ethical stance against racism. It's important to recognize that supporting someone with mental health issues doesn't mean tolerating harmful behavior. The author made a difficult choice but it's justified given the severity of Will's actions. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
