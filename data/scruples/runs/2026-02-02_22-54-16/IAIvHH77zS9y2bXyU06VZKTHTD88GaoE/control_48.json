Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for abandoning their friend Will because he's a racist, even though Will has depression, anxiety, anorexia, and self-harms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has been friends with Will since primary school and is his only support. Will was raised in a racist environment, which might have influenced his behavior. The author tried to distance themselves earlier but felt compelled to stay due to Will's mental health struggles. However, Will's actions, like using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities, are clearly harmful and offensive. The final incident in the group chat was the last straw, leading the author to block him and avoid him.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off someone with significant mental health issues can be seen as abandoning them when they need support the most. But racism is a serious issue that affects others, and the author might be protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. The author's own well-being is important, and staying in a toxic relationship could be detrimental to them as well.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The decision to end a friendship, especially with someone who has mental health challenges, isn't straightforward. However, racism is a harmful ideology that can't be excused just because of someone's mental health. The author might have tried to handle it earlier but reached a limit. They might be doing what's necessary for their own safety and to avoid perpetuating harmful behavior. Alternatively, they might have a responsibility to support Will despite his flaws, but that's debatable.\n\nI think the key here is that while mental health is a factor, it doesn't justify racist actions. The author is not responsible for Will's racism. Ending the friendship is a personal choice, and given the severity of Will's behavior, the author isn't in the wrong. They might need to consider other ways to help Will, but cutting off is their right. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
