Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by cutting off their friend Will, who has depression and other mental health issues but is also racist.\n\nFirst, the friend grew up in a racist household and developed harmful behaviors. The author mentions instances where Will used racial slurs and targeted minorities, including a specific incident in a park with derogatory language. The author tried to distance themselves before, but because Will was depressed and the author was his only friend, they hesitated. The final incident in the group chat was the last straw, leading to the author cutting off contact.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is it okay to distance oneself from someone with mental health issues if they engage in harmful behavior? The author's actions were in response to Will's racism, which is a serious issue. Mental health struggles don't excuse harmful behavior. However, the author might feel conflicted because Will is in a vulnerable state.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to protect themselves from racism and not enable harmful behavior. On the other hand, cutting off a friend who is struggling might have negative impacts on their mental health. But it's important to note that enabling or tolerating racism can be harmful as well. The author might be making a necessary boundary for their own well-being and to stand against racism.\n\nThe question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If we consider that the author is protecting themselves from racism and not allowing harmful behavior to continue, then they are not in the wrong. However, if the author should have tried to support Will through his mental health issues despite the racism, that could be a different perspective. But it's not reasonable to force someone to befriend someone who is racist. Personal safety and values matter.\n\nSo, the answer seems to be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They made a tough decision to prioritize their values and well-being, which is justified.\n"
