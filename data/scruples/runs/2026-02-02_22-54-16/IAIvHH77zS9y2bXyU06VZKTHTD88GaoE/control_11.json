Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who cut off their friend is at fault. The friend, Will, is described as a racist with severe mental health issues like depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and so on. The author tried to distance themselves over time because of Will's racist behavior, which escalated from minor slurs to outright aggression. The final incident in a group chat was the last straw, leading the author to block him and avoid him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is dealing with a friend who has harmful, prejudiced views that are unacceptable and hurt others. Racism is a serious issue, and enabling such behavior can be harmful. The author might feel conflicted because Will also has mental health struggles, but that doesn't justify the racist actions. The author tried to be a friend and support Will in the past, but the repeated harmful behavior made it impossible to continue the friendship.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting someone off completely might seem harsh, especially when they're struggling with mental health. However, the author's actions could be a necessary step to protect themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. The key here is that the author is not being cruel out of spite but is standing up against racism, which is a significant moral issue. The author might have tried to address the problem in the past without success, so taking this step could be seen as a responsible choice.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could have tried to seek help for Will, like encouraging therapy or support groups. But given the severity of Will's racism and the fact that he's in denial (as he uses racial slurs and blames others for his anger), it's possible that professional help wouldn't be effective. Plus, the author might not be equipped to handle someone with such deep-seated prejudice and mental health issues simultaneously.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on Will's mental health. Is cutting off a friend likely to worsen his depression or self-harm? It could, but the author's priority here is their own well-being and not enabling harmful behavior. It's a tough balance, but the author isn't responsible for fixing Will's issues. They deserve a friendship that's respectful and kind. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. They've taken a stand against racism, which is a positive action. While it's unfortunate for Will, the author's health and the well-being of others in their circle are important too. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
