Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them cutting off their best friend because the friend is a racist, even though the friend has mental health issues. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend, Will, has been a close friend since primary school. The writer became friends with him when they were young, so maybe they didn't realize the racism early on. As they grew older, Will started showing racist behavior, like using racial slurs and targeting minorities. The worst example given is when Will aggressively told two black people to leave a park, using the n-word and other slurs. The writer tried to distance themselves before, but they hadn't cut him off completely until the final incident in a group chat.\n\nNow, Will has depression, anxiety, is anorexic, self-harms, and the writer is his only friend. The writer blocked him on all social media and avoids him at school. They feel conflicted because they don't want to abandon someone who's struggling, but they can't condone the racism.\n\nSo, the key points are: racism is a serious issue, and the writer is protecting themselves and others from Will's harmful behavior. However, Will is vulnerable and in a bad mental state. The writer is cutting off their only friend, which might leave him without support. But is that their responsibility?\n\nOn one hand, you can't be held responsible for someone else's mental health, especially if they're harmful. It's important to set boundaries and protect oneself and others from racism. But on the other hand, maybe the writer could have tried to help Will seek support instead of cutting him off entirely. However, given the severity of the racism and the fact that it's directed at others, not just the writer, it's about protecting others too.\n\nAlso, the writer might not be in a position to handle someone with multiple mental health issues and racism. It's complex, but the final decision was to block him, which is a personal choice. The question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the racism is a significant issue and not something to be tolerated, the writer isn't in the wrong for distancing themselves. They can't be expected to be the sole support system for someone who is harmful. So the answer is B.\n"
