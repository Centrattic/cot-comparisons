Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for abandoning their friend Will because he's a racist, even though he has depression and other mental health issues. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they're at fault for cutting off their best friend who has been making racist remarks and using slurs. The friend was raised in a racist environment, but as they got older, his behavior escalated from minor slurs to aggressive actions. The author mentions that Will also has anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms, which makes them feel guilty about distancing themselves.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of Will's racism and the author's struggle with his mental health. On one hand, racism is a serious issue that can cause harm and is morally wrong. It's important to consider the safety and comfort of others affected by Will's actions. The author tried to distance themselves before but felt compelled to act after a specific incident in the group chat. On the other hand, the author is concerned about Will's well-being since he's their only friend and has significant mental health challenges.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user's action was to block Will and avoid him, which is a form of self-protection and setting boundaries. While they did the person who was directly targeted (the black individual in the group chat) might be more important to consider, the user's own experience and the impact of Will's behavior on others (like the incident in the park) are valid reasons for cutting off. The user might be feeling conflicted because they care about Will's mental state, but they're not responsible for his actions or his upbringing. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and standing against racism, even if their friend has issues. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
