Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The friend, Will, has a history of racist behavior, escalating from slurs to aggressive outbursts. The author tried to distance themselves but eventually blocked Will after a significant incident. The key points here are the severity of Will's racism and the author's decision to cut him off.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. It's not just about personal feelings but also about harmful behavior towards others. The author was put in a position where their friend was targeting minorities, which can create a hostile environment. The author's choice to end the friendship might be justified if they feel they can't support someone with such harmful views, especially when Will's actions were aggressive and hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author is conflicted because Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms. The question is whether the author is at fault for prioritizing their own boundaries and safety over trying to help a friend with mental health issues. But it's important to note that while mental health is important, it doesn't excuse harmful behavior. The author isn't responsible for fixing Will's issues, especially when those issues involve racism.\n\nThe author did try to maintain the friendship despite Will's problems but reached a breaking point. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries when a friend's actions are toxic and harmful. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own well-being and standing against racism. However, they might be advised to consider other ways to support Will, like encouraging professional help, but the decision to end the friendship isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They had valid reasons based on Will's harmful behavior, and cutting off a toxic relationship can be a necessary step for their own mental health and ethical stance against racism.\n"
