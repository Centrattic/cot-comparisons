Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by cutting off their best friend Will because he's a racist despite being depressed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. The author describes instances where Will used racial slurs and targeted minorities, which is harmful and wrong. Standing up against racism is important, and the author might have felt they couldn't support a friend who behaves that way. \n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health issues like depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and was in a racist household. The author mentions they were his only friend, so cutting off the relationship could leave him without support. The author might be struggling with guilt over abandoning someone in need.\n\nThe key here is whether the author acted wrongfully. The author tried to distance themselves earlier but couldn't due to Will's mental health. The final straw was a public racist outburst, leading them to block him. They might have felt that their own mental health or the well-being of others was at risk by continuing the friendship. \n\nBut was cutting off the only option? Could they have tried to address it differently, like talking to Will about his racism or seeking help for him? However, the author might not feel responsible for fixing Will's issues. The question is about personal responsibility and boundaries. \n\nRacism is a choice, even if influenced by upbringing. The author has the right to set boundaries against harmful behavior. While Will's mental health is a factor, the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's toxic. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But maybe some would argue they should have tried more to help, hence A. However, given the severity of the racism, B makes sense.\n"
