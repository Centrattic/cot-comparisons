Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their close friend Will because he's a racist and has depression. The options are A (Yes, they're wrong) or B (No, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author has been friends with Will since primary school. Will was raised in a racist environment and has shown racist behavior over the years, escalating from small slurs to aggressive actions. The author mentions specific incidents where Will used racial slurs and targeted minorities. However, Will also has significant mental health issues: depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is the author's only friend. The author cut off Will after a recent incident in a group chat involving a black person, but feels conflicted because of Will's mental state.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. Will's behavior is harmful and offensive, and the author is justifiably upset. It's reasonable to set boundaries with someone who engages in such behavior, especially if it's consistent and harmful. The author tried to distance themselves before, but the final straw was a recent incident. So, cutting off a friend who is racially abusive can be a valid decision for the author's well-being and values.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has mental health struggles. The author does feel guilty about abandoning him, which shows empathy. However, mental health issues don't excuse harmful behavior. While it's important to support friends with mental health problems, one's own safety and comfort in relationships matter too. The author isn't obligated to stay in a friendship that's toxic or harmful because of Will's issues. Plus, Will's behavior wasn't just occasional; it was ongoing and escalated over time.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had a responsibility to stay as a friend despite Will's racism. But no one is required to tolerate abuse or harmful actions, even if the person is struggling. The author might have tried to support Will in the past, but when the behavior continues and becomes unmanageable, it's acceptable to prioritize their own values and well-being.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting off Will. They faced a difficult situation where they had to protect themselves from a friend whose behavior was unacceptable. The answer should be B (No).\n"
