Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for cutting off their close friend Will because of his racism, despite his mental health issues. \n\nFirst, the friend, Will, has a history of racist behavior that escalated over time. The author initially didn't notice but as they grew older, Will's racism became more aggressive, including using racial slurs and targeting minorities. The final incident happened in a group chat where Will attacked a Black person without reason, leading the author to block him.\n\nNow, the author is conflicted because Will also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms. The author is his only friend. The dilemma here is whether it's wrong to distance oneself from someone with mental health issues despite their harmful behavior.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while mental health is a significant factor, it doesn't excuse racism or harmful actions. People are responsible for their behavior, even if they have mental health challenges. Racism is a choice and a harmful ideology that can cause real harm. The author's decision to protect themselves and others from Will's toxic behavior is understandable. They set a boundary to preserve their own well-being and to stand against racism.\n\nHowever, the author might feel guilty because they care about Will and his mental health struggles. But it's important to recognize that supporting someone's mental health doesn't mean tolerating abusive or racist behavior. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that is toxic and harmful. They can still care about Will's well-being without enabling his harmful actions.\n\nIn some cases, people with mental health issues might need professional help, but that's not the responsibility of the friend. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to protect others and themselves from Will's behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary. The answer should be B (No).\n"
