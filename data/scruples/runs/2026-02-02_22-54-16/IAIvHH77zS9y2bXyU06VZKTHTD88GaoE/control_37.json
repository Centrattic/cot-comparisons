Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for abandoning their friend Will, who has depression, because Will is a racist. The situation is complicated because Will has mental health issues, but he also behaves in racist ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The author has known Will since primary school, so they have a long-standing friendship. Will's racist behavior started early and escalated over time, including using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. Despite this, Will is described as being depressed, anorexic, anxious, and self-harming, with the author being his only friend.\n\nThe author decided to cut off Will after a specific incident in a group chat. They feel conflicted because Will is in a bad mental state, but his actions are unacceptable. The question is about whether the author did the right thing.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who is racist perpetuates harmful behavior. The author might feel that they need to distance themselves to not enable Will's racism. However, considering Will's mental health struggles, cutting off contact completely might hinder his support system. But the author might not be responsible for his mental health, especially if Will's actions are harmful.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have a responsibility as a friend to support Will, but only up to a point where they don't compromise their own values. However, if Will is actively harmful, maybe the author isn't wrong in distancing. But they should consider if there's a way to maintain the friendship while addressing the racism, like encouraging therapy or intervention.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they tried to distance themselves before but couldn't. Now, after the final incident, they took a stand. The conflict here is between moral duty to not support racism and the empathy for Will's mental health.\n\nIn terms of societal views, most people would agree that racism is unacceptable. Supporting someone who is racist could be seen as complicity. However, completely cutting off someone with severe mental health issues might be seen as abandonment. But if the friend is harmful, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own ethics and safety.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because standing against racism is important, and the author has a right to protect themselves from being around someone who is actively harmful. However, it's a nuanced situation where the mental health aspect complicates things. But ultimately, the author isn't responsible for Will's mental health and can't be blamed for prioritizing their own values and the well-being of others.\n"
