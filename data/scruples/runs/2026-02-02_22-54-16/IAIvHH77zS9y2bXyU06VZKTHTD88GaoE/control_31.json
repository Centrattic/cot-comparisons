Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism, despite Will's depression and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend, Will, has been racist since they were teenagers. He started with minor things like using racial slurs behind others' backs and escalated to aggressive behavior towards minorities. The author tried to distance themselves before, but since Will is their only friend and has depression, an eating disorder, anxiety, and self-harms, they felt conflicted. The final straw was a recent incident where Will attacked a black person in a group chat. The author then blocked him and avoids him at school.\n\nSo, the key points are: Will's racism is harmful and has escalated. The author is dealing with his mental health issues but can't tolerate the racism anymore. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friendship.\n\nI need to consider whether the author has the right to set boundaries. Will's racism is a choice that affects others negatively. While his mental health is a factor, his actions are still harmful. The author is not responsible for Will's mental health issues. The decision to leave a toxic or harmful friend is not uncommon. The final incident was a clear trigger, and the author is prioritizing their own values and safety.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author should have tried to help or support Will more. But considering the severity of the racism and that the author is not a professional, it's understandable to seek distance. Will's mental health doesn't excuse his racism; it's a separate issue. The author isn't abandoning Will out of cruelty but because they can't condone or tolerate his behavior anymore.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are setting a boundary for their well-being and against harmful behavior. They can't be blamed for leaving a friend who's causing harm, even if that friend is struggling.\n"
