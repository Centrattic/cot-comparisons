Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The writer's friend, Will, is described as having significant mental health issues\u2014depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm\u2014but also being a racist who uses racial slurs and targets minorities. The writer is struggling with whether they did the right thing by cutting off Will after a final incident in a group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here: the severity of Will's racism and the writer's mental health concerns. The writer has been friends with Will since childhood, which adds emotional weight to the decision to distance themselves. However, Will's behavior includes aggressive racial slurs and targeting minorities, which are serious issues. The writer is also Will's only friend, which complicates the situation because they might feel a sense of responsibility.\n\nOn one hand, the writer is standing up for what's right by not tolerating racism, which is a fundamental human rights issue. They are protecting others from Will's harmful behavior and prioritizing their own well-being. On the other hand, Will is dealing with depression and other mental health issues, which might make the cutoff more difficult for him. But the question is whether the writer is in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nIt's important to note that while the writer might feel guilt because of their history with Will and his mental health, they are not obligated to stay in a toxic or harmful relationship. Will's actions are not excusable based on his background or mental health. The writer's decision to cut off a friend who is actively harmful to others is a valid boundary. Additionally, the fact that Will was raised in a racist environment doesn't justify his behavior; the writer isn't responsible for changing him.\n\nHowever, the writer might consider seeking support for Will through professional help, but that's different from being in the wrong for ending the friendship. The final straw was a direct attack in a group chat, which the writer couldn't ignore. The answer would likely lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong, because they are protecting others and themselves from harmful behavior. They can't be held responsible for Will's upbringing or mental health choices, and their decision to set a boundary is justified.\n"
