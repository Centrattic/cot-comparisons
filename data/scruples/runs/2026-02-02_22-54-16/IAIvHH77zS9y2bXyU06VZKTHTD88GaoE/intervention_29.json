Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will, who has depression but is also a racist. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to figure out the answer.\n\nFirst, racists are harmful, and their behavior is unacceptable. The author describes Will's actions as escalating over time\u2014starting with slurs behind others' backs, then aggressive outbursts, including using a racial slur and telling people to leave. The final straw was an online attack. These actions are clearly racist and hurtful.\n\nWill also has mental health issues: anorexia, anxiety, depression, self-harm. The author feels conflicted because Will is their oldest friend and seems isolated. But the author is now distancing themselves due to Will's behavior.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author is standing up against racism, which is a moral stance. 2) They're concerned about Will's mental health but feel justified in cutting ties because of his harmful actions. \n\nRacism is a choice, even if rooted in upbringing. Supporting someone who spreads hate can enable harmful behavior. The author might be protecting themselves and others, not just from Will's racism but also from being complicit in it. However, the author might also feel guilt for abandoning a friend in need, which is understandable. But they aren't obligated to stay in a toxic friendship that harms others. The author's action could encourage Will to seek help, though it's not their responsibility to fix his issues.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off without trying to address the issue directly first might be a point against them. But given the escalation and the final incident in the group chat, it's a breaking point. The author might have tried before to distance but found it difficult due to Will's mental health. In this case, the author's decision to leave is about self-respect and not enabling racism, which is more important than maintaining the friendship at the expense of others' well-being.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
