Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone named Will, who's been a close friend since primary school. The author is asking if they're at fault for cutting off Will because of his racism, even though Will has depression and other issues like anorexia, anxiety, and self-harm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has known Will since they were very young, which means there's a long-standing friendship. Will was raised in a racist environment, leading him to adopt racist beliefs. The author noticed increasing racist behavior over time, including using racial slurs and aggressive behavior towards minorities. The final straw was when Will targeted a black person in a group chat, leading the author to block him and avoid him at school. However, Will also has significant mental health issues, including depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and being his only friend complicates the situation for the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, racism is a serious issue. The author has been trying to distance themselves from Will's behavior, which escalated over time. The author's decision to cut off contact might be a way to protect themselves and others from Will's harmful actions. They might feel that they can't support Will's mental health issues while he continues to be racist.\n\nOn the other hand, Will is struggling with depression and other issues, and the author was his only friend. The author might be feeling conflicted about abandoning him, especially since he's in a vulnerable state. There's a question of responsibility here: does the author have a duty to continue supporting Will despite his racism, or is it acceptable to prioritize their own values and the well-being of others?\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's actions are justified given the severity of Will's racism. While mental health is important, it doesn't excuse racist behavior. The author might be standing up against discrimination, which is a positive action. However, completely cutting off a long-time friend, especially someone in crisis, can have negative consequences. The author might be avoiding the responsibility of supporting Will through his issues, but that's a different matter.\n\nIt's also worth considering if there were other options the author could have explored before cutting off contact. For example, perhaps confronting Will about his racism, seeking counseling together, or trying to get him help for both his mental health and his prejudices. However, given the severity of Will's behavior, the author might have felt that those steps weren't effective or safe.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they're not responsible for Will's upbringing or mental health issues. They have the right to set boundaries, especially regarding harmful behaviors. However, completely severing a relationship might be abrupt. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to protect others and themselves from Will's harmful actions, even if it means Will is left in a difficult place. The key is balancing accountability for Will's actions with the desire to be compassionate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision to distance themselves is a personal choice, the question is whether it's fair to say they're in the wrong. Since supporting a friend's harmful behavior isn't acceptable, and the author's well-being and others' safety matter, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They're making a tough choice to prioritize their values and safety, even if it comes at the cost of a friendship.\n"
