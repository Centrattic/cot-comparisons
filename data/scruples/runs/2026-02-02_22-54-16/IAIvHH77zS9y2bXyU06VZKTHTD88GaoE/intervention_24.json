Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will due to Will's racism. The situation is complex because Will has depression, anorexia, anxiety, and self-harms. The author has been friends with him since primary school.\n\nFirst, the key issue is Will's racism. The author describes escalating behavior from racial slurs to aggressive confrontations. The final trigger was Will attacking someone in a group chat. The author felt compelled to cut off contact, even though Will is struggling with mental health issues and has no other friends. \n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue that can't be excused, even if it's rooted in upbringing. The author is taking a stand against harmful and offensive behavior. It's important to support others who are targeted by racism. Also, the author's mental well-being might be affected by being around someone who makes them uncomfortable or causes distress.\n\nOn the other hand, Will has significant mental health challenges. The author might feel guilty for abandoning him, especially since he's isolated. However, supporting someone who is a bully or harmful to others is complicated. The author might have tried to distance themselves earlier but couldn't until the final incident.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and standing against racism. It's possible to acknowledge Will's struggles while recognizing that his actions are unacceptable. The author isn't responsible for Will's mental health; they can't be expected to be the sole support system for someone who also harms others. The answer should be B (No), because the author is justified in cutting off a friend whose behavior is harmful and racist, especially after repeated incidents and with the final straw in the group chat. The author isn't at fault for setting boundaries in their own life.\n"
