Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because he's a racist despite having depression and other mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a long-standing friendship with Will, but Will's racism has become increasingly problematic. The examples given include using racial slurs, aggressive behavior towards minorities, and a major incident where he used a slur and told them to leave. The author tried to distance themselves before but finally blocked him after another incident. However, Will also has depression, anorexia, anxiety, self-harm, and is socially isolated with the author as his only friend.\n\nThe core issue is whether it's wrong to cut off a friend with mental health issues because of their harmful behavior. On one hand, racism is harmful and the author has a right to distance themselves from toxic behavior. On the other hand, Will is struggling and the author might feel guilt for abandoning him.\n\nI should consider if the author did everything possible to help Will before cutting off. The author mentions trying to distance but not necessarily confronting or seeking help. However, when someone's behavior is actively harmful and they don't change despite attempts, self-preservation is valid. Also, Will's racism is not an excuse for his actions; even if he has mental health issues, that doesn't justify racism.\n\nThe author's decision to block him after repeated incidents could be seen as necessary for their own well-being. The guilt is understandable, but the actions are justified given the severity of Will's behavior. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B)."
