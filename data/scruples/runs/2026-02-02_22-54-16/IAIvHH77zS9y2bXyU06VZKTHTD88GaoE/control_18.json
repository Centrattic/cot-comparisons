Will is a racist.\n\nHe was brought up in a racist household and was taught that he was racially superior to others, of course when I became friends with him when I was 5 or 6, I didn\u2019t really know much about all of that. \n\nBy the time we were teenagers I really began to see how racist he was; it started off with him just doing small things like if he was annoyed with someone he\u2019d whisper to me behind that guy\u2019s back a racial slur directed at him, so that\u2019s pretty minor and that\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut it got worse, by the time we were 16, he was quite an agressive person, he would commonly get in spats, and he would often target minorities. This one time we were walking in a park and we encountered two black people in the year below. I was friends with one of the guys so I was being friendly, but Will, on the other hand, told them to leave aggressively (using many swears and racial slurs). They left in a bit of dismay and I was quite shocked and I asked him what was wrong, and he said quite simply \n\u201ctheir (n-word) faces made me angry\u201d\n\nSo at this point I wanted to distance myself from Will, but there\u2019s another thing, Will is really depressed. He is anorexic because he\u2019s insecure about his weight, he\u2019s Anxious about most things, and I\u2019m his only friend. Alongside this, he confessed to me he self harms which of course is very serious.\n\nSo yeah, last week we were in a group chat, and there was a black person in it, and Will being Will just went at this guy for no reason, and this was the final straw. I blocked him on all social media\u2019s and I completely avoid him at school. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but the fact that he is depressed and in a bad place still eats at me. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend Will because of his racism. The friend is also dealing with depression, anxiety, anorexia, and self-harm. The author wanted to distance themselves but felt conflicted because of Will's mental health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been friends with Will since primary school, which is a long time. Will's behavior includes racial slurs, aggression towards minorities, and using hate speech. The author tried to distance themselves before but maybe didn't cut off completely until a recent incident in a group chat. The author is now avoiding Will entirely and is questioning if they're in the wrong because of Will's mental health issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, Will has serious mental health issues and is socially isolated. On the other hand, his behavior is racist and harmful. The author is standing up against racism by cutting off a friend, which could be seen as a positive action. However, they might be criticized for not trying to help Will more, especially since he's struggling.\n\nBut the author might not have the capacity to support someone with such deep-seated issues, especially if the racism is active and harmful. It's important to recognize that being a supportive friend doesn't mean tolerating harmful behavior. The author is prioritizing their own boundaries and not enabling Will's racism. \n\nAlso, the fact that Will was taught racism from a young age doesn't excuse his behavior, but it shows it's ingrained. The author might not be able to change that alone. Ending the friendship to protect their values and mental well-being is a valid choice. The author's guilt over Will's mental health is understandable, but they aren't responsible for his actions or his healing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're protecting themselves from toxic behavior and aren't obligated to stay in a harmful friendship, even if the person is struggling. It's possible Will needs professional help, which the author can't provide. The author's decision is about their own well-being and standing against racism, which is justified.\n"
