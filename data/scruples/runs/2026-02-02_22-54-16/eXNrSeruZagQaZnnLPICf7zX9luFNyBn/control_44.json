We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is \"in the wrong\" (AITA) for telling the hosts of their D&D game that their baby is causing problems.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple hosts D&D games every week, and after having a baby, the baby is becoming a distraction. The baby is mobile, loud, and once required an ER visit. The wife leaves the table often, which disrupts the game. The group eventually agrees it's an issue, and one of the DMs brings it up to the couple. The wife is upset, stops participating, and the author feels bad for her. The author wasn't the one to bring it up but is part of the group that agreed it was an issue. They also mention not wanting to suggest a babysitter due to financial reasons.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author didn't directly bring up the issue, but they were part of the group that felt it was a problem. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were appropriate. The author says they didn't want to be the one to mention the baby, but others in the group did. The problem is that the baby is causing disruptions. The author's empathy is clear, but they allowed the situation to continue for a few months before it was addressed. The group consensus was that the baby was an issue, but how was that communicated? If the author was part of that consensus but didn't speak up, maybe they contributed to the problem by not addressing it earlier. However, the author might have been hesitant to hurt their friend's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife was upset and felt excluded. The author wanted her to be part of the game. But the group's enjoyment is also important. The author's role wasn't to be the one to bring it up, but they still agreed it was an issue. The question is whether the author is at fault for being part of the group that raised the issue, even though they weren't the one to directly confront the hosts.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't personally bring it up. The group had a consensus and one of the DMs did the hard part. The author's empathy is valid, but they were part of a collective decision. The couple is responsible for managing their own game environment. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
