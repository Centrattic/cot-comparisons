We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing distractions. The author and others felt the baby was affecting their game experience, and one of the DMs brought it up with the hosts, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the group.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The game was hosted at the couple's home for three years. After the baby was born, the baby's presence became disruptive\u2014noisy, causing interruptions, even a trip to the ER once. The group tried to deal with it for months, but eventually, a DM addressed it. The wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nThe author didn't bring up the issue themselves but was part of the consensus that the baby was a problem. They also empathize with the wife and feel bad about the situation, especially since the husband lost his job and suggesting a babysitter might be insensitive.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the impact on the group's enjoyment versus the hosts' personal circumstances. The group's primary purpose is to unwind, and the baby's interruptions were causing stress. However, the hosts are friends, and the wife was newly joining the games, so her exclusion is a significant social issue.\n\nThe author didn't directly confront the hosts but was part of the group that felt the need to address it. Since the DM brought it up, the author might not be the one to blame. However, the way the issue was handled could be problematic. The wife's reaction suggests that the conversation was hurtful, possibly making her feel unappreciated or unwelcome. The author's empathy indicates they care about her feelings, but the group's need for a stress-free environment is also valid.\n\nIs it the author's fault? They didn't act unilaterally, but being part of a group that collectively decided the baby was an issue and then having that discussed with the hosts could share some responsibility. However, the DM was the one to raise the issue, so maybe the author isn't directly at fault. The question is whether the group's approach was considerate enough. Since the author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up and felt guilty, they might not be in the wrong. The main issue is the handling of the conversation rather than the author's role in agreeing it was a problem. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if the author's inaction or participation in the group's decision makes them responsible. The author didn't push for a solution like a babysitter, which might have been considerate. But the problem was already affecting everyone's experience, so not addressing it could also be unkind. It's a bit of a tough call, but since the author didn't directly confront the hosts and felt empathy, the answer is likely B.\n"
