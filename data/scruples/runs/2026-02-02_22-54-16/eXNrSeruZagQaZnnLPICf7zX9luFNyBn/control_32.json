We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's becoming a distraction during game nights. The author didn't start the conversation but is part of a group that eventually did, after trying to handle it for months.\n\nFirst, the hosts are friends and have been hosting for three years. They put effort into setting up their space. The baby's presence is causing issues\u2014noise, people leaving the table, even an ER visit. The group collectively felt it was affecting their enjoyment. The DMs brought it up, and the wife reacted negatively, feeling excluded. The author feels bad because they wanted her to be part of the group.\n\nThe key points here are: did the author do something wrong? The author didn't bring up the issue themselves, but as part of the group that supported bringing it up. The problem was that the baby was a distraction, and the group needed to address it for their enjoyment. However, the way it was communicated might have been hurtful. The wife felt like she couldn't play anymore, leading to her withdrawing.\n\nThe author's intent wasn't to exclude the wife but to resolve the problem. They also considered the financial situation of the hosts. However, maybe the group could have approached the conversation more sensitively, perhaps suggesting alternatives like a babysitter or a different time, even if money was tight. But since the group as a whole felt the issue was affecting everyone, it's understandable they needed to address it. The author isn't the one who initiated the talk, but they were part of the group that reached a consensus. The real fault might lie in how the DMs presented the issue, but the author isn't directly responsible for that. The author's empathy is shown, so they aren't the antagonist. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the group needed to address a collective problem, and the author was part of that consensus without personal malice.\n"
