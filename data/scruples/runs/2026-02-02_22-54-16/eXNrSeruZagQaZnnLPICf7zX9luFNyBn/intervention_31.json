We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the D&D situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The group plays D&D weekly at the hosts' home for three years. The hosts are friends, and they've been accommodating. Then the hosts have a baby, which has become a distraction. The baby is loud, mobile, causing disruptions, even a trip to the ER. The group's enjoyment is affected because the parents have to leave the game to take care of the baby, leading to missed storylines and delays. \n\nThe author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue, but when the DM brought it up, the wife reacted strongly, saying she can't play anymore and withdrew. The author feels bad because they value the friendship with the wife. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is part of the group that found the baby a distraction but didn't bring it up themselves, waiting for the DM to do so. The outcome was the wife leaving the group, which is a significant consequence. \n\nOn one hand, the group's right to expect a suitable environment for their game is valid. They pay for their time and space, and the baby's presence is affecting their experience. On the other hand, the hosts are doing a favor by opening their home, and having a baby is part of their life. The author's intention wasn't to exclude the wife but to address the practical issue. However, the way the issue was raised might have been harsh, especially since the wife took it as a personal attack. \n\nThe author didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue, possibly to avoid conflict, and deferred to the DM. But the collective decision to express the problem led to negative consequences. The author might not be directly at fault for how the DM communicated it, but they might share some responsibility in not finding a more compassionate solution. \n\nHowever, the main issue is the group's right to a distraction-free environment versus the hosts' personal situation. The author's actions were to voice a concern they and others shared, which is understandable. The problem might lie more with how the issue was communicated rather than the issue itself. Since the author took empathy into account and felt guilty, it shows they care, but the outcome was still negative. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the author isn't malicious. They tried to address a shared problem but didn't handle it in a way that considered the personal impact on the wife. But they might not be in the wrong entirely. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but with caveats about communication and empathy.\n"
