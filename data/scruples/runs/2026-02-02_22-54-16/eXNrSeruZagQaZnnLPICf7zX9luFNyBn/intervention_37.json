We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions. The author is part of the group and, after the baby became a distraction, the group as a whole decided it was an issue. The DMs brought up the problem with the hosts, and the wife was really upset, leading to her leaving the group chats and not playing anymore. The author feels bad because they care about the wife as a friend and didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The host couple provides a space and resources for the group's weekly game nights. The baby's presence is causing problems: noise, interruptions, even a trip to the ER once. The group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. However, when the issue was brought up, the wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded, and now there's tension.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. They didn't bring up the issue directly, but others did. The author empathizes with the wife and feels guilty. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, or if the group's reaction was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their game nights without unnecessary disruptions. The baby's presence is causing real issues that impact everyone. The group came to a consensus, so bringing up the issue wasn't just one person's opinion. On the other hand, the wife's emotional response suggests that the way the issue was raised might have been hurtful. The hosts might have felt attacked, especially since the wife was trying to participate in the games after not being able to before the baby was born.\n\nBut the author didn't bring up the issue themselves. They were part of the group that felt the baby was a problem, so maybe the blame isn't on them. The real issue might be how the DMs approached the hosts. The wife's reaction could be due to feeling that her participation was being invalidated. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't confront the hosts directly and expressed empathy towards the wife.\n\nHowever, maybe the group's approach was to blame the hosts for the baby's presence, which is a part of their life. Suggesting a solution like a babysitter could be seen as a more compassionate approach. But the author didn't suggest that, and the group might have just focused on the problem without offering alternatives, leading to the wife's hurt feelings.\n\nSo, the author isn't the one who brought it up, but the group as a whole might have handled it poorly. The author's guilt might be misplaced if they were part of the group that agreed to the issue but didn't take responsibility for how it was communicated. However, since the author didn't directly confront the hosts and felt empathy, they might not be in the wrong. The main fault could lie with how the issue was raised, not necessarily the author's participation in the group's consensus.\n"
