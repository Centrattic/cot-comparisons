We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their story again.\n\nThey're part of a D&D group that meets weekly at a couple's house. The hosts are friends, and they've been doing this for three years. The hosts have a baby now, which is causing some issues. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. There was even an instance where the baby ended up in the ER during a game night. The wife started playing, which was great, but the baby's presence is making it hard for everyone to enjoy the game. The author didn't bring it up directly but others did, and the wife reacted badly, pulling out of the group chats.\n\nThe author feels bad because they care about the wife and don't want her to feel excluded. They also don't want to suggest paying for a babysitter because the husband lost his job. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for contributing to this issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if bringing up the baby as an issue is reasonable. The group was affected by the baby's behavior, and the game nights were supposed to be their time to unwind. If the baby is causing stress and disrupting the games, it's a valid concern. The author didn't bring it up directly but was part of a consensus that the baby was an issue. So maybe they're not to blame for the problem itself.\n\nHowever, the way the issue was communicated might be a problem. The DM brought it up, and the wife took it as a personal attack, feeling excluded. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, which shows they were trying to be considerate. But since the group did address it, the problem wasn't the author's fault. They were part of a collective decision to bring up the issue when it was affecting everyone's enjoyment.\n\nThe author also mentions empathy for the wife and not wanting to suggest a babysitter due to financial constraints. That shows they were trying to balance the group's needs with the hosts' situation. The real issue here might be how the DM communicated the concern, making the wife feel like she can't play anymore. The author didn't do anything wrong by expressing the group's concerns as part of the consensus. They were trying to find a solution that respects everyone, including the hosts' circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were addressing a legitimate problem that affected the group, but the way the DM handled it might be the real issue. The author tried to be empathetic and avoid being the one to bring up the topic, which shows they cared about the friends' feelings.\n"
