We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, leading to interruptions and stress. They waited for someone else (a DM) to bring up the issue, and after it was discussed, the wife was upset and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group has been meeting for 3 years, and the hosts are friends. The baby is a new element that's affecting the game experience. The author isn't the DM, so they didn't take initiative to address it, but others did. The problem is that the wife felt excluded and is upset. The user is wondering if the author is wrong for contributing to this situation.\n\nThe key points here are: the group collectively agreed the baby was an issue, the author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, and the DM did. The wife's reaction was strong, but the author feels empathy. The author is not suggesting a solution like a babysitter due to financial reasons.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author didn't directly confront the hosts but was part of a group that agreed the baby was a problem. They might feel guilty because they didn't act themselves, but since others did, maybe they're not at fault. However, the group's collective action led to the wife's distress. The author's main concern is about their own role in this.\n\nThe options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Considering that the author was part of the group that acknowledged the problem and didn't take personal action, but others did, it's more about the group's decision. The author's intention was to address the issue to enjoy the game, which is understandable. They also considered the wife's feelings and the financial situation. So, it's more about the group dynamic than the author's individual wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
