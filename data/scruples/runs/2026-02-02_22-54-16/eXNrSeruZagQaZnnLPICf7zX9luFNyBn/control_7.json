We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's causing distractions. The author of the post wasn't the one who brought up the issue but was part of the group consensus that the baby was a problem. The DMs then talked to the hosts, and the wife was really upset, saying she couldn't play ever again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group has been meeting for three years, and the hosts go out of their way to provide space and snacks. The baby is mobile, loud, and has led to an ER visit once. It's causing stress for everyone, and the games aren't fun anymore. The author felt it was affecting everyone's enjoyment, especially since they're busy adults who need to unwind.\n\nThe key points here are whether bringing up the issue was necessary and how it was communicated. The author wasn't the one who initiated the conversation but was part of the consensus. The problem is that the wife took it personally and stopped participating, which the author is upset about because they're friends. \n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their game nights without unnecessary stress. The baby's presence is causing frequent interruptions and affecting the game's flow. On the other hand, the hosts have a baby, which is a significant life event, and suggesting a babysitter might be a financial burden, especially since the husband lost his job. \n\nThe author didn't directly confront the hosts but was part of the group consensus. However, when the DMs brought it up, the wife's reaction was extreme. Maybe the way the feedback was delivered was harsh, making the wife feel excluded. The author is empathetic and feels responsible for her withdrawal. \n\nIs the author at fault? They expressed a valid concern shared by the group. The issue was real, but the handling of the conversation might have been flawed. The author didn't suggest alternatives like a babysitter, which could have been a more constructive approach. However, given the husband's unemployment, asking for money might not be feasible. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the feedback was given in a considerate manner. Since the author wasn't the one to deliver the feedback, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely theirs. But being part of the consensus and not offering solutions could contribute to the problem. However, the main fault might lie with how the DMs approached the hosts, not the author's initial concerns. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they voiced a shared concern, especially given the impact on the group's enjoyment. The main issue was the method of communication by the DMs. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
