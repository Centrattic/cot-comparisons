We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong (AITA) for bringing up the issue of the baby affecting their D&D game. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The hosts of the D&D game have a baby now. The baby is causing distractions, making it hard for everyone to enjoy the game. The author mentions that the others agreed the baby was a problem. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so one of the DMs did, and the wife took it really badly, saying she can't play anymore and has left the group chats.\n\nThe author feels bad because they want to include their friend (the wife) and don't want to make her feel excluded. They also don't think they should suggest a babysitter because of financial issues. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being part of the group that raised the issue.\n\nSo, the main points are: the baby is an issue, others agree, the author didn't directly bring it up but was part of the consensus. The problem is that the wife felt excluded, and the author is upset about that.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were trying to address a problem that was affecting everyone's enjoyment. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up and let the DM handle it. They also considered the financial situation of the hosts. \n\nBut the wife's reaction was intense. Maybe she felt like her presence as a player was being criticized because of her baby. The author might have thought that the baby was the issue, not her participation. However, the wife might have felt that the group is not accepting of her new role as a parent, leading to her feeling excluded.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They were trying to solve a problem that was causing stress for everyone. They didn't act out of malice but out of wanting to maintain the group's enjoyment. However, they didn't handle it in a way that considered the wife's feelings adequately. Maybe they should have approached it more sensitively, perhaps addressing the baby's impact without making it seem like a criticism of the wife's ability to parent or participate. The author's empathy for her feelings shows they care, but the way the issue was raised might have been hurtful. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were addressing a legitimate issue, but they could have done it more carefully. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no), the consensus is likely B. The problem was real, and the author wasn't the one who brought it up directly. The main fault might lie with the DM for how they communicated it, not the author.\n"
