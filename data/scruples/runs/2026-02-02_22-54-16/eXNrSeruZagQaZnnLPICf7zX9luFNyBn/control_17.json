We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing issues during game nights. The author, along with others, thought the baby was a distraction and affecting everyone's enjoyment. They eventually brought it up, but the wife was upset and left the group.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is whether it was wrong for the author to point out the baby as a problem. The author mentions that the baby is loud, disruptive, and even caused an ER visit once. The group agreed it was an issue, and they tried to handle it for months before one of the DMs brought it up. The author didn't mention it directly but felt empathy when the wife left.\n\nThe author's intentions seem to be about wanting to enjoy game nights, which are important for stress relief. However, they also value their friendship with the wife. The problem arose when the DM brought it up, and the wife took it personally, feeling excluded. The author didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter due to financial concerns of the hosts. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author didn't start the conversation but was part of the group that felt the baby was problematic. They may have contributed to the group consensus that led to the DM bringing it up. But the author tried to avoid being the one to mention it, showing they were aware of the sensitivity. The wife's reaction was extreme, but the group's right to enjoy their hobby is also valid. \n\nIn such situations, communication is key. The group might have needed to approach the hosts gently, perhaps suggesting solutions like a babysitter if possible. However, the author didn't push for that and instead stayed silent, which might not be their fault since they aren't the host or DM. The main issue was the way the DM presented the problem, which the author didn't control. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? They expressed concern but didn't act in a way that caused direct harm. The blame might lie more with how the DM communicated the issue rather than the author. The author's empathy towards the wife's feelings shows they didn't want to hurt her. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. However, technically, the author shared the group's concerns and didn't act alone, so they might not be entirely responsible.\n"
