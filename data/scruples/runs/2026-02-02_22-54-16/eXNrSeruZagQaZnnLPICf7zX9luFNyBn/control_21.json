We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's causing distractions. The author talks about how the baby is loud, mobile, and even led to an ER visit once. The baby's presence is disrupting the game, making people miss parts of the story, and causing stress. The group eventually brings it up to the hosts, but the wife takes it badly and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that everyone in the group agreed the baby was an issue. They had game nights at the hosts' home, and the hosts went out of their way to accommodate them. The author isn't the DM, so they didn't want to bring up the issue themselves. The problem arose when the DMs did bring it up, and the wife reacted negatively. The author feels bad because they wanted the wife to stay involved.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the a**hole here. The key points are: the baby's behavior is affecting everyone's enjoyment, the group collectively decided it was a problem, and the author supported bringing it up. However, the wife felt excluded, which is a valid emotion. The author is empathetic but also concerned about suggesting a babysitter due to financial issues.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in group activities, communication is important. If the group is collectively bothered by the baby's impact, it's reasonable to discuss it. The hosts might not have realized the extent of the problem. However, the way the issue was raised might not have been sensitive enough. The author didn't directly confront the hosts but waited for the DMs to do so. The wife's reaction shows she felt personally attacked, which is understandable since the baby is part of her family.\n\nBut the group's right to have a good experience is also valid. They're adults using their limited free time. However, the hosts are providing a space and resources, so there's a balance. The author's intention wasn't to exclude the wife but to address a shared problem. The problem might be more about how the issue was communicated rather than the existence of the problem itself. The author didn't act alone, so maybe not solely responsible. But they did support the discussion.\n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the group as a whole decided to address the issue, and the author was part of that collective decision. The problem was the communication method, not the act of bringing it up. The hosts needed to know, and the group's concern was about their shared enjoyment. However, the sensitivity of the approach might have been lacking. But the author isn't solely at fault here. So, B.\n"
