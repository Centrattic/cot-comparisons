We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is at fault for bringing up the issue of the baby affecting their D&D game. \n\nFirst, the context: The group has been playing D&D for three years at the hosts' home. The hosts are a married couple, and after having a baby, the baby's presence is causing disruptions. The baby is mobile, loud, and has even led to an ER visit. The wife started playing, but the baby's interruptions are causing issues for the game. The author didn't bring it up but mentions that others agreed it was a problem. A DM finally addressed it, and the wife reacted negatively.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. The author states that the group collectively felt the baby was an issue, but the DM ended up confronting the couple. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, maybe to avoid conflict, which is understandable. However, the problem is whether that action (the author not speaking up) makes them at fault.\n\nThe author expressed empathy for the wife's feelings, which is good, but they might have contributed to the problem by not helping to address it earlier. If everyone was on board and the issue was affecting everyone's enjoyment, maybe the author should have found a way to communicate this respectfully before it escalated. However, the author wasn't the one who brought it up; the DM did. The author's role here seems to be more of a participant who agreed with the problem but didn't act. \n\nBut was it the author's responsibility to speak up? The group dynamic is complex here. The couple is hosting and providing space, which is a big deal. Suggesting they need a babysitter might have been a sensitive topic, especially with the husband unemployed. The author might feel they didn't want to add financial stress. But not addressing the issue allowed it to fester, leading to the wife's harsh reaction. The author's inaction might be seen as a failure to contribute to a solution, but they weren't the one who approached the couple. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction was extreme. She took it as a personal attack, which might not be fair. The group's concern is about the practical impact on the game, not a judgment on her parenting. The author's empathy is there, but they might feel they were caught between supporting a friend and maintaining the group's activities. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author isn't directly responsible for the DM's approach, but maybe they could have handled it differently. However, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't confront the couple and instead waited for someone else to do it, maybe they aren't at fault. The real problem is the DM's handling of the conversation and the couple's reaction. The author's intent was to support the group and the friend, but the outcome was negative. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to balance group needs and their friend's feelings but didn't want to cause more stress. The fault might lie more with the DM's approach or the wife's reaction. The author's inaction isn't the primary issue here; it's the lack of a constructive solution that everyone could agree on.\n"
