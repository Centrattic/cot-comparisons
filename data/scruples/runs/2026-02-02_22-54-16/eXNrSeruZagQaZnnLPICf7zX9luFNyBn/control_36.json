We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing issues during game nights. The author is questioning if they're at fault for bringing up the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The hosts are friends who've hosted for three years, providing space, snacks, etc. When they had a baby, it became a distraction. The baby is mobile, loud, and even caused an ER visit once. The wife joined the game but had to leave often to take care of the baby. The group eventually brought it up, but the wife took it badly, saying she can't play anymore. The author feels bad because they wanted her included but the game became stressful.\n\nThe main question is whether it's wrong for the author to have discussed the baby's impact. Let's break it down. The group collectively decided the baby was an issue affecting their enjoyment. The author wasn't the one to bring it up first; one of the DMs did. However, the author is feeling guilty because the wife is upset and has left the group chats.\n\nIs the author responsible for the DM bringing it up? The author didn't take the lead but was part of the consensus that the baby was an issue. But the DM was the one to actually talk to the couple. The author might feel complicit because they agreed with the problem but didn't act alone. However, since the DM initiated the conversation, maybe the author isn't the one at fault.\n\nAlso, the author tried to empathize with the wife and didn't suggest a babysitter due to the husband losing his job. So they considered the hosts' financial situation. The problem is the baby's impact on the game's enjoyment, but the hosts have a right to manage their home as they see fit. Maybe the group should have found a compromise first, like playing elsewhere or adjusting schedules when the baby is up. But the group did try for months before addressing it. The wife's reaction is extreme, but the group had a right to express their concerns since they're all friends. \n\nThe author's intention was to maintain the game's quality and their own enjoyment, but the outcome was the wife being excluded. However, the group collectively decided it was an issue, so it's not solely the author's fault. The wrong here might be more on the DM for how they approached the conversation, but the question is about the author. The author isn't in the wrong because they were part of a group decision and didn't force the DM to act. They also showed empathy and didn't make demands. So probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
