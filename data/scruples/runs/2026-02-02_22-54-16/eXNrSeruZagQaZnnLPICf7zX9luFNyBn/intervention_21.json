We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts had a baby, which started causing issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is distracting, causing interruptions, and even led to an ER visit. The group eventually discussed it with the hosts, but the wife reacted negatively, feeling excluded. The author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The hosts have been hosting the group for three years, providing a space and supplies. Then a baby was born, which changed the dynamics. The author isn't the DM but felt the baby was a problem. The group discussed it, and the wife was upset. The author feels bad because they wanted the wife to be included.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the group's game nights are important to them as a way to unwind. It's reasonable for them to want a distraction-free environment. However, the hosts have a new baby, which is a significant life change. The author didn't bring up the issue themselves but waited for the DM to do so. The wife's reaction suggests she felt her participation was being taken away, which is understandable.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They didn't demand the baby to be excluded but expressed a collective concern. The hosts might need to find a solution, like a babysitter or changing the venue. The author didn't suggest financial help, which is a valid consideration given the husband's job loss. However, the group's right to enjoy their hobby should be balanced with the hosts' new circumstances.\n\nThe author's empathy for the wife shows they care about her feelings, but the main issue is whether the group's needs were valid. Since the baby was causing actual disruptions and affecting everyone's experience, it's fair to address it. However, the way it was brought up might have been abrupt. The wife might have felt blindsided, leading to her reaction.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out a real issue affecting the group, but maybe the approach could have been more considerate. Since the DM brought it up, not the author, and the author expressed empathy, it's a nuanced situation. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the group's concerns are valid and the author acted in a collective decision.\n"
