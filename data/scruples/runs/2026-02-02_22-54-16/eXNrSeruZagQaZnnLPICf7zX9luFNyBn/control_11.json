We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about a D&D game group that's been meeting at a couple's house for 3 years. They had a baby, which is causing disruptions. The author is part of the group and didn't bring up the issue themselves, but others did. The wife got upset and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author's actions were wrong. The author didn't directly confront the hosts but others did. The main issue is the baby being a distraction. The author mentions that the group collectively felt it was affecting their enjoyment. But the wife felt excluded, which makes the author feel bad.\n\nThe author didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter, which the husband is unemployed. So, the author didn't push for a solution that might be financially difficult for the hosts. They also didn't act as the DM, so maybe they felt less responsibility.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key points are intent, communication, and empathy. The author had good intentions, tried to be empathetic, but the action of letting the DM bring up the issue might have been necessary if the group consensus was that it was a problem. However, the way the issue was raised led to the wife feeling excluded. \n\nThe author isn't directly at fault because they didn't confront the hosts and were part of a group decision. But maybe they should have considered a more sensitive approach. However, the main person who caused the wife's reaction was the DM, not the author. The author's empathy is noted, and they didn't push for a solution that would add financial strain.\n\nSo, probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They tried to be considerate and didn't act unilaterally. The problem was a group decision, and the wife's reaction was more about the DM's approach rather than the author's.\n"
