We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group hosted at a couple's home, and after they had a baby, the baby is causing issues during game nights.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the baby is a distraction, loud, and even led to an ER visit once. The group felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. They didn't want to be the ones to bring up the issue, but eventually, one of the DMs did, and the wife reacted badly, saying she can't play ever again. The author feels bad because they wanted the wife to be included.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The group as a whole came to a consensus that the baby was a problem. They tried dealing with it for a while, but it's causing stress. The author didn't bring it up themselves, but they were part of the group that had this consensus. When the DM did bring it up, the wife was upset. \n\nThe author might think they're not in the wrong because they were part of a group that felt the baby was affecting their game. But maybe they should have handled it more sensitively? The wife was trying to join the games, and the author has empathy for her. The problem is that the baby's presence was making it hard for her to participate. \n\nBut the author didn't suggest alternatives like a babysitter, even though they know the husband lost his job. So maybe they should have approached the issue differently. However, the group as a whole agreed it was a problem, and the DM was the one to bring it up, not the author specifically. \n\nI think the key here is that the group made a collective decision and the DM addressed it. The author was part of that group but didn't act alone. The wife's reaction was severe, but the author's intention was to maintain the game's enjoyment. However, they might have contributed to the stress by being part of the group that raised the issue without considering the wife's feelings more. But since the DM was the one to actually bring it up, the author might not be directly at fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. They were part of a group that felt the baby was affecting their experience, and they tried to handle it without being the one to confront the couple. The wife's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's intent wasn't malicious. They might have handled it better, but they're not the one who initiated the conversation. So B makes sense.\n"
