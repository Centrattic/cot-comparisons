We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the described situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing issues during game nights. The author and others felt the baby was a distraction, leading to game disruptions, but they didn't want to come off as judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been hosting game nights for three years, going out of their way to make it work. A year ago, they had a baby, and the wife joined the game. The baby is mobile, loud, and sometimes causes interruptions. The group tried for a few months but eventually brought up the issue with the couple, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the group chats.\n\nThe author wasn't the one to bring it up initially, but they were part of the group that felt the baby was a problem. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's recent job loss. The author feels bad because they wanted the wife to be included.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate if the group's actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, the group is adults with limited time who use game nights to unwind. The baby's presence is disrupting their experience. It's reasonable for them to express concerns. However, they did try for a few months before addressing the issue, which shows they gave it time. The way the DM brought it up might have been poorly handled, leading to the wife's reaction. The author didn't directly confront the couple, which might have been the right choice, especially since they empathize with the wife's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the hosts have a right to their home and their child. The group's enjoyment is important, but so is the hosts' ability to manage their household. Maybe there were other solutions, like playing at a different time when the baby is asleep, or adjusting the game setup to minimize distractions. The author didn't suggest alternatives, which could have been a missed opportunity to find a compromise.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the group's decision to address the baby's impact was justified. Since the baby is causing significant disruptions, and the group collectively felt it affected their enjoyment, they have a valid reason to voice their concerns. However, the method of communication and the lack of alternatives might have contributed to the negative outcome. \n\nThe author's own feelings of guilt and empathy suggest they acted with good intentions. They weren't the one to bring up the issue directly, so their personal responsibility is minimal. The DM who raised the issue might share more responsibility for how it was communicated. The author's role was more about agreeing with the group's consensus, which is part of any collective activity where everyone's input matters.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they were part of a group that reasonably expressed concerns about a shared issue, albeit perhaps without enough consideration for alternative solutions. Their empathy and hesitation to assign blame further support that they acted in good faith.\n"
