We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the D&D group's situation is in the wrong. The author is part of a group that plays D&D weekly at the home of a married couple. The couple had a baby a year ago, and the baby is causing distractions during the game. The baby is mobile, loud, and even caused a trip to the ER once. The author mentions that the group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment, but when one of the DMs brought it up to the couple, the wife reacted badly and left the group chats.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong for helping to bring up the issue about the baby being a distraction? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group had been meeting for 3 years without any issues. The hosts are friends who go out of their way to accommodate the group. The baby's presence is causing interruptions during the games. The author notes that everyone in the group felt the baby was a problem, leading to stress instead of fun. The author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up since they aren't a DM, but when someone else did, the wife reacted strongly.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their game nights. If the baby is causing consistent disruptions, discussing the issue might be necessary. The author was trying to address a problem that affects everyone. However, approaching it in a way that makes the wife feel excluded is problematic. The wife is both a host and a player, and the issue might have made her feel like her new participation was being criticized, especially since she's the mother.\n\nThe author mentions feeling empathy for the wife's reaction and not wanting to make her feel excluded. They also considered suggesting a babysitter but felt it might be too expensive for the husband who lost his job. The author's intention was to solve the problem without adding financial burden, but the way the issue was raised might have been hurtful.\n\nIs the author wrong for being part of the group that brought up the issue? If the group collectively felt the baby was a problem, they might have a valid concern. However, the method of communication might have been flawed. The wife's reaction suggests that the conversation wasn't handled sensitively. The author's role in discussing the issue might be seen as necessary to maintain the group's dynamic, but the emotional impact on the wife is significant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have found a more tactful way to address the issue, perhaps considering the wife's new participation and the challenges of balancing parenthood with hobbies. The group could have offered support, like helping with babysitting, instead of just pointing out the problem. The author's concern about suggesting a babysitter due to the husband's job loss shows they tried to be considerate, but perhaps not enough.\n\nIn summary, the author's intentions were to improve the group's experience, but the approach might have been insensitive. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. If the group's enjoyment is important, then raising the issue isn't inherently wrong. However, the way it was handled caused hurt feelings, which could make the author partially at fault. But considering the group's collective feeling, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the problem was addressed in a respectful and supportive manner. Since the author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up and considered the couple's circumstances, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the outcome was hurtful, so perhaps they are.\n"
