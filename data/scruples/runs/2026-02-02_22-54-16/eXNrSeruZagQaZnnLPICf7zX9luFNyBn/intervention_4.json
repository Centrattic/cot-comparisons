We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing distractions. The author isn't the DM but was part of a group that discussed the problem with the hosts. The wife took it poorly, feeling excluded, and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The group plays D&D weekly, hosted by a married couple. The baby's presence leads to disruptions: noise, emergencies, and interruptions. The author mentions that everyone agreed it was affecting their enjoyment. The DM addressed the issue, but the wife reacted strongly.\n\nThe author's role here is more of a participant in the group discussion. They didn't take the lead but were part of the consensus. They feel empathy for the wife because she's a friend. They also mention not wanting to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the problem was a collective issue. The group as a whole decided it was affecting their experience. The author's participation in discussing the issue isn't inherently wrong. However, maybe they could have handled it more sensitively. But since the DM was the one to bring it up, the author's role is more about being part of a group decision. The wife's reaction is understandable, but the group has a right to their enjoyment. The author's empathy is noted, but they aren't the one who made the direct confrontation. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
