We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D game hosted by a couple, and the baby they have is causing disruptions. The author mentions that the baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction, leading to missed parts of the game, and even an ER visit. The group discussed the issue, and one of the DMs brought it up with the couple, but the wife took it badly, saying she can't play anymore and left the group chats.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty because they wanted the wife to stay involved as a friend. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter due to financial reasons. The key points here are whether the author is wrong for bringing up the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author actually brought up the issue. Wait, the author says they didn't bring it up because they weren't a DM. The DM did. The author is questioning if they are at fault for the outcome. The author felt the baby was affecting everyone's enjoyment, which is valid because the group's purpose is to unwind. However, the way the issue was communicated might have been a problem. The wife felt excluded, so maybe the approach taken by the DM or the group was too harsh or not empathetic enough.\n\nBut the author's role was to express the group's consensus. The author might have supported the DM's decision to bring up the issue. However, the author didn't directly confront the couple but was part of the group that discussed the problem. The question is whether the author is at fault. Since the author wasn't the one to bring it up, but was part of the group that felt it was necessary, there's a balance between group needs and individual circumstances.\n\nThe baby's presence is causing real issues, but the wife's reaction was extreme. The author might not be wrong for supporting the decision to address the problem, but maybe the handling was a bit rough. However, given that the group discussed it and the DM brought it up, the author's role is more passive here. The author's empathy for the wife's feelings is noted, which shows they care about her feelings, but they also had a right to enjoy the game. Considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were part of a group decision to address a legitimate issue that was affecting everyone's experience. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
