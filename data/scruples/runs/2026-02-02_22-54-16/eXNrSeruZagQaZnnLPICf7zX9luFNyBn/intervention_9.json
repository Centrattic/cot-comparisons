We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style story is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group that's been meeting for three years at a couple's house. The hosts had a baby, and now the baby is causing disturbances during game nights. The author didn't want to bring up the issue themselves because they're not the DM, but the DMs did, and the wife was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The hosts have been accommodating, providing space and snacks. The baby's presence is affecting the game experience\u2014mobile, loud, distractions leading to ER visits, and people missing the game. The group collectively felt it was an issue, so the DMs brought it up. The author is feeling guilty because the wife left the chats and seems upset. They don't want to suggest a babysitter due to financial concerns.\n\nThe key points here: The author is part of a group that's been affected, and they were included in the consensus. They didn't act alone and didn't push for the discussion. They care about the wife's feelings and the group's dynamics. The hosts had the baby, which is a significant life change, but the group's needs are also important. The wife's reaction seems extreme because she felt excluded from playing. However, the group might have valid reasons for wanting a distraction-free environment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't initiate the conversation but were part of the group that had the issue. Since the DMs were the ones to bring it up and the author expressed empathy, they probably aren't to blame. The main conflict is between the hosts' new responsibilities and the group's need for a good gaming experience. The author's intent was to address the problem to preserve the group's enjoyment, not to exclude the wife. The wife's reaction is more about her personal feelings of being excluded. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
