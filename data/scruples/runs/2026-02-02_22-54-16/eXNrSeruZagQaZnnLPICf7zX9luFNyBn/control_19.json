We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the D&D game situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: a group of adults plays D&D weekly at a couple's house. They had a baby a year ago, and the baby's presence is causing issues. The baby is mobile, loud, distracting, and once led to an ER visit. The wife started playing, which was exciting, but the baby's interruptions are making the game stressful. The group collectively felt it was affecting their enjoyment. The author didn't bring it up initially, but another DM did, and the wife was upset, withdrawing from the group.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they don't want to be the one to suggest this, especially since the wife is a friend. They also mention not wanting to ask for a babysitter due to financial concerns.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the baby is causing real disruptions, the group agreed it's a problem, but the way it was handled led to the wife feeling excluded. The author didn't directly bring it up but was part of the group that felt the issue needed addressing.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the problem isn't the author bringing it up, but maybe how it was handled. The author didn't bring it up themselves, but the group consensus was that the baby was an issue, and it was the DM who raised it. The wife's reaction was emotional, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is at fault. Since the author didn't directly bring it up, maybe they're not responsible. However, being part of the group that felt the baby was an issue and not trying to address it constructively might be a problem. But the author tried to avoid confrontation, which is human nature. The main issue was that the DM raised it in a way that hurt the wife, not the author. The author's intention was to maintain the game's enjoyment but also wanted to include the wife. The answer would be B, not in the wrong, because they were part of a group problem and didn't directly cause the conflict. The fault lies more with how the issue was communicated rather than the author's inaction.\n"
