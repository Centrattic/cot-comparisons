We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D game group that meets at a couple's house. The couple had a baby, and the baby is causing issues during their game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, causes interruptions, and even led to an ER visit once. The group eventually brought up the issue, but the wife was really upset and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the group's perspective. They all agreed that the baby was a problem affecting their enjoyment. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up because they didn't want to hurt the wife's feelings. But when the DM did bring it up, the wife took it really badly. The author feels bad because they care about the wife as a friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple is hosting the games, and the wife just started playing. The husband lost his job, so suggesting a babysitter might be too much financially. The author is empathizing with the wife's feelings but also wants the game to be enjoyable for everyone.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault for being part of the group that raised the issue. The author didn't directly confront the couple but was part of the consensus. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been hurtful. The wife felt excluded, which is a valid reaction. Maybe the group should have found a more supportive way to address the problem, like offering to help with childcare or adjusting the game times.\n\nBut the author didn't suggest any alternatives, just that the baby was an issue. The author also didn't want to suggest a babysitter because they know the couple's financial situation. So maybe the group didn't approach it sensitively enough. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a group decision and tried to avoid confrontation, but maybe they could have handled it better. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author had good intentions and the issue was a group consensus, but it's a tough call.\n"
