We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D situation is in the wrong. They provided the story where the hosts of their game had a baby, which started causing issues. The group consensus was the baby was a distraction, leading to stress and the wife quitting. The author didn't want to bring it up directly and felt bad about the outcome.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The hosts are friends, and the couple went out of their way to host. The baby's presence is affecting the game. The author didn't start the conversation but was part of the group consensus. The main issue is whether raising the issue of the baby was wrong.\n\nThe author's intent was to address the problem to maintain the group's enjoyment, which is understandable. Game nights are important for adults to unwind. The baby's behavior is causing disruptions, leading to safety concerns (ER visit) and missed game time. The wife felt excluded and left the group chats, which is a negative outcome.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? They didn't confront the couple directly but were part of the group that discussed the issue. The DM brought it up, so the author wasn't the one to do it. The author also considered the financial situation of the hosts and didn't suggest a babysitter. They felt empathy for the wife and were upset about her leaving.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the group has a right to enjoy their game, but the hosts have their own situation with a new baby. Maybe the discussion should have been handled more sensitively. However, the author didn't act unilaterally and was part of a group consensus. The problem is that the wife took it personally and left, which is a result of how the DM communicated it, not necessarily the author's fault.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were part of a group effort to address a shared problem, and they didn't ignore it. They also showed empathy and didn't make demands. The main issue is the communication by the DM, not the author's role in the group discussion. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
