We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions during game nights. The author mentions the baby is loud, a distraction, and even caused an emergency room visit. They wanted to address the issue but didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so eventually one of the DMs did, and the wife reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The group is made up of adults who use game nights to unwind. The hosts are making a big effort to accommodate everyone, but the baby is affecting the game's flow and enjoyment. The author isn't the DM, so they didn't initiate the conversation, but they were part of a consensus that the baby was a problem. The wife felt excluded and left the chats, which the author feels bad about.\n\nThe author argues they're not in the wrong because they were trying to address a shared concern. But others might say that bringing up the baby as an issue is insensitive, especially since the wife was just able to join the games. The hosts might feel that the group is turning against them. Also, the author considered suggesting a babysitter but felt it was too expensive given the husband's job loss.\n\nNow, considering social norms and empathy. It's important to balance the group's needs with the hosts' personal situation. The author wasn't the one to bring it up, but they agreed with the DM's decision. The wife's reaction shows she felt excluded, which adds to the complexity. The author's empathy for her feelings is a positive factor, but the problem still needs a solution without making the hosts feel blamed.\n\nPossible angles: The author isn't directly responsible for the conversation, but they supported the consensus. The issue is about differing priorities\u2014family vs. social activities. The hosts might need to find a way to manage the baby's presence, like a separate room for the baby or rescheduling when the baby isn't around. However, the group's enjoyment is also valid. The author's main point is that the baby is causing issues, which is a factual statement, but the way it's communicated can affect people's feelings.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person acted unreasonably. The author tried to address a problem that others shared. They didn't force the conversation, just supported the DM's actions. The wife's reaction is extreme, but the author's intent wasn't to exclude the wife. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they were part of a shared concern and acted with empathy.\n"
