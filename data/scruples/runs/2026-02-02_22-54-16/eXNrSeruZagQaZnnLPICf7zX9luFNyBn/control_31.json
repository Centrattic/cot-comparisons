We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the D&D game situation is in the wrong. The person told the hosts that their baby is an issue. The hosts are friends, and the baby is causing disruptions during game nights. The main points are that the baby is distracting, causing safety issues (like ending up in the ER), and making the games less enjoyable. The group discussed it, and one of the DMs brought it up to the couple. The wife was upset and left the group chats.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break this down. The author didn't start the conversation, but they were part of a group consensus that the baby was a problem. They felt bad about it because they wanted the wife to be included. The key points here are group dynamics and communication. \n\nFirst, the group had a problem that was affecting their enjoyment. Game nights are meant to be a way to unwind, and if the baby is making it stressful, that's a valid concern. However, the wife is a friend and part of the group now, and bringing up the issue caused her to feel excluded. The author didn't directly raise the issue themselves; it was the DMs who did. But the author was in agreement with the group's consensus. \n\nIs it wrong to express a problem that affects the group? Maybe not. The group has the right to discuss issues that impact their experience. But the way it was handled might be part of the problem. The wife might have felt attacked or blamed for the baby's behavior, which is out of her control. The author empathizes with her, which suggests they didn't mean to exclude her but were concerned about the group's experience.\n\nThe alternative is that the group might not have raised the issue if the author and others hadn't expressed their concerns. But the problem is that the author and the group didn't consider alternatives, like a babysitter, which they ruled out because of financial issues. The husband's job loss complicates things, but the author didn't suggest that, so maybe they tried to avoid causing more stress. \n\nSo, the author's intention was to address the group's issues, but the outcome was negative for the wife. The question is whether the group's collective decision to express the problem was wrong. Since the author was part of that consensus, they share some responsibility. However, the main issue might be how the problem was communicated rather than the problem itself. The answer could hinge on whether the group handled the conversation with sensitivity. The author isn't directly responsible for how the DMs approached the couple, but they were part of the group that discussed it. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the answer usually depends on whether the person crossed a line. Here, the author didn't act alone, so maybe they aren't the sole one at fault. The wife's reaction is also extreme, but that doesn't mean the group was in the right. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the author is not the one who brought up the issue, so they might not be in the wrong. The group's approach might have been the problem. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure. \n\nAnother angle: the author's empathy for the wife shows they didn't want to exclude her. They felt guilty after. So their intention wasn't malicious. The problem is that the group's discussion led to the wife feeling excluded, but the author was part of a group consensus. Since the question is about the author specifically, not the group as a whole, the answer might still be B. The author isn't the one who brought it up, just part of the group that discussed it. Therefore, they are not at fault.\n"
