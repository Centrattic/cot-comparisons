We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, causing interruptions, and leading to stress. They waited for someone else (the DM) to bring up the issue, but when it was finally addressed, the wife reacted strongly and left the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group has been meeting for three years, and the hosts have been very accommodating. The baby is a new variable that's affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author wasn't the one to bring up the issue directly but was part of the consensus that the baby was a problem. The wife took it personally, feeling excluded, even though the issue was about the baby's impact on the game.\n\nIs the author at fault for expressing a valid concern? They were trying to address a problem that affected the group's experience. However, the way the issue was communicated might have been a problem. The author didn't want to come off as dismissive of the wife's situation, especially with the husband's job loss. They also didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter, which could have been a helpful alternative.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. They expressed the group's collective concern, which led to the wife feeling excluded. However, the author's intention was to maintain the group's enjoyment, which is valid. The problem might lie more in how the DM approached the hosts rather than the author's role in voicing the issue. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of the problem's recognition and didn't act unilaterally. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
