We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault (AITA) for telling the hosts of their D&D game that their baby is an issue. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has been playing D&D for three years at a couple's home. The couple has a baby now, which is causing disruptions. The baby is mobile, loud, and leads to interruptions where the parents have to leave the game. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was a problem, but when one of the DMs brought it up, the wife reacted negatively, saying she can't play anymore and has distanced herself.\n\nThe author says they didn't want to be the one to bring it up because they weren't the DM, but others had the same issue. They feel bad for the wife since she's a friend and they wanted her to be included. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, why would the author be in the wrong? If the group collectively agreed the baby was an issue, maybe the author was just echoing the group's sentiment. But maybe the author shouldn't have contributed to the discussion, especially since it led to the wife leaving. Alternatively, the problem might be that the author didn't approach it sensitively or didn't consider alternative solutions like a babysitter, even though the husband's job situation is tough.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is part of a group that values their game nights as a way to unwind. The baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment. If the group as a whole felt it was an issue, the author was just part of that consensus. The problem arose when the DM brought it up directly to the couple, not necessarily the author. The author might feel guilty because they supported the group's sentiment, but perhaps they aren't the one who initiated the confrontation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's role was expressing the group's collective concern. However, maybe the author should have approached the matter more sensitively or suggested alternatives first. But given that the wife left and is upset, it's possible that the way the feedback was given could be improved, but the author might not be solely at fault. The main issue is that the group's enjoyment is being affected, which is a valid concern. However, the wife's emotional reaction complicates things. The author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is a bit nuanced. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author was part of a group that collectively felt the baby was an issue, and they didn't singlehandedly cause the problem. The main fault might lie with how the DM brought it up, not the author. Also, the author considered the wife's feelings and felt empathy, which shows they aren't callous. So, B seems more likely.\n"
