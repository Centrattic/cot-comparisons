We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby. The baby is causing distractions, leading to interruptions during game nights. The author mentions that everyone in the group agreed the baby was an issue, but when the DM brought it up, the wife was upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The hosts are friends, and they've been hosting for three years. The baby is a new addition, and the wife started playing around the same time. The baby's presence is causing problems: noise, safety concerns, and interruptions. The author didn't bring it up directly but acknowledges that others were also affected. When it was addressed by the DM, the wife had a strong negative reaction.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author didn't bring up the issue themselves, but they were aware of the consensus. The main question is whether they (or the group) acted inconsiderately. The author feels bad because the wife is upset and they wanted her to be included. Also, they don't want to suggest a babysitter due to financial constraints of the husband.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is part of a group that collectively felt the baby was an issue. The problem was brought up by the DM, not the author. The author's role seems to be more of a participant who was aware of the issues but didn't take the lead in addressing it. The wife's reaction was harsh, but the author doesn't seem to have directly caused that. However, the group's decision to discuss the baby's impact could be seen as insensitive if not handled carefully.\n\nBut the author is questioning their role here. They felt the baby was affecting everyone's enjoyment. It's a tough situation because it involves friends and a new parent. The group might have a right to express their concerns, but they should have done so with empathy, considering the parents' situation. However, the author didn't directly confront the hosts, so maybe they're not the one at fault.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group should have found a compromise first, like trying to adjust the game time or having another location when the baby is around. But the author mentions that they tried dealing with it for months before the DM brought it up. So perhaps the group had legitimate reasons to address it. The wife's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't necessarily make the group wrong for raising the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is part of a group that expressed a shared concern. While the approach might not have been perfect, the author itself didn't directly cause the problem. The main issue might lie with how the DM approached the wife, but the author isn't the one who brought it up. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
