We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game hosted by a couple. The couple had a baby, which started causing distractions during game nights. The author, along with others, felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. They tried to deal with it for a while, then a DM brought up the issue, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the group chats.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let me break this down. The author didn't directly bring up the issue but was part of the group consensus. The main points are that the baby is causing problems, the wife is upset, and the author feels bad about it. The author tried to be empathetic and didn't want to suggest a babysitter because of the husband's job loss. \n\nHmm. The key factors here are communication and empathy. The author and the group tried to handle it for a while, then a DM brought it up. The wife's reaction was strong. The author didn't initiate the conversation but was part of the consensus. But was it necessary to bring up the issue in the first place? \n\nOn one hand, the group's enjoyment is important, especially since they're busy adults using the game to unwind. If the baby is causing real disruptions (like ER visits, missed game parts), then it's a valid concern. On the other hand, the wife might feel excluded, especially since she's trying to balance being a parent and participating in the group. The author's empathy is noted, but maybe the approach wasn't handled sensitively enough.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't bring up the issue themselves. It was the DM who did. The author was part of the group that agreed it was an issue. So maybe the problem is more about how the DM communicated it rather than the author's role. The author might not be in the wrong because they tried to avoid confrontation and didn't directly express the issue to the couple. However, being part of the consensus that led to the DM bringing it up might still make them complicit.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. Since the author didn't directly confront the couple and expressed empathy, maybe they're not the asshole. The main issue here is about the group's communication with the hosts. The author might not be at fault if they tried to avoid being the one to bring it up and were concerned about the wife's feelings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group should have found a more supportive solution, like suggesting a babysitter (even if they didn't do it themselves) or adjusting the game times. But the author mentions the husband's job loss, so they might have felt it's not feasible. So the author's intention was good, but the outcome was negative. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, but the way the DM handled it was. The answer would be B (No).\n"
