We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions during game nights. The author is part of the group and mentioned that the baby is an issue, but didn't directly bring it up first. Instead, one of the DMs did, and the wife was really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group has been meeting for three years, hosted by a couple. The baby is mobile, loud, and causing interruptions. The author mentions that the group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. They tried dealing with it for a few months before the DM brought it up. \n\nThe author's main concern is that the wife is now upset and has distanced herself, and they feel bad about it. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter because the husband is unemployed. The author didn't start the conversation but was part of the group that acknowledged the problem.\n\nNow, the key points are: Did the author do something wrong? Well, they didn't directly confront the couple but were part of the group that discussed the issue. The problem was raised by the DM, not the author. The author expressed concern about the wife's feelings and tried to include her. However, the issue was a collective problem affecting everyone's enjoyment of the game. The author's empathy is clear, but they might have been part of the group that felt the need to address the situation.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? The group collectively agreed the baby was an issue. The DM brought it up, leading to the wife's reaction. The author didn't push for a babysitter but shared the group's consensus. Since they were part of the group that felt the baby was causing problems, maybe they're not entirely to blame. The main issue is how the problem was communicated, not the person who mentioned it. The wife's reaction is more about how the DM presented it, not necessarily the author. The author's empathy and not wanting to suggest a financial burden shows consideration. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B (Not in the wrong), because the author was part of a group that had valid concerns and didn't directly cause the conflict. The main fault might lie more with how the DM approached the couple, not the author. The author tried to be considerate and felt bad about the outcome. They were trying to address a problem that affected everyone, not just themselves. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
