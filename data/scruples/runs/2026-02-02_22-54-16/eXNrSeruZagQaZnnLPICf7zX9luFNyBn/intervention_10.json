We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for discussing the baby's impact on their D&D game with the hosts. The author is part of a group that plays weekly at a couple's home. The couple had a baby a year ago, and the baby is causing distractions. The author and others felt the baby was affecting their game experience, leading to stress and missed gameplay. The DM brought up the issue, and the wife was upset, feeling excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group is made up of busy adults who value their game nights as a way to unwind. The hosts are already accommodating by hosting and providing snacks. The baby's presence is causing disruptions\u2014emergency room visits, loud noises, interruptions. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue, not just them. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up but waited until the DM did.\n\nThe wife's reaction was strong, saying she can't play ever again. The author feels bad because they care about her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe key points: the group collectively agreed there was a problem, they communicated it through the DM, and the hosts were given the feedback. The author's intention wasn't to exclude the wife but to address a shared concern. However, the way the conversation went might have been handled poorly, leading to the wife feeling attacked. \n\nIs the author wrong for participating in bringing up the issue? Well, they were part of a group consensus. If the group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment, it's reasonable to address it. The problem is more about how the feedback was delivered rather than the existence of the concern itself. The author's empathy and the fact that they didn't want to suggest a babysitter (due to the husband's job loss) show consideration. \n\nBut maybe the author should have approached the hosts more sensitively before the DM did. However, since the group agreed and the DM took the lead, the author's role was part of a collective effort. The main issue is the wife's reaction, not necessarily the author's intent. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing a shared concern, but perhaps the group could have communicated the issue more delicately to avoid hurting the wife's feelings. The answer is B.\n"
