We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is about a D&D group that meets at the home of a married couple. The couple had a baby, and the baby is causing issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is loud, a distraction, and even caused an emergency room visit once. The group eventually brought it up to the couple, and the wife reacted negatively, removing herself from the chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group has been meeting for three years, and the couple has been hosting, so they've been integral to the setup. The baby is a new factor, and the group's enjoyment has been affected. The author says that everyone agreed the baby was a problem. But they didn't bring it up themselves, waiting for the DM to do so. The wife took it badly, feeling excluded from playing. The author feels bad because they wanted her to be part of the group.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author do something wrong? The author didn't bring up the issue directly but was part of the consensus that it was a problem. The DM did approach the couple. The author's intent wasn't to exclude the wife but to address the distraction. However, the way the issue was raised might have been handled poorly. The wife took it as a personal attack, maybe feeling that her presence as a player was being criticized. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a group that collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. But there's a balance between a group's needs and accommodating new circumstances. The couple might have felt they couldn't host anymore, especially with the husband's job loss. The author didn't suggest alternatives like a babysitter, which could have been a solution. However, they mentioned not wanting to suggest it due to financial reasons. So maybe the approach wasn't considerate enough. The answer might be B (No), because the group had a legitimate issue affecting their enjoyment, but the way it was communicated was problematic. The author isn't solely at fault, but the situation highlights communication issues. The wife's reaction also shows she felt marginalized. So the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe the group could have handled it better.\n"
