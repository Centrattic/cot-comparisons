We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the issue about the baby during their D&D game nights.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The couple hosts the game nights, and after having a baby, the baby is causing distractions. The author mentions that the baby is mobile, loud, and even caused an emergency room visit once. This is affecting the game because parents have to leave the table to take care of the baby, leading to missed storylines and delays. The group came to a consensus that the baby was an issue, so it wasn't just the author's opinion.\n\nThe author didn't want to be the one to bring it up as they have empathy for the wife, especially since the wife is a friend. They tried for a few months before one of the DMs finally addressed it. The wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded from the games now. The author is worried about her feelings and doesn't want to suggest a babysitter because they know the husband lost his job.\n\nSo, the author's main concern is whether they did the right thing. The key points here are: the issue was a group consensus, not just the author's complaint. The author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up, letting the DM handle it. The wife's reaction is understandable, but the problem was affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author's intention wasn't to exclude the wife but to address a real issue that was impacting the group's experience.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the DM brought it up, so the author isn't the one who initiated the conversation. The author is empathetic and feels bad about the wife's reaction. The problem existed, and the group collectively acknowledged it. So even though the wife is upset, the author isn't in the wrong for recognizing and addressing a legitimate problem that affects everyone's participation and enjoyment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
