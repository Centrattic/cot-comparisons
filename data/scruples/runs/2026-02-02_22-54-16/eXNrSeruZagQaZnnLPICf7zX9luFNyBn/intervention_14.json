We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up the issue of the baby during their D&D game nights. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group plays D&D weekly at a couple's house. They had a baby, and the baby is causing disruptions. The author mentions that the baby is loud, a distraction, and even led to an ER visit. The group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment, so they decided to talk to the couple. The DM brought it up, but the wife took it badly, saying she can't play anymore and has distanced herself. The author feels bad about this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the group had a consensus that the baby was an issue. The author didn't bring it up directly but was part of the group that decided to address it. The problem arose after the DM spoke to the couple, leading to the wife's anger. The author is questioning their role in this.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the group collectively decided the baby was a problem. It's common in group activities to address issues that affect everyone. The author was part of that consensus but didn't personally bring it up. They also showed empathy towards the wife's feelings. The wife's reaction was harsh, but the author didn't force the issue. Also, the author considered the couple's financial situation regarding a babysitter, which shows they tried to be considerate.\n\nHowever, maybe the approach could have been more sensitive. Maybe the group should have discussed it privately first or found solutions like a babysitter before deciding to stop the baby's presence. But the author didn't suggest a babysitter, which they thought would be too expensive. Still, the main point is that the group reached a decision, and the author felt the need to act because the situation was affecting everyone's enjoyment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were part of a group effort to address a shared problem. They also considered the couple's feelings and circumstances. The wife's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's intent was to improve the game nights for everyone. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
