We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is that the hosts of their game had a baby, which started causing issues during their game nights. The baby is loud, a distraction, and even caused an emergency room visit once. The author says that after some time, the DM brought up the issue, and the wife was really upset, leaving the group chats and not playing anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The author didn't directly confront the hosts but mentioned that the group collectively felt the baby was a problem. They also considered the financial situation of the hosts, not wanting to suggest a babysitter. The main points here are whether bringing up the issue was necessary and how it was handled.\n\nThe author's motivation seems to be about maintaining the group's enjoyment, as they're busy adults needing to unwind. But the wife took it personally, feeling excluded. The author is conflicted because they care about the wife as a friend. \n\nI think the key here is that the group did address the issue through the DM, which the author wasn't the one to bring up. However, maybe the approach could have been more sensitive. The author isn't the one who actually brought up the issue, so their responsibility might be less. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author wasn't the one to confront the hosts and was trying to balance everyone's needs, maybe they aren't at fault. However, the fact that the entire group came to a consensus might mean that even though the author didn't speak up, they were part of the group that felt this way. But the main person who acted was the DM. \n\nThe wife's reaction was extreme, and the author feels empathy. But the author isn't the one who directly caused the conflict. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to handle it through the DM, considered the hosts' situation, and didn't push for a solution that would be burdensome. The problem might lie more with how the DM approached it, not the author.\n"
