We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is part of a D&D group that meets weekly at a married couple's house. The couple became parents about a year ago, and the wife started joining the game. The baby is causing issues: being loud, distracting, and leading to interruptions. The group eventually discussed the problem with the couple, but the wife reacted angrily, feeling excluded now. The author feels bad and wonders if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main points are: the baby is disrupting the game, the group brought it up, the wife is upset, and the author is concerned about their role. The author mentions that the group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment, but they didn't want to suggest a babysitter due to financial concerns.\n\nNow, to analyze if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Group Consensus vs. Individual Feelings**: The group as a whole had agreed that the baby was an issue. However, bringing it up directly to the hosts might have been handled poorly. The author didn't take the initiative to talk to the hosts themselves, which might have been a better approach. If the author wasn't the DM, maybe they couldn't lead the conversation, but they could've still supported the DM in a more empathetic way.\n\n2. **Communication Approach**: The DM brought up the issue, but the wife felt attacked. The author didn't mention how the DM presented the problem. If the DM was harsh, that's on the DM. However, the author's concern for the wife's feelings shows they were trying to be considerate. But maybe the way the issue was raised overall wasn't framed correctly, focusing on the baby as the problem rather than finding solutions.\n\n3. **Empathy and Solutions**: The author shows empathy towards the wife and the couple's financial situation. Not suggesting a babysitter might be seen as not offering alternatives, but the author feels it's not feasible. However, maybe other solutions could have been considered, like adjusting game times or moving the location temporarily. The author might have contributed to the problem without offering viable solutions, which could make them feel like they're part of the issue.\n\n4. **Impact on the Hosts**: The hosts were accommodating by hosting the game. The baby's presence is now making it hard for the wife to participate. The author's group's enjoyment is being affected, but the hosts might feel they have their own challenges. The author's role here is part of a group that's causing stress to the hosts, which could make them complicit in the problem.\n\n5. **Personal Responsibility**: The author didn't take the lead in discussing the issue. While they didn't bring it up themselves, they did acknowledge the problem. It's possible that not addressing it sooner or not helping to find a solution could be seen as contributing to the problem.\n\nPutting it all together: The author isn't the one who brought up the issue, but they were part of a group that collectively decided it was a problem. The author's empathy and hesitation to suggest a babysitter show they care about the couple's situation. However, the way the issue was approached by the group (especially the DM) might not have been sensitive enough, leading to the wife's reaction. The author's role in supporting the DM's approach is part of the problem, but they aren't directly responsible for the way the issue was communicated. \n\nBut since the author was part of the group consensus and didn't take steps to mediate or offer alternatives, they might share some responsibility. However, the main fault lies with the DM for how the message was delivered. The author's intentions were good, and they were trying to address a genuine issue that was affecting everyone. So, overall, the author isn't in the wrong (B) because they were part of a group trying to solve a problem that was impacting their shared activity, even if the execution had issues.\n"
