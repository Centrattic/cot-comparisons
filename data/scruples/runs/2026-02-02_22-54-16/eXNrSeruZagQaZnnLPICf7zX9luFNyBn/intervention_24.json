We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group hosted at a couple's home. The hosts had a baby, which became a distraction during game nights. The group eventually brought up the issue, and the wife was upset, feeling excluded now.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author mentions that the baby was causing disruptions\u2014noise, needing attention, leading to missed parts of the game. They tried dealing with it for a few months before the DM brought it up. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, maybe out of empathy for the wife. The wife reacted strongly, feeling like she can't play anymore, which is upsetting the author because they are friends.\n\nThe author isn't the DM, so they deferred to the DM to bring up the issue. They also considered the financial situation of the hosts, not wanting to suggest a babysitter because the husband lost his job. The main conflict here is balancing the group's enjoyment of the game with the hosts' personal circumstances.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The group as a whole came to the consensus that the baby was a problem. The author didn't act alone; the DM brought it up. The author's intention was to address a problem that affected everyone's enjoyment. However, the way the issue was raised might have been handled poorly. The wife felt excluded, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a group that collectively felt the issue needed addressing. They tried to handle it with care, not wanting to be the one to bring it up. However, maybe they could have approached it differently, like discussing it privately with the couple first. But since the group as a whole reached a consensus, it's plausible that the problem was real and needed to be addressed. The author's empathy for the wife shows they considered her feelings, but the outcome was still hurtful.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances. The group's game nights are important for unwinding, and the baby's presence was causing stress. The author's role here was to voice a shared concern, which is necessary for maintaining group dynamics. However, the emotional impact on the wife is significant. But since the author wasn't the one who directly brought up the issue (the DM did), their personal responsibility might be lessened. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the issue was a shared concern, and the author acted with empathy, trying to address it without being confrontational. The fault might lie more in the group's approach to raising the issue rather than the author specifically. The author's intention was to maintain the group's enjoyment, which is a valid reason.\n"
