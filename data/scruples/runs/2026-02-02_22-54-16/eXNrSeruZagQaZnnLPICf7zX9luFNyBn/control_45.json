We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts had a baby, which started causing issues during game nights. The author is asking if they're at fault for pointing out the baby is a problem.\n\nFirst, the hosts were opening their home for the group, which was a big deal since most people don't have the space. The baby is causing distractions, leading to people missing parts of the game, and even a trip to the ER once. The author mentions that the group had a consensus that the baby was a problem, but when one of the DMs brought it up, the wife took it badly, and she's now upset and removed herself from the group.\n\nThe author's main points are that they wanted to address the issue but didn't want to be the one to bring it up, and they feel bad for the wife. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter because of the husband's financial situation.\n\nSo, the key factors here are: the group had a consensus that the baby was an issue. The author wasn't the one who raised it, but they were part of the group that agreed. However, when the DM did bring it up, the wife reacted strongly. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the issue was a group problem, and they were part of the consensus. However, maybe they could have handled it more sensitively. But since the DM was the one who actually brought it up, the author didn't have to be the one to do it. The wife's reaction might be more about how the issue was communicated rather than the issue itself. The author's empathy is there, but the problem was real and affecting everyone's enjoyment. So, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
