We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for telling the D&D hosts that their baby is causing issues. The situation is that the group plays D&D at the couple's house, and since they had a baby, the games have become disruptive. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, causes interruptions, and even led to an ER visit. They tried dealing with it for a few months before a DM brought it up, and the wife reacted strongly, leaving the group chats and being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group is there for relaxation and fun, but the baby is making it stressful. The author wasn't the one to bring it up first, but others did. The key points are that the issue was a group consensus, not just the author's personal problem. The author also shows empathy towards the wife's feelings, which suggests they had good intentions.\n\nThe hosts are providing a space for the group, so there's a balance between their needs and the group's. The baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment. However, the way the issue was raised might have been handled differently. The wife's strong reaction indicates that the communication might have been harsh or not considered her feelings enough. But the author didn't start the conversation, so they might share some responsibility in how the issue was addressed.\n\nThe author's main point is that the group collectively felt the baby was an issue. They also mention not wanting to suggest a babysitter due to financial constraints. The author's intention was to maintain the group's fun and include the wife, but the outcome was negative. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who initiated the discussion, but they might have contributed by agreeing to the consensus. However, the main blame falls on the DM who brought it up and the wife's reaction. The author's empathy shows they aren't malicious, so it's possible they're not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the issue was a group problem, and the author was part of the consensus. They acted in the interest of the group's enjoyment and showed empathy. The main issue might be how the DM handled the discussion, not the author's involvement in the consensus.\n"
