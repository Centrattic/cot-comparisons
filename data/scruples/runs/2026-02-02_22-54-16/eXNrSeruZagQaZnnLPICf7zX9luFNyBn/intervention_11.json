We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the setup: They're part of a group that plays D&D weekly at a couple's house for three years. The hosts are friends, and they've been accommodating. When the couple had a baby, it started causing issues. The baby is distracting, causes interruptions, and even led to an ER visit once. The author and others felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. They all agreed it was a problem, but the DM brought it up to the couple. The wife reacted badly, saying she can't play anymore, and stopped communicating. The author feels bad because they value the friendship and didn't want to exclude her. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter because the husband lost his job.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks the author isn't wrong. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author didn't bring up the issue directly; they let the DM handle it. However, the problem was that the baby was causing real disruptions. The group's consensus was that it was a problem. The wife's reaction was extreme, but the author's intention was to maintain their enjoyment of the game. But maybe the approach could have been better. However, the author did express empathy and tried to handle it through the DM, which is a reasonable step. They also considered the couple's financial situation. \n\nIs it wrong to address a problem that's affecting everyone's experience? Probably not. The key here is whether the author acted inconsiderately. Since they tried to handle it through the DM and with the group's consensus, it seems they were trying to be respectful. The wife's reaction might be more about how the issue was communicated rather than the issue itself. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for better communication next time. So the answer would be B.\n"
