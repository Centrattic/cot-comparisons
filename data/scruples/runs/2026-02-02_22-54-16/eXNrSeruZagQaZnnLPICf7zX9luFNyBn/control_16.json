We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the D&D group situation is in the wrong. The author is part of a group that plays D&D every week at the hosts' home. After the hosts had a baby, the baby became a distraction, causing interruptions and stress. The author didn't want to bring it up initially, but eventually, someone did, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the group. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are friends who go out of their way to host the games. The baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author and others felt the game nights were supposed to be their relaxation time, so the baby's disruptions were causing more stress. However, the author didn't bring up the issue themselves, letting a DM do it instead. The wife's reaction was strong, feeling excluded, which the author empathizes with.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did express a collective concern that was shared by the group. The problem was that the baby was causing real issues\u2014interruptions, missed parts of the game, even an ER visit. They tried to handle it respectfully by not being the one to bring it up and considering the financial situation of the hosts. The author also mentions empathy for the wife's feelings.\n\nBut maybe they should have approached the situation differently. Perhaps they should have talked to the hosts privately first, as a group, to address the issue before it escalated. The fact that they didn't want to be the one to bring it up might mean they shifted responsibility to the DM, which might not have been the best approach. However, the author wasn't the one who raised it; it was the DM. The author shares in the collective decision but may not be personally at fault. The main issue is that the hosts' situation changed (a baby), which affects everyone, but the group's needs also matter. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were part of a group that had a legitimate issue that needed addressing. They tried to handle it with care, avoiding making the hosts feel blamed. The wife's reaction is more about how the issue was communicated rather than the issue itself. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
