We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is at fault for bringing up the issue of the baby affecting their D&D game.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has been playing D&D for three years at the hosts' home. The hosts have a baby now, which is causing disruptions during the games. The baby is mobile, loud, and even led to an ER visit once. The wife, who started playing after the baby, is struggling because she has to leave the game to take care of the baby. The group decided the baby was an issue, so one of the DMs brought it up to the couple. The wife got upset, pulled out of the group chats, and is still upset. The author is feeling bad about this and wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nThe author isn't the DM, so they didn't bring it up themselves. However, the group consensus was that the baby was a problem. The author mentions they empathize with the wife and feel bad because they wanted her included.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the group collectively decided the baby was an issue, someone (a DM) brought it up, and the wife reacted negatively. The author is part of the group but didn't directly confront the hosts. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had a responsibility to handle the issue differently. Since the author didn't bring it up directly, maybe they're not at fault. But maybe they should have handled it more sensitively. However, the main action here was done by the DM, not the author. The author is just part of the group that agreed there was a problem. The wife's reaction seems to be directed at the DM or the group as a whole, not specifically the author.\n\nAlso, the author is not suggesting they should pay for a babysitter, which is considerate given the husband's job loss. They're empathetic. The problem is that the wife is upset and excluded now. But the group's intention was to have a fun game night. The author is in a group that collectively made the decision, so the blame isn't solely on them.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they participated in the group decision and didn't take direct action. The main issue was handled by the DM, and the author is feeling guilty as a group member. So the answer is B (No).\n"
