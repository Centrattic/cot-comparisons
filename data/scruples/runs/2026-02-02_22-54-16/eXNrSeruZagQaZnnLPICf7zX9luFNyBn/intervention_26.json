We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a group that plays D&D at a couple's house every week. The hosts had a baby, which is causing issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, making the games less enjoyable, and even leading to an ER trip. They tried dealing with it for a few months but eventually, a DM brought it up to the couple, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the group.\n\nThe author is not the DM, so they didn't bring it up themselves. They feel bad about the wife's reaction and empathize with her, but also want the games to be fun for everyone. They also mention not wanting to suggest a babysitter because the husband lost his job.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). From my perspective, the author is in a tough spot. They didn't bring up the issue directly, but they were part of a group consensus that the baby was affecting the game. The main issue here is communication. The DM did bring it up, but the way it was handled might have been harsh. The author, as a participant, had valid concerns about their enjoyment and the safety of the games. However, they did express empathy and tried not to take sides. They didn't force the issue but were part of a group that had a collective problem.\n\nThe wife's reaction is understandable because she's a new parent and might feel defensive. The author didn't confront the couple directly but was part of a group that eventually did. Since they're not the one who brought it up, maybe they're not fully at fault. But in a group setting, if the majority is unhappy, the hosts have responsibilities too. The hosts might need to consider alternative arrangements. However, the author did try to be considerate and not add financial burden on the couple. \n\nSo, in my opinion, the author isn't in the wrong. They voiced concerns in a group where it was a consensus, didn't bring it up personally, and tried to be empathetic. The main fault might lie in how the DM presented the issue to the couple, not the author. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
