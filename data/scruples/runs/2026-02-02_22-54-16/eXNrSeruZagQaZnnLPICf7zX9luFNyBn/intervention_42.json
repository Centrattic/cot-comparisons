We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing issues during game nights. The author is part of the group and mentions that the baby is a distraction, leading to interruptions and stress. They didn't bring up the issue themselves but other group members did, and now the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The hosts have been accommodating the group for three years. After the baby was born, the baby's presence started affecting the game. The author and others felt it was impacting their enjoyment. The DM eventually addressed it, and the wife reacted negatively, withdrawing from the group.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if bringing up the issue to the hosts was necessary or if it was handled appropriately. The author didn't mention that they wanted to exclude the baby or the wife's participation. Instead, they wanted to maintain the game's quality. However, they were hesitant to start the conversation, which was taken up by the DM.\n\nAnother angle is whether the group should have addressed the issue collectively. The author might feel guilty because the wife took it harshly, but the group had already consensus that the baby was a problem. The author also considered not suggesting a babysitter due to the husband's unemployment, showing consideration for their situation.\n\nI should check for any potential oversights. Did the group try to find a compromise first? Maybe they could have suggested a babysitter once in a while or adjusted game times. However, the author states they tried dealing with it for months before the issue was addressed. Also, the wife's reaction seems extreme, but the author empathizes with her feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent was to maintain the group's enjoyment, and they didn't act alone. The problem was brought up by the DM, so the author isn't solely responsible. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) as the author's actions were part of addressing a collective issue and not malicious.\n"
