We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for talking to the hosts about their baby being a problem during their D&D game nights. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple hosts the game nights, which are important for the group's social time. After the birth of their baby, the child's behavior started causing issues\u2014being loud, distracting, even leading to an ER visit once. The group tried to handle it for a few months, but eventually, someone (a DM) brought it up. The wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded.\n\nThe author mentions that they didn't bring it up first because they didn't want to be the one to cause conflict and that they empathize with the wife. The key points here are that the group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment, and the issue was discussed by the DMs, not the author directly. The author also shows empathy for the wife's feelings, indicating they didn't want to exclude her.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. If the author was part of the group that decided the baby was an issue and supported bringing it up, but didn't directly confront the hosts, maybe they share some responsibility. However, since the actual conversation was led by the DMs, the author might not be the one at fault. The problem is that the wife felt her participation was invalidated. The author's empathy suggests they didn't mean to harm, and they might have supported the decision to address the issue for everyone's enjoyment.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't directly bring up the issue, but was part of the group that felt it was a problem, maybe they aren't the one to blame. The main fault might lie with the DMs who initiated the conversation, but the author's role is being questioned. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, so I should check if that's the case.\n\nAnother angle: the group's right to enjoy their game nights versus the hosts' situation with a new baby. The hosts are already struggling financially, and suggesting a babysitter isn't feasible. The author didn't push for that, so maybe they handled it correctly. The author's empathy and not wanting to exclude the wife is positive. The issue is that the wife felt excluded, but the group's collective decision might have been necessary for their own well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't the one who brought up the issue, but they were part of the group that felt it was a problem. They showed empathy and didn't want to make the wife feel excluded. So the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
