We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling the hosts of their D&D game that their baby is an issue. The situation is that the hosts have a baby now, which is causing disruptions during game nights. The baby is mobile, loud, and even caused an ER visit once. The group had to deal with interruptions, and eventually one of the DMs brought up the issue, leading to the wife being really upset and leaving the group chats.\n\nThe user is asking if they did the wrong thing. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Let me break down the key points. \n\nFirst, the group plays D&D weekly at the hosts' home for three years. The hosts go out of their way to set up the space and provide snacks, so they've been very accommodating. The baby came into the picture a year ago, and the wife started playing. The baby's presence is causing problems: it's distracting, leading to interruptions, and causing stress. The group consensus is that the baby is an issue affecting their enjoyment. However, when the issue was raised, the wife reacted negatively, feeling excluded and the author is empathetic towards her.\n\nThe author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, but the DM did. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong. \n\nSo, the question is whether the group was justified in addressing the baby's impact on their game nights. On one hand, they're adults using game nights to unwind. The baby's presence is making it hard to enjoy. On the other hand, the hosts are doing their best, and the wife being a friend is now excluded because of the issue. \n\nThe author argues that the baby is a distraction, and the group tried to deal with it for months. They didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter because they know the financial situation. But is it fair to tell the hosts that the baby is an issue? \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, maybe the problem is how the issue was approached. The DM brought it up, and the wife was hurt. But the group had a consensus, so maybe it's a valid concern. The author's empathy for the wife's feelings suggests they didn't want to cause conflict, but the baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe suggesting solutions like a babysitter if possible, but the author considered that the husband lost his job, so it's not feasible. They could have tried to adjust the game to accommodate the baby, but the baby is a child, and the group is there for adults. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the group is within their rights to address issues that affect their experience. But the way it was communicated might have been a problem. However, the author didn't bring it up directly. The DM did, and the author supported the consensus. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a legitimate issue that's affecting their group's ability to enjoy the game. The problem might be more about how it was handled, but the author's intention wasn't malicious. They tried to be considerate and didn't push for a solution that's financially burdensome. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
