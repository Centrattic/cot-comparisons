We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group that used to meet at the home of a married couple. After the couple had a baby, the baby became a distraction during game nights. The author, along with others, felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment, so they eventually brought it up to the couple. The wife reacted negatively, leaving the group chats and seeming upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts put a lot of effort into hosting the games, and the group appreciates it. The baby's presence is causing practical issues\u2014noise, the need for someone to leave the game to care for the baby, and even an ER visit once. The author wasn't the one to raise the issue directly but was part of the consensus that led to it. The main question is whether the author (and the group) were wrong to express their concerns.\n\nThe wife felt excluded, which is understandable, especially since she's a friend and wanted to participate. The author has empathy for her feelings. However, the group's game nights are their time to unwind, and the baby is making it stressful. The husband's job situation adds another layer\u2014suggesting a babysitter might not be feasible financially.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to handle it by not being the one to bring it up, but when someone else did, the wife was hurt. The problem isn't the author directly confronting them but being part of the group that had the issue. It's possible that the way the issue was raised could have been more sensitive. Maybe there was a way to address the problem without making the wife feel excluded. However, the group's right to enjoy their game nights shouldn't be dismissed either. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the impact on everyone's experience.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the balance is often between different people's needs and how they communicate. The author's intention wasn't to exclude the wife but to address a real problem. However, the outcome was hurt feelings. It's a tough spot. The answer might hinge on whether the group's concerns were valid and if there were alternative solutions considered. Since the author didn't outright suggest the wife stop playing and was empathetic, maybe they're not in the wrong. But also, perhaps there was a more diplomatic way to handle it. I think the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because they were trying to address a real issue affecting the group, even if the communication wasn't perfect. The main fault might lie in how the DM brought it up, not the author specifically.\n"
