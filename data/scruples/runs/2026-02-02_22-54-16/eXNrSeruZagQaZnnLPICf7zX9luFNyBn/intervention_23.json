We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions. The author says that the baby is a distraction, causing missed parts of the game, stress, and even a trip to the ER. They mention that the group collectively agreed it was an issue, but when the DM brought it up, the wife got upset and left. The author feels bad but also wants game nights to be enjoyable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are friends, and they've been hosting for a long time. The baby is new, and the group is adjusting. The key points are that the baby is causing real problems\u2014distractions, people missing game parts, stress. The author didn't bring it up directly but was part of the group that acknowledged the issue. Then the DM did bring it up, leading to the wife's reaction.\n\nThe author's main concern is whether they're at fault. The user thinks the author isn't, but I need to evaluate. The author didn't confront the couple directly but was part of a consensus. The problem is that the wife felt excluded and took the criticism personally. Maybe the way the issue was communicated was harsh or not considered enough of her perspective. However, the author didn't do the confronting, so perhaps they're less to blame than the DM. \n\nAnother angle: Was the group being considerate enough about the hosts' situation? The husband just lost his job, so suggesting a babysitter might be insensitive. The author recognized this and didn't push it, which shows empathy. But the group still felt the need to address the baby's impact on their game night. It's a balance between respecting the hosts' situation and the group's need to enjoy their time. \n\nThe author's empathy is clear\u2014they feel bad for the wife and want her to feel included. The fact that they didn't take the lead in bringing it up suggests they tried to avoid conflict. The main issue might be how the DM approached the couple, not the group's consensus. Since the author was part of the group that agreed on the issue but didn't directly confront the hosts, they might not be in the wrong. However, maybe they could have handled it more sensitively, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer seems to lean towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They expressed concerns, but the actual confrontation was done by the DM. The author's intentions were to maintain the game's quality and friend's inclusion, but the fallout was due to how the DM handled it. The author tried to be empathetic and didn't push for solutions that would add financial strain. So, they're not at fault here.\n"
