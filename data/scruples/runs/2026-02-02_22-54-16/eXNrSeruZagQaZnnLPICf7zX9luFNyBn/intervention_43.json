We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game hosted at a couple's home, and the baby they have is causing disruptions. The author mentions that the baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction, leading to missed parts of the game and stress. The group eventually brings it up, but the wife reacts negatively, feeling excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The hosts have been hosting for three years, and the baby is a significant change. The group is made of busy adults who play to unwind. The baby's presence is affecting their ability to enjoy the game. The author didn't bring up the issue themselves but acknowledges that others did. The wife's reaction was strong, but the author feels empathetic towards her. They also consider that suggesting a babysitter might be insensitive given the husband's job loss.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the group as a whole came to the consensus that the baby was a problem. The author didn't escalate it but mentioned it as part of the group's concerns. The main issue is whether it was wrong to point out the baby as a problem. Since the group collectively felt it was affecting their experience, it might be reasonable. However, the way the issue was brought up could matter. But the author didn't bring it up directly; the DM did. The author's empathy suggests they handled it with care.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have considered alternative solutions before expressing the problem. But the story says that after trying to deal with it for months, they had no choice. The hosts had rearranged their home for the group, so it's not like they're not accommodating. The baby is a valid concern in a setting that requires attention. The wife's reaction is emotional, but it's possible the group's approach was hurtful. However, the group's intent was to address a real issue affecting their shared activity. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the problem was real and the group addressed it collectively. The author's empathy shows they care about the friends' feelings but didn't act maliciously. The answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the issue was valid and addressed in a group context, not as a personal attack.\n"
