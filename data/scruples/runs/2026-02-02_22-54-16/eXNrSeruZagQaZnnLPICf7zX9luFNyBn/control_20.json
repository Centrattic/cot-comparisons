We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D group situation is in the wrong. The main issue is that the hosts of their game nights have a baby that's causing disruptions. The author says the baby is loud, a distraction, and even caused some ER visits. They mention that the group as a whole agreed the baby was a problem, but when one of the DMs brought it up, the wife took it badly and left the group chats. The author is feeling guilty because they wanted the wife to be included but also wanted the game to be enjoyable. They're worried they might be at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't bring up the issue directly; it was the DM. The group consensus was that the baby was causing issues. The problem here is that the baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author is empathetic towards the wife, who is also a friend, and they don't want to suggest a babysitter because the husband just lost his job. \n\nIs the author responsible for bringing up the issue? They didn't, but they might have contributed to the group consensus. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing that the baby is an issue. The group agreed, so it's a collective decision. The author's main action is being part of the group that agreed and allowing the issue to be raised by the DM. The wife's reaction is more about the DM bringing it up, not the author. \n\nThe author's guilt comes from feeling bad about the wife's exclusion, but the problem was that the baby made it impossible for her to participate. The author isn't pushing for the wife to leave; they're just acknowledging the problem. The key here is that the author isn't directly responsible for the conflict. They expressed concerns within the group, which led to a discussion, but the actual confrontation was handled by the DM. The author's empathy is noted, so they aren't malicious. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is a real disruption, and the group discussed it collectively. The author's role was to voice their experience, which is valid. The wife's reaction is more about the DM's approach rather than the author's. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
