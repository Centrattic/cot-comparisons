We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a D&D group that plays at a couple's house. After the couple has a baby, the baby becomes disruptive during game nights. The author, along with others, feels the baby is causing issues\u2014distractions, missed parts of the game, ER visits due to the baby getting into things. They didn't address it directly until a DM brought it up, and the wife reacted negatively, pulling away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The hosts are providing a space for the group, which is a big deal. The baby's presence is affecting the game experience. But the author didn't bring up the issue themselves and waited for the DM to do it. The wife's reaction was strong, feeling excluded. The author is concerned about the wife's feelings since they're friends.\n\nNow, the key points are: Did the author do something wrong by being part of the group that pointed out the baby as a problem? The author didn't directly confront the couple but was part of the consensus. The hosts have their own challenges, like the husband's job loss. The author also feels bad about not suggesting a babysitter due to financial constraints.\n\nThe author's actions are about expressing a legitimate concern about the impact on their social activity. But the way the issue was raised might have been insensitive, even if it wasn't the author who brought it up. The wife's reaction suggests she felt her participation was being invalidated. The author's empathy is noted, but the problem exists. It's a balance between respecting social gatherings and acknowledging the new realities of the hosts.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's common for the person to face criticism if their actions, even well-intentioned, hurt others. However, if the issue is a shared consensus and the author isn't the one who approached the couple, maybe their responsibility is less. But being part of the group that voiced the problem could still make them partially responsible. The answer hinges on whether the problem was valid and how it was communicated. Since the DM raised it, not the author, but the author agreed with the sentiment, the blame isn't solely on them. However, the wife's exclusion is a key point. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for understanding both sides. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they had valid concerns and didn't act alone, but there's a nuance here. Alternatively, maybe the author should have handled it more sensitively. Hmm.\n"
