We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions. The author and others think the baby is an issue, and they brought it up. The wife got really upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group has been meeting for three years, and the hosts are providing their space. When the baby came, it started causing problems: being loud, needing attention, even an ER visit. The group tried to handle it, but it was affecting their enjoyment. The DMs talked to the hosts, and the wife was hurt, feeling like she can't play anymore. The author feels bad because they wanted her to be included.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? They didn't bring it up directly but were part of the consensus. The main question is whether it's wrong to point out a problem that affects everyone. Game nights are important for them as adults. On the other hand, the wife is a friend and wanted to participate. The author didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter, maybe because they know the couple's financial situation.\n\nThe author's intentions were good\u2014they wanted to include the wife but also the group's enjoyment. However, bringing up the issue in a group setting might have been harsh. Maybe they should have approached it more sensitively. But since the DMs were the ones who actually brought it up, the author might just be part of the collective concern. The wife's reaction suggests that the way it was communicated was hurtful. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a collective decision, but maybe they could have handled it differently. However, the answer depends on whether the problem was valid. Since the baby was causing actual disruptions, the group's feedback is understandable. The author isn't to blame for wanting the group to function well. So probably not in the wrong.\n"
