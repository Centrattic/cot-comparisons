We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D situation is in the wrong. The author is part of a D&D group that's been meeting at a couple's house for three years. After the couple had a baby, the baby started causing issues during game nights\u2014being loud, distracting, even leading to an ER visit once. The group eventually brought it up, but the wife took it badly, left the chats, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are friends, and they've been accommodating the group by opening their home. The baby is a new variable that's affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author mentions that the group collectively realized the baby was an issue, not just them. So the problem wasn't just one person's opinion but a shared concern among the group. \n\nThe author didn't want to be the one to bring it up because they're not the DM, so they let the DM handle it. However, the way the wife reacted suggests that the conversation wasn't handled well. The author is empathetic and feels guilty, especially since the wife is a friend. They also consider the financial situation of the hosts, understanding that a babysitter might not be feasible.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Was the author wrong for bringing up the issue? Or was it a necessary step for everyone's enjoyment? The group consensus seems to support the author's concerns. If the baby is causing regular disruptions, it's reasonable to address it. The problem might be more about how the issue was communicated rather than the issue itself. The wife's reaction indicates she felt excluded or criticized, which might have been avoidable with a more sensitive approach.\n\nBut the author didn't bring it up directly; they waited for the DM to do so. The author's intentions were to maintain the group's fun and include their friend. The main conflict is between the group's need for a distraction-free game night and the hosts' situation with a newborn. The author isn't at fault for pointing out a real problem that affects everyone. However, the way the issue was raised might have been harsh, leading to the wife's upset. But since the author didn't initiate the conversation and felt empathy, it's more about the DM's handling than the author's.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They were part of a group effort to address a valid issue, and their empathy shows they weren't malicious. The problem is more about the communication style rather than the content of the concern.\n"
