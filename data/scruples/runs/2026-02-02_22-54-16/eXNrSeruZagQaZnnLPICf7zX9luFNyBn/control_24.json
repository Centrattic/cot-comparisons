We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the D&D game situation is in the wrong. The author of the question is part of a group that plays D&D weekly at a couple's house. The couple had a baby, and the baby is causing problems during the game. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, causes the parents to leave the game, and even led to an ER visit once. They say that everyone in the group agreed the baby was an issue, so they brought it up to the couple. The wife took it badly, feeling excluded, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The author wasn't the one to initiate the conversation; it was one of the DMs. The author did express empathy towards the wife and didn't want to suggest a babysitter because they know the husband lost his job. The main question is whether bringing up the issue was wrong. \n\nIn group activities like this, communication is key. The group's enjoyment is being affected, and they tried to address it. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been handled poorly. The wife's reaction suggests that the conversation wasn't sensitive enough. The author didn't take the lead, so maybe they're not at fault. But the group as a whole might have been abrupt in their approach without considering the parents' situation. \n\nThe author's actions were to be part of a group that eventually communicated the problem, not to create it. The real issue might be how the DM handled the conversation rather than the author. The author expressed empathy and tried to avoid making it worse by not suggesting a babysitter. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the group's approach could have been better. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
