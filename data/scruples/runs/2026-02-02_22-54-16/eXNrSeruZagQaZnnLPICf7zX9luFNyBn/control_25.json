We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe scenario is about a group of adults who play D&D weekly at a couple's house. The couple had a baby, which has become a distraction during game nights. The baby is loud, causing interruptions, and leading to stress. The group eventually brings up the issue, but the wife reacts strongly, feeling excluded, and the author is questioning their role in this.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the group collectively came to the consensus that the baby was an issue. So it wasn't just one person's opinion. The author didn't bring it up initially because they weren't the DM, but when the DM did, the wife was upset. The author feels bad because they value the wife as a friend and didn't want her to feel excluded.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Did the group address the issue in a respectful and considerate way? The author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up, which shows they were sensitive to the hosts' feelings. The problem was that the baby's presence was affecting everyone's experience. The wife's reaction was extreme, leading her to leave the group chats. The author is empathetic but feels guilty about the outcome.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The group did express their concerns as a collective, and the author wasn't the one who initiated the conversation. The author's intention was to improve their shared game nights, which is a valid concern. However, the way the issue was raised might have been harsh, but the author wasn't the one to bring it up. The wife's reaction is also a factor here; maybe the way the problem was communicated was not sensitive enough.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the group's approach was respectful and whether the author had a responsibility to handle it differently. Since the author deferred to the DM to bring up the issue, and the problem was a collective decision, the author is not in the wrong. The main issue might be in how the DM communicated the problem, not the author themselves. So the answer is B (No).\n"
