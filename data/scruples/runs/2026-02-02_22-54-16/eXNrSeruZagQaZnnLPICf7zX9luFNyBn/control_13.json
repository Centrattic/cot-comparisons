We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told the D&D hosts that their baby is an issue is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The group plays D&D weekly at the couple's home. The couple became parents, and the baby is causing disruptions. The main issues are the baby's noise, the parents having to leave the game to attend to the baby, and past incidents like the ER visit. The author mentions that the group consensus was that the baby was affecting their enjoyment. The DM finally brought it up, leading to the wife being upset and pulling back.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. The key points to consider are: Did the group address the issue collectively? The author didn't bring it up themselves but waited for the DM. The wife took it personally and felt excluded. The author empathizes with her feelings. The author also considered the couple's financial situation regarding a babysitter.\n\nThe author's main question is whether they did something wrong. The answer hinges on whether the group's concerns were communicated properly and respectfully. Since the DM raised it, not the author, and the author expressed empathy, it's more about the group's approach rather than the author's direct actions. The wife's reaction might be due to feeling criticized as a parent, not necessarily the author's fault. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
