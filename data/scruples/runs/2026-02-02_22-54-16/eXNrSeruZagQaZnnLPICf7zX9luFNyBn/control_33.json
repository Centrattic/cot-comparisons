We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the D&D situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple hosting a weekly game, and after having a baby, the baby is causing distractions and stress. The author didn't want to be the one to mention the issue but others agreed, and eventually, one of the DMs brought it up. The wife got upset and stopped participating. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The author didn't bring up the issue themselves but others did. The key points here are the baby's impact on the game, the wife's reaction, and the author's intentions. They mention that the baby is mobile, loud, and has caused an ER visit. The game is stressful and less fun because of it. The group came to a consensus it was a problem, but the author didn't raise it directly. \n\nThe wife's reaction was strong, feeling like she can't play anymore. The author feels empathetic towards her. Now, was the author wrong for not bringing it up themselves? Well, the author is not the DM, so maybe they felt less authority. But the group already agreed on the problem, so the author's role in that consensus might mean they weren't the one at fault. The main issue was the group's collective discomfort, but the DM raised it. The author might not be in the wrong for not being the one to bring it up, especially since they wanted to include the wife as a friend. \n\nHowever, the question is if the author is in the wrong for telling the hosts their baby is an issue. But the author says they didn't bring it up. The problem was that it was brought up by someone else, leading to the wife's upset. The author might have been part of the consensus but didn't act, so maybe they should have communicated it more delicately. But since they didn't actually say anything, maybe they aren't at fault. The main issue here is the group's decision to mention the problem, which was necessary for their enjoyment. The author's empathy towards the wife is noted, but the group had to address the distraction. So, likely the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they were part of a group that needed to address the impact on their shared activity, and the DM was the one to bring it up.\n"
