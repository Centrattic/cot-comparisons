We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D situation is in the wrong. The author is part of a D&D group that meets at a couple's house. After the couple had a baby, the baby started causing issues during game nights\u2014being noisy, distracting, and leading to interruptions. The author and others felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. They tried to handle it but eventually, a DM brought it up with the couple. The wife took it badly and left the group chats.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty, especially because the wife is their friend. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up and don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss. Now they're asking if they're the a**hole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The main points are:\n\n1. The hosts opened their home for the group for three years, which is a big deal. Then the baby comes, and there are issues.\n2. The baby's behavior affects the game\u2014interruptions, noise, etc. The group consensus is it's a problem.\n3. The author didn't bring up the issue but the DM did. The wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded, and left the group.\n4. The author is empathetic and feels bad, trying to balance between the group's needs and the couple's situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't directly bring it up. The issue was a consensus, and someone else did the talking. But maybe the author should have handled it differently? Like approaching the couple privately before it escalated?\n\nBut the author didn't want to be the one to bring it up because they didn't want to hurt the wife's feelings. Maybe that's understandable. However, not addressing the problem until it's escalated might have contributed to the situation. Also, the group's enjoyment is important, but so is the wife's inclusion.\n\nThe problem is that the baby's presence is making the games less enjoyable. It's a valid concern. But how it was handled\u2014letting the DM bring it up\u2014might have been harsh. The author might have a point in wanting to maintain the game's quality, but they should have considered a more sensitive approach, maybe discussing it with the hosts first to find a solution together, like suggesting a babysitter if possible, or adjusting game times when the baby is asleep.\n\nThe author also mentions not wanting to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss. That's a valid concern. So they didn't push for a solution that might be financially burdensome.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the one who directly caused the conflict. The DM did, but the author shares the group's frustration. The key here is whether the author had a responsibility to handle it differently. Since they didn't act and let it escalate, maybe they're partially at fault for not finding a middle ground earlier. But the main issue was brought up by the DM, not the author.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group should have addressed the issue more tactfully, considering the hosts' feelings. The wife's reaction suggests that the way the issue was raised was hurtful. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't directly cause the conflict, but they could have helped mediate or approach it differently.\n\nSo, given all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they didn't bring up the issue directly and tried to be considerate. However, there's a nuance here. They were part of the group that felt the baby was an issue, but they didn't act until the DM did. The question is about their personal responsibility. Since they didn't directly confront the hosts, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The main fault could lie with the DM for how the issue was raised, not the author.\n"
