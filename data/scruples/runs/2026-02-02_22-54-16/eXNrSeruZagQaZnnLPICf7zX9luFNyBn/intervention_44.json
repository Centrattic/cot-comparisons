We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling the hosts that their baby is a problem during their D&D game nights.\n\nFirst, the setup: They've been meeting for three years at the hosts' home. The hosts have a baby now, which is causing disruptions. The baby is mobile, loud, and has even caused an emergency room visit once. The problem is that the baby's presence is making the game sessions stressful instead of fun. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue, but when one of the DMs brought it up, the wife reacted strongly and left the group chats.\n\nThe author's main point is that they're not the DM, so they didn't want to bring it up themselves. They felt it was a group problem since everyone was affected. But the wife took it personally, feeling excluded. The author is empathetic and regrets making her feel that way. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter because the husband is unemployed now.\n\nNow, considering the key factors: The hosts have provided a lot for the group, but the baby's presence is impacting everyone's experience. The group consensus was that it was an issue, so the author didn't act alone. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been handled poorly. The wife felt excluded, which could stem from feeling blamed or not having her needs considered.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were part of a group that decided to address the issue, which might be reasonable since they all agreed. The author's intention wasn't to exclude the wife but to find a solution that works for everyone. However, the approach might have been too abrupt or not sensitive enough, leading to the wife's strong reaction. The author might have considered alternative solutions, like adjusting the game schedule or finding a different time when the baby isn't around, but they didn't mention those. \n\nStill, since the group collectively raised the issue, the blame isn't solely on the author. They did express empathy and didn't want to hurt the wife's feelings. On the other hand, the hosts might have expected the group to be more accommodating without directly calling out the baby as the problem. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be entirely in the wrong for raising a valid concern that others shared, the way it was handled could have been more considerate. But since the author wasn't the one who initiated the conversation and felt conflicted about it, their role in the problem might be minimal. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
