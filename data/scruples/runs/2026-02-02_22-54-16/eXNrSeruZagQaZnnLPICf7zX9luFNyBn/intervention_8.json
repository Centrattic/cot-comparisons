We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is part of a D&D group that plays at a couple's house. The hosts had a baby, which started causing issues during game nights. The baby is loud, a distraction, and even led to an ER trip. The main issue is that the baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment, and when the DMs brought it up, the wife was really upset and left the group.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. They mention that they didn't bring it up themselves but felt others did. They also empathize with the wife, not wanting her to leave but understanding the group's issues. The key points here are communication and considering everyone's feelings.\n\nFirst, the problem wasn't just the author's decision\u2014it was a group consensus that the baby was an issue. The DMs brought it up, leading to the wife's reaction. The author might not be in the wrong because they weren't the one to confront the hosts directly. However, maybe they should have considered the wife's feelings more before the issue came up. But since the group as a whole had the problem, it's not just the author's fault. The hosts also need to consider the group's needs when hosting. The wife taking it personally and leaving the chats complicates things, but the author's intention wasn't to exclude her. So, the answer is probably B\u2014they're not in the wrong.\n"
