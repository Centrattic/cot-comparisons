We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group that meets at a couple's house. The hosts had a baby, and the baby is causing disruptions during game nights. The author and others in the group feel that the baby is a distraction and affecting their enjoyment. They eventually brought it up, but the wife was really upset and left the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The group had been meeting for three years, and the hosts were very accommodating. The baby is causing issues like noise, needing attention, and even an ER visit. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up but others did. The wife took it as a personal attack, leading her to leave. The author feels bad because they wanted her to be included.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention wasn't to exclude the wife but to address a problem that was affecting everyone's experience. The group collectively decided the baby was an issue, not just the author. They tried to deal with it for months before bringing it up, and the cost of a sitter isn't feasible for the husband. The wife's reaction seems extreme, especially since the issue was about the baby's impact on the game, not about her as a parent.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were part of a group decision to address a problem that was affecting everyone's enjoyment. The issue was the baby's behavior, not the wife's presence. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling judged, but the author's intent was to find a solution. So the answer is B, No.\n"
