We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions. The author says they told the hosts that the baby was a problem, leading to the wife being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The group plays D&D weekly at the hosts' home for three years. After the hosts had a baby, the baby started causing issues\u2014being loud, getting into things, causing interruptions, and even a trip to the ER once. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was a problem, but when one of the DMs brought it up, the wife reacted negatively and pulled away.\n\nThe author feels bad because they didn't want to hurt the wife's feelings, especially since she's a friend. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter because of the husband's job loss. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the author's main action was bringing up the issue. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to evaluate if it's reasonable for the author to point out the problem. \n\nOn one hand, the group is there to unwind, and the baby's presence is affecting their experience. They had tried dealing with it for months before addressing it. The author wasn't the one who brought it up; the DM did. The author supported the decision but feels guilty about the wife's reaction. They empathize with her, showing they didn't mean to exclude her.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have found another way to address the issue without directly confronting the hosts. But since the DM took the lead, and the author agreed with the group's consensus, it's a collective decision. The author's empathy is clear, and they don't want to be the one to cause harm, which shows consideration.\n\nThe hosts should have anticipated possible disruptions with a baby and maybe arranged for childcare or adjusted the game times. But they might not have expected it to get to this level. The author's intention was to preserve the group's enjoyment, which is valid. However, the way the DM approached it might have been harsh, leading to the wife's upset. The author didn't push for a babysitter, which was considerate of their financial situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted in the interest of the group's well-being, supported the DM's decision, and showed empathy. The fault might lie more on how the issue was communicated rather than the fact that it was raised. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
