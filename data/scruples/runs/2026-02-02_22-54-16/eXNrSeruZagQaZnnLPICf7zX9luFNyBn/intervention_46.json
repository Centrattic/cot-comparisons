We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the D&D game situation is in the wrong. The main issue is that the hosts of the game have a baby that's causing distractions during the sessions. The author mentions that everyone in the group agreed the baby was a problem, but when the DM brought it up, the wife reacted really negatively and left the chats.\n\nThe author is one of the players who was part of the group that acknowledged the issue. They didn't bring it up themselves because they weren't the DM and didn't want to be the one to hurt the wife's feelings. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter because they know the financial situation of the hosts. The author feels bad because their friend (the wife) is upset and they wanted her to be included.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to confirm. Let me break it down. The key points are: group consensus on the problem, the author not being the one to bring it up, empathy for the wife's feelings, and the fact that the DM did bring it up, leading to the wife's reaction.\n\nThe author didn't single-handedly confront the hosts, but they were part of a group that recognized the issue. The DM took the lead in discussing it. The author's intentions seem to be caring about both the game experience and their friend's inclusion. They tried to handle it sensitively by not pushing for a solution that would be a financial burden. The problem here is that the wife took it personally, even though the group's intention was to address the distraction, not to exclude her.\n\nIn such situations, sometimes even if the intention is good, the execution can be hurtful. But the author didn't act alone; it was a group decision that the baby was a problem, and the DM was the one who formally brought it up. The author's role was more about agreeing and supporting the discussion, not initiating it. The wife's reaction might be more about feeling excluded or the stress of being a new parent rather than the author's actions specifically.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to balance the group's needs with empathy for the hosts, especially considering the financial situation. The blame might be more on the DM for how it was brought up, but the author's role here is minimal. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
