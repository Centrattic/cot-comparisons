We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions. The author and others in the group felt the baby was a problem, but when the issue was raised by the DM, the wife reacted strongly and withdrew from the group.\n\nFirst, the author didn't bring up the issue themselves but was part of the consensus. They felt the baby was a distraction, leading to stress instead of fun. They also empathize with the wife's feelings and are upset she's upset. The key points are whether the group's actions were justified and if they handled it appropriately.\n\nThe hosts have been generous, providing space, snacks, and game materials. The baby's presence is causing interruptions, which affects everyone's enjoyment. The author didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue because they weren't the DM and were concerned about the hosts' financial situation. The DM ended up bringing it up, but the wife took it badly.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's intent wasn't to exclude the wife but to address the baby's impact on the game. The group's consensus was that the baby was an issue, which suggests a collective problem. However, bringing up such a sensitive topic can be tricky, especially when it affects a friend's participation. The author tried to avoid being the one to raise it, which shows they considered the hosts' feelings. The wife's reaction might be due to feeling blamed, especially if she's still trying to balance her new role as a mother with participating in the group.\n\nThe author might have handled it differently by perhaps discussing it privately first or finding a compromise, like hiring a babysitter if possible. But since the group collectively agreed and the DM raised it, maybe the author isn't solely at fault. The wife's withdrawal and the author's empathy suggest miscommunication rather than malice. So, the author's intentions were to maintain the group's enjoyment, but the execution might have been flawed. However, given the circumstances, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were part of a group decision and tried to be considerate.\n"
