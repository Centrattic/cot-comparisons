We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group that meets at a couple's house, and after the couple had a baby, the baby became a distraction during game nights. The author mentions that the group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment and that the DMs brought up the issue. The wife reacted negatively, saying she can't play anymore, and has become distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts have been generous in providing space and resources for the group. Having a baby is a significant life change, and it's understandable that the baby's presence might interfere with the game. However, the group is made up of adults who use these nights to unwind. The baby's impact is causing stress and disrupting the games. The author didn't want to be a jerk, so they waited for the DMs to address it. But when the DM did, the wife took it personally, which led to her withdrawing from the group.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The group did try to handle it by bringing up the issue, but the way it was communicated might have been hurtful. The wife feels excluded now, which is a valid emotional response. The author might feel guilty because they care about her as a friend. But were they wrong for participating in bringing up the issue? It's a delicate balance between group needs and individual circumstances. Since the problem was affecting everyone, the group's decision to address it isn't necessarily wrong. However, maybe there could have been a more sensitive approach, like suggesting a babysitter or adjusting game times. But the author didn't want to impose financially. It's a tough spot. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to address the issue collectively and didn't act alone. The problem is more about how the conversation was handled rather than the decision itself.\n"
