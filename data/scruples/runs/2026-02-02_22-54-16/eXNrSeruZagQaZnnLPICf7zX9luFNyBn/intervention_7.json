We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe writer is part of a D&D group that meets weekly at a couple's house. After the couple had a baby, the baby started causing distractions during game nights. The baby is mobile, makes a lot of noise, and once even led to an ER visit. The group felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment, so they discussed it. Eventually, a DM brought it up with the couple, and the wife reacted badly, removing herself from the group chats. The writer feels bad because the wife is their friend, and they don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's recent job loss.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the writer is at fault. The key points are whether the group collectively agreed the baby was an issue. The writer mentions that \"everyone came to the consensus,\" so the problem wasn't just their opinion. They didn't act alone; a DM approached the couple. The writer's role was part of the group's shared concern rather than being the one to confront the couple.\n\nThe writer also shows empathy and considers the couple's situation, especially the financial aspect. They didn't suggest a babysitter, which shows they're trying to be considerate. The wife's reaction seems extreme, but the writer isn't the one who brought up the issue; the DM did. However, the writer might feel responsible as part of the group that discussed it. \n\nBut in the context of a group activity where the environment has changed significantly (adding a baby), it's reasonable for the group to express their concerns if it's affecting their experience. The problem is that the wife took it personally and quit, which complicates things. The writer might not be in the wrong because they were part of a collective decision and didn't act out of malice. They also tried to find a solution without being harsh.\n\nAnother angle: hosting the game is the couple's home, so they have the right to have their baby there. However, the group's needs are also valid. The challenge is balancing both. The writer isn't in the wrong for participating in the discussion and letting the DM handle the conversation. The main issue might be that the group didn't approach the situation sensitively enough, but that's on the group as a whole, not the writer specifically.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the writer isn't in the wrong. They were part of a group that collectively had concerns, communicated through the DM, and considered the couple's circumstances. The wife's overreaction isn't the writer's fault. The writer's empathy and consideration for the couple's situation also support this.\n"
