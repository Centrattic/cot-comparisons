We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D scenario is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe hosts of their D&D game had a baby, which started causing issues. The baby is distracting, leading to people leaving the game, and causing stress. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue, but when the DM raised it, the wife was upset and left the group.\n\nThe author didn't bring it up initially because they didn't want to be the one to say it, and they care about the wife as a friend. Now they're questioning if they're at fault. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they didn't directly confront the hosts. They waited for someone else (the DM) to bring it up. The problem is that when the issue was raised, it hurt the wife's feelings. The author felt conflicted because they wanted to include her but also wanted their game nights to be enjoyable. \n\nBut did the author do something wrong? They didn't force the issue; they let it be addressed by the DM. However, maybe they could have handled it more delicately. But since they were part of the group that agreed it was a problem, perhaps they weren't wrong for supporting the need for a solution. The DM was the one who actually brought it up, so the author isn't the one who caused the conflict directly. \n\nThe key points: the author had empathy, didn't want to be the one to cause conflict, and tried to handle it by letting others take the lead. The wife's reaction was unexpected and harsh. The author isn't in the wrong here because they didn't act out of malice and were part of a group consensus. The main issue was how the DM approached it, not the author's involvement. So the answer is B.\n"
