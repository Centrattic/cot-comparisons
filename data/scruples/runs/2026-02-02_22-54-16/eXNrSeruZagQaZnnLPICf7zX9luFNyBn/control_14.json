We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby, and the baby is causing some issues during the game nights. The author, along with others, felt the baby was a distraction, but they were worried about bringing it up. Eventually, a DM did bring it up, and the wife took it really badly, leaving the group chats and being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the group. They've been meeting for three years, and the hosts went out of their way to host them. The baby is causing problems: noise, distractions, even an ER visit. The group was stressed and it affected their enjoyment. They all agreed the baby was an issue. But the author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so the DM did instead. The wife was upset and left the group. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for being part of the group that raised the issue.\n\nOn one hand, the group is made up of adults who need to unwind. If the baby is making the game less enjoyable and causing stress, it's understandable they'd want to address it. But on the other hand, the hosts are friends, and the wife just started playing. The problem was brought up by the DM, not the author. The author tried to avoid being the one to cause conflict. They also empathize with the wife's feelings and feel bad about it. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't act alone; the group consensus was that the baby was a problem. They tried to handle it carefully, but the DM ended up bringing it up, leading to the wife's reaction. The author's main action was being part of the conversation where the issue was discussed and agreeing that it was a problem. Did they do something wrong by expressing a valid concern about their game's environment? Or is it wrong because the hosts' personal life is affecting the group's dynamics?\n\nI think the key here is that the group had a legitimate issue with the baby's impact on their game. The author wasn't the one to bring it up but was part of the group that felt it was a problem. The wife taking it as a personal attack is unfortunate, but the group had the right to communicate their needs. The author's main mistake might be not addressing the issue more privately or finding a solution like a babysitter, but they also considered the financial situation of the hosts. However, since the group did address it and the outcome was negative, maybe the approach was wrong. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the problem existing or for participating in bringing it up. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
