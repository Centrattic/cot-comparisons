We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the D&D game situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the hosts of their game have a baby now, which is causing distractions during their game nights. The author and others felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment, leading to a discussion with the hosts, which upset the wife. The author is wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is the baby's presence during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is mobile, loud, and has caused interruptions, even leading to an ER visit once. The group, including the DM, had discussed the issue, and the author felt it necessary to bring it up. However, the wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nNow, considering the group's consensus, they all agreed the baby was a problem. The author wasn't the one to bring it up initially but was part of the discussion. The author also shows empathy towards the wife, acknowledging her feelings and the husband's job loss. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the group had a right to express their concerns, especially since the game nights are important for their relaxation. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been insensitive. The wife's reaction suggests she felt excluded from the games, which were a way for her to connect. The author's empathy is evident, but the problem might stem from not addressing the issue more constructively.\n\nBut the main points are: the group had a consensus, the author was part of that and tried to be considerate, and the wife's reaction was extreme. The author isn't suggesting a solution like a babysitter, which might be a better approach, but that's not feasible due to financial reasons. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they were part of a group effort to communicate a problem that affects everyone, even if it hurt someone's feelings. It's a difficult situation where there's no perfect solution, but the author acted in good faith to maintain the group's enjoyment while being empathetic.\n"
