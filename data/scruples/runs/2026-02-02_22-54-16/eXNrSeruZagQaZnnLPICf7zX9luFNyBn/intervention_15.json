We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group that meets weekly at a friend's house. The hosts had a baby, and the baby is causing issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. It's even led to an ER visit because they thought the baby ate something dangerous. The wife, who started playing D&D, was having to leave the game to take care of the baby, which disrupted the game. The author and others felt the baby was affecting everyone's enjoyment. They eventually brought it up, but the wife was upset and left the group chats.\n\nThe author didn't want to be the one to bring it up because they weren't the DM, but they did support when someone else did. They also feel bad about the wife's reaction and empathize with her. The author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nSo, the key points here are: the group's game nights are important to them as a way to unwind. The baby's presence is causing real disruptions. The author and others felt it was affecting their experience. They tried to address it, but the wife took it personally. The author is worried they're in the wrong because they hurt a friend's feelings.\n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable for the group to express concerns about their shared activity being disrupted. The baby's presence is causing stress and affecting the game. The author didn't act alone; others felt the same. They tried to handle it respectfully, even considering the financial situation of the hosts. The main issue was brought up by a DM, not the author.\n\nOn the other hand, bringing up such a sensitive topic could be seen as insensitive, especially since the wife had recently joined and was excited to be part of the group. The wife's reaction might be because she felt her inclusion was being taken away, and maybe she wasn't expecting the group to prioritize the game over her new role as a mother. The author's empathy is noted, but maybe there was a better way to handle it, like suggesting a babysitter or adjusting game times.\n\nBut the author tried to be considerate, and the problem was a consensus among the group. They didn't want to ask for money for a sitter because they knew the husband was unemployed. So, their hands might be tied. The main issue is whether the group's right to an enjoyable game night overrides the wife's right to participate with her baby.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they had a valid concern that was shared by others. They tried to address it respectfully and didn't act alone. The wife's reaction is more about how it was communicated rather than the issue itself. So, answer B.\n"
