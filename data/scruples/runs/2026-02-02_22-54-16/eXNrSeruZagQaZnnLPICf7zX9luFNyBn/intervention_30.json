We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the D&D hosts that their baby is causing issues. The situation is that the hosts have a baby who's been a distraction during game nights, leading to stress and affecting the game. The author didn't bring it up themselves, but others did, and the wife reacted badly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group has been meeting for three years, and the hosts rearrange their home for them. The baby is mobile, loud, and has caused ER visits once. The game nights are important for the group to unwind. The author felt conflicted because the wife is a friend and the author wanted her to be included. The problem was brought up by a DM, not the author directly. The wife's reaction was strong, feeling excluded, and she's upset. The author is empathetic but also concerned about the group's enjoyment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and group dynamics. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a group consensus that the baby was an issue. But did they have the right to voice it? The author didn't bring it up themselves, so maybe they're not the one responsible for the confrontation. However, they participated in the group's decision to address the issue, which the DM then communicated. The author's empathy is clear, but the problem was real. The hosts might have expected the group to be more understanding given their personal situation. The wife feeling excluded is a valid reaction. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the group's right to enjoy their hobby without undue stress and the hosts' situation with a newborn. The author's intention wasn't to exclude the wife but to maintain the game's quality. But the way the issue was brought up might have been harsh, leading to the wife's upset. The author's role here is a bit indirect since they didn't bring it up themselves. However, being part of the group consensus might mean shared responsibility. \n\nBut in the end, the author's actions were to voice a concern that others shared, which is a normal part of group communication. The main issue is how the DM approached the hosts. So, the author isn't the one who brought it up, so they might not be in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
