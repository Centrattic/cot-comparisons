We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the D&D situation is at fault (AITA). The scenario involves a group that plays D&D weekly at a couple's home, but after the couple had a baby, the baby became a distraction. The host couple's wife then left the group after a DM mentioned the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The hosts had been accommodating, providing space and snacks. The wife joined the game, which was exciting. But the baby's presence started causing disruptions: noise, safety issues, and interruptions during the game. The group collectively felt it was affecting their enjoyment. The person in question didn't bring it up themselves but agreed with others when the issue was finally addressed. The wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded, and the author feels bad for their friend.\n\nThe key points to evaluate are: Did the author do something wrong? They didn't raise the issue themselves, but others did. They felt empathy for the wife and didn't want to suggest a costly solution like a babysitter. The main conflict is whether the group was right to address the baby's impact on their game nights and if the author shares responsibility for that decision.\n\nPossible angles: The author might be seen as not taking responsibility early enough, contributing to the problem by not speaking up. Alternatively, the group's consensus to address the issue is valid, and the author isn't at fault since they weren't the one to bring it up. The wife's reaction might be due to feeling blamed, but the group's right to enjoy their game is also a factor. Since the author didn't act unkindly and tried to be empathetic, it's more about a difficult situation rather than wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author supported a group decision made by the DMs, didn't act out of malice, and felt empathy towards the wife. The main issue is a clash between the group's needs and the new parent's circumstances, not the author's personal fault.\n"
