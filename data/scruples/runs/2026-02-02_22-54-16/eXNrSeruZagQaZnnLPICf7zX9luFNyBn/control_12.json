We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up that the baby is a problem in their D&D game. \n\nFirst, the situation: The group has been meeting for 3 years, hosted by a couple. Then they had a baby, which started causing issues\u2014noises, distractions, the baby even went to the ER once. The author wasn't the one to bring it up first; it was one of the DMs. The author felt that the baby was affecting everyone's enjoyment because they're busy adults needing to unwind. The problem was discussed among the group, and they all agreed it was an issue. But when the DM brought it up, the wife reacted strongly and pulled out of the group.\n\nSo, the author's question is whether they're at fault. The key points here are that the author didn't initiate the conversation but was part of the group that came to a consensus. They had empathy for the wife and didn't want to make her feel excluded, but the baby's presence was making the game stressful. The author didn't suggest a babysitter because they know the couple's financial situation.\n\nI need to consider if the author had a valid reason to voice the issue. Since the group collectively agreed the baby was a problem, it's not just the author's opinion. The author's intention was to maintain the group's enjoyment, which is understandable. However, the way the issue was brought up might have hurt the wife, but the author wasn't the one who started the conversation. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the decision to address the baby's impact on the game. \n\nThe author's empathy is noted, but maybe they could have approached it more carefully. However, since the group already had a consensus, the author wasn't wrong for being part of that. So the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), because the problem was real and the author was trying to maintain the group dynamic, even though the outcome hurt feelings. The fault might lie more with how the DM presented the issue, not the author's participation in the group's decision.\n"
