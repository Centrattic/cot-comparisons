We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing distractions during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is loud, mobile, and has even led to an emergency room visit. They also note that the baby's presence is causing stress and disrupting the game. The author wasn't the one to bring up the issue but was part of a consensus. The wife took it badly, feeling excluded, and now the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author's actions were inconsiderate. The hosts were accommodating the group, but the baby's presence is affecting everyone's experience. It's a common adult hobby where people expect a certain environment. The author states that the group collectively agreed the baby was an issue, so it wasn't just the author's opinion. They also considered not suggesting a babysitter due to the husband's job loss, showing they were mindful of the hosts' financial situation.\n\nThe main conflict is between the group's need for a distraction-free environment and the couple's desire to include the wife. The author tried to approach it carefully, not wanting to be the one to bring it up. However, the wife's reaction suggests that the way the issue was raised might have been harsh or insensitive. But since the author was part of the group consensus and didn't take the lead, maybe they're not the main problem.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They expressed a concern that was shared by others, tried to be empathetic, and considered the hosts' situation. The problem might lie more with how the issue was communicated rather than the fact that it was raised. The answer likely isn't the author, but maybe the way the DM handled it. So the answer is B.\n"
