We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for telling the D&D hosts that their baby is an issue. The situation is that the group started playing D&D at the couple's house, and after they had a baby, the baby started causing disruptions. The group felt it was affecting their game experience, and someone brought it up to the couple, leading to the wife being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The hosts are friends, and the group appreciates their effort to host. The baby is mobile and noisy, causing interruptions and even a trip to the ER once. The group consensus was that the baby was a problem. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, but another DM did, and the wife reacted badly, saying she can't play again. The author is feeling guilty because they wanted her to stay involved as a friend.\n\nSo, the key points here: Was it wrong to address the issue? The group collectively felt it was a problem, so it wasn't just the author's opinion. The author didn't bring it up directly but was part of the group that decided to address it. The hosts are friends, and the baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author is empathetic towards the wife's feelings but concerned about the group's needs.\n\nPossible angles: Are they inconsiderate for bringing up the baby's impact? Maybe, but the group is made of adults who need a stress-free environment. On the other hand, the hosts have a baby, which is a significant life change. The author is not blaming the baby but the situation. The wife's reaction is extreme, but the issue was valid. The author isn't suggesting a solution like a babysitter due to the husband's unemployment, showing they considered the hosts' situation.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances. The group had a legitimate problem affecting their time together. Addressing it isn't inherently wrong. The author's role was part of the group's consensus. The wife's reaction might be an overreaction, but the author isn't at fault for the outcome. So, likely the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
