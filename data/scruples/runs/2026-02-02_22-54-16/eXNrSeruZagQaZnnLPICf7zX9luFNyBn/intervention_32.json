We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a D&D group that meets at a couple's home. The couple has a baby now, which is causing some issues during game nights. The baby is mobile, loud, and has even gone to the ER once. The wife, who started playing, has to leave to take care of the baby, causing interruptions. The author and others felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. They tried dealing with it for a few months, then one of the DMs approached the couple, and the wife reacted negatively, leaving the group chats and being upset.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty because they wanted the wife to be included. They don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the couple's financial situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and empathy. The author didn't initiate the conversation but was part of a group consensus that the baby was an issue. They were worried about the wife's feelings. The DM did bring it up, and the wife's reaction was harsh. The author's intention wasn't to exclude her but to address the problem that was affecting everyone's experience.\n\nIs it fair to say the author is wrong for being part of the effort to address the baby's impact? Or was it reasonable to discuss the issue since it's affecting the group's enjoyment? The author didn't act alone; others agreed. They also considered the couple's situation, like not suggesting a babysitter because they know it's expensive and the husband was laid off. That shows they tried to be considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife should have been considered more in how the issue was brought up. But the author wasn't the one who initiated the conversation. The problem here is whether the group's desire for game nights to be enjoyable is valid versus accommodating the couple's new parent realities.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to communicate the issue in a group setting, weren't the one to bring it up directly, and showed empathy. They also considered financial aspects. The main issue might be how the DM approached the couple, not the author's involvement in the group's consensus. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
