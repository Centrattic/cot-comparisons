So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted about not wanting smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their baby is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out the answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the person is a new parent, and their main concerns are about secondhand smoke and whooping cough. They don't want smokers to hold their baby because of the smell and potential secondhand exposure, even if those people claim to have washed their hands. Also, they don't want people without the updated whooping cough vaccine to be near the baby. Others are calling them a bitch for setting these boundaries.\n\nSo, the key points here: secondhand smoke and whooping cough. Let's break it down. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. It can cause respiratory issues and other health problems. Just because someone washed their hands doesn't eliminate the risk of secondhand smoke exposure. The smoke lingers on clothing and in the environment, so keeping smokers away is a valid health precaution for a baby.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious illness for infants, especially those under six months. The updated vaccine is recommended because immunity can wane over time. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, they might not be protected and could potentially transmit the disease to the baby. The person is being cautious by not allowing unvaccinated individuals near the baby. That's a common precaution for newborns, especially since they can't get the vaccine yet.\n\nThe other people's reactions are dismissive, saying the person is a bitch. That's a bit harsh. Setting boundaries around the health and safety of their child should be respected. Parents have the right to protect their children from preventable health risks. The fact that the smokers are near the baby's bouncer and front door adds to the concern because it's a high-traffic area where the baby is present.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They're making health-conscious decisions to protect their infant. The other people's judgment isn't justified here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
