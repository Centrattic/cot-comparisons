So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user, a new parent, is asking if they're at fault for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. They mentioned two main reasons: people who smoke and people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. The smokers are told they've washed their hands and shower daily, but the parent doesn't want them to hold the baby because of the smell and secondhand smoke. Also, they don't allow unvaccinated people (specifically against Whooping Cough) near the baby. Others are calling them a bitch for this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the smoking issue. The parent is concerned about secondhand smoke. Even if the smokers wash their hands and shower, they might still carry the smell of smoke on their clothes or in their hair. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants, increasing the risk of respiratory infections, SIDS, etc. So, from a health perspective, not allowing smokers to hold the baby is reasonable. The fact that others are dismissing this as the parent being a \"bitch\" might be because they don't take the health risks seriously. But the parent's stance is about protecting the baby's health, which is a valid concern.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) can be deadly for infants. The vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time, so updated boosters are recommended for adults who are in contact with babies. If some people haven't had the updated vaccine, they could potentially spread the disease. The parent's policy here is also about protecting the baby from a serious illness. The fact that others argue the vaccine isn't needed might be due to misinformation or misunderstanding. The parent is acting in the baby's best interest here.\n\nThe parent is actively avoiding interaction with these people, which could strain relationships. But is that wrong? If they're prioritizing their child's safety and health, it's their right as a parent. The criticism from others might stem from not understanding the risks or feeling excluded. However, the parent isn't being cruel; they're making a health-based decision. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parent isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate health concerns and are making choices to protect their newborn. The answer should be B (No).\n"
