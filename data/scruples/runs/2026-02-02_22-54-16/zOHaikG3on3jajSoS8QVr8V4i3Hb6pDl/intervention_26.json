So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are that some people smoke and others haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Smoke exposure is a real concern for infants. Secondhand smoke can lead to respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other problems. Even if the people wash their hands, the smell and residue from smoking can linger on their clothes and skin. So, not allowing smokers to hold the baby seems like a reasonable precaution.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis is highly contagious and can be deadly for newborns. The vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time, so boosters are recommended. If some people haven't updated their vaccine, they could be a risk. The author is being cautious here, which makes sense given the vulnerability of a two-month-old.\n\nThe other people are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is dismissive and not helpful. The author is trying to protect their child, which is a parent's duty. The reasons provided are health-related and justified. The responses from others seem to downplay the actual risks, focusing on handwashing and showers, which might not be sufficient in these cases.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting in the best interest of their child. They have valid concerns based on medical advice. The people who criticize them might not understand the severity of the risks involved. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
