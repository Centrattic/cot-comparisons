So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves not wanting smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The parent doesn't want smokers near the baby because of secondhand smoke exposure, even if the smokers wash their hands. They also don't want people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near the baby. Others are calling them a \"bitch\" for these preferences.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Let's break it down. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, especially for infants. Even if a smoker washes their hands, they might still carry residual smoke on their clothing or in their environment. The parent's reason is valid from a health perspective. \n\nRegarding the vaccine, Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants. The vaccine is recommended for close contacts of newborns, so the parent's precaution is medically sound. The fact that others don't update their vaccine might be a point of contention, but the parent's choice is based on protecting their child.\n\nThe other people's reactions (calling the parent a bitch) could stem from not understanding the health risks or feeling excluded. However, the parent's stance is about their child's well-being, which typically takes precedence. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, setting boundaries is acceptable. The parent is not forcing others to get vaccinated or quit smoking, just choosing not to allow them to hold the baby. That's a personal choice and not something that makes them in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). They have valid health-based reasons for their decisions, which are important for protecting a vulnerable infant.\n"
