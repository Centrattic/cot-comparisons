So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not wanting smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. They've explained their reasons related to secondhand smoke and whooping cough risk, but others are calling them a bitch for setting these boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. Smoking is harmful, especially to infants. Secondhand smoke can cause serious health issues like respiratory infections, SIDS, and other complications. Even if someone washes their hands, the smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on their clothes and skin. So, the author's concern about avoiding that is valid. \n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough is a serious respiratory infection that can be deadly for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in close contact with babies. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccine, they could pose a risk. The author's insistence on up-to-date vaccination is a protective measure. \n\nOther people's reactions, calling the author a bitch, might stem from not understanding the medical reasons or feeling their autonomy is being restricted. But the author has the right to set boundaries to protect their child's health. It's their responsibility as a parent to make decisions based on medical advice.\n\nI should check if there are any cultural or social norms that might influence this. In some circles, such strict boundaries might be seen as excessive, but from a health perspective, they're justified. The author isn't forcing others to change their habits; they're just limiting who interacts with their baby. \n\nAlso, considering that the author is the parent, they have the authority to make these decisions. The criticism from others about being a \"bitch\" is dismissive of legitimate health concerns. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
