So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are:\n\n1. The author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands, because of secondhand smoke and the smell. The smokers live near the baby's bouncer and smoke at the front door.\n\n2. They also don't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Some people argue it's not necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the validity of each concern. \n\nStarting with the smoking issue. Secondhand smoke is a well-documented health risk for infants. The CDC and other health organizations advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can cause respiratory problems, SIDS, and other issues. The author's concern is legitimate. Even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and skin, which the baby can inhale. So the author is taking a precaution that's actually recommended by health authorities. \n\nThen there's the issue of the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is very dangerous for infants. The AAP recommends that caregivers be up-to-date with their pertussis vaccination. The author is requiring the updated vaccine, which is reasonable. If some people haven't had the updated version, it's possible their immunity isn't sufficient, especially since immunity can wane over time. The author is trying to protect their baby from a preventable disease.\n\nNow, considering the reactions of others calling the author a \"bitch.\" The author is setting boundaries based on health concerns. People might not like those boundaries, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The right to protect one's child from known health risks is a parental right. The other people's hygiene and smoking habits are their own issues, but the author is prioritizing the baby's health.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The author is actively avoiding these people, both not inviting them over and avoiding their houses. This could affect relationships, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The core issue is the health of the baby. The author's actions are preventive measures advised by medical guidelines. So medically, their concerns are valid. Socially, others might feel excluded, but the author isn't obligated to put the baby at risk for the sake of socializing.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a parent, and parents often need to make tough decisions to protect their children. The fact that they are taking these precautions shows they are informed and proactive. The criticism from others seems to be dismissing legitimate health concerns, which isn't fair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are justified by public health recommendations. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
