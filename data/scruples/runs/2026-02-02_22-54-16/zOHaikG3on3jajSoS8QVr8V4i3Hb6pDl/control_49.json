So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The author is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. They explained their reasons: avoiding secondhand smoke exposure and preventing whooping cough. Others are calling them a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Smoke exposure, even if they wash their hands, can still be harmful. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, causing respiratory issues and SIDS. So the author's concern is valid. Also, whooping cough (pertussis) is extremely dangerous for newborns, and the vaccine is recommended for anyone in close contact. The people not updated on the vaccine might not realize the risk, but the author is justified in requiring the vaccine to protect their baby.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. People might feel offended, but parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. The author isn't being mean for no reason; they have legitimate health concerns. The fact that others don't take the hygiene and vaccination seriously is on them, not the parent. The author is protecting their child, which is a parent's duty.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have valid health reasons, and it's reasonable to prioritize their baby's safety. The criticism from others is unwarranted because the author is making responsible choices for their child's protection."
