So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote theAITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong regarding not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The key points are their reasons: not allowing smokers near the baby and requiring the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The parent is concerned about secondhand smoke exposure. Even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes and skin, which is a valid health concern. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, causing respiratory issues and other health problems. The smokers argue that they have good hygiene, but that doesn't eliminate the risk of smoke particles clinging to them. So, the parent's stance here seems reasonable from a health and safety perspective.\n\nNext, the whooping cough vaccine. The parent requires the updated vaccine, which others are refusing. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious illness, especially for infants. The vaccine is a standard recommendation for people coming into contact with newborns. The fact that some people haven't updated their vaccine is a risk the parent is rightly concerned about. The argument that they don't need the update might be based on a misunderstanding of vaccination guidelines. The parent's decision to exclude them is a precaution to protect the baby's health.\n\nThe backlash the parent faces, being called a \"bitch,\" seems unfair. Health concerns, especially for a vulnerable infant, are legitimate reasons to set boundaries. The parent is prioritizing their child's safety, which is a natural and responsible action. The reactions from others might stem from not fully understanding the health risks involved or feeling personally attacked, but that doesn't make the parent wrong in their decisions.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent is not in the wrong. They're taking necessary precautions to protect their newborn, and their reasons are valid and supported by health advice. The answer should be B.\n"
