So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are the objections to smokers and lack of updated Whooping Cough vaccines.\n\nFirst, the writer doesn't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands. The reasoning is about secondhand smoke and the smell. The commenters call them a \"bitch,\" which seems harsh. But is the writer wrong? Smoking is known to be harmful. Even if someone washes their hands, their clothes and body might still carry the smell and residue. Plus, smoking near the baby's bouncer in the house could expose the baby to secondhand smoke, which is dangerous. So, from a health perspective, avoiding smokers around an infant makes sense.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. The writer requires the updated version. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants, especially under six months. The vaccine's protection wanes over time, so an updated shot is important for close contacts. If others don't get the updated vaccine, they risk exposing the baby. The writer is justified in being cautious here.\n\nThe response from others is to say the writer is a \"bitch,\" which seems dismissive of valid health concerns. The writer is protecting their child's well-being. Even if others don't see the risk, the parents' primary role is to safeguard their child. The writer isn't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing the baby's health. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
