So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new parent setting boundaries about who can hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are not allowing smokers and requiring the pertussis vaccine.\n\nFirst, the parent doesn't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands. The reasoning is to prevent the baby from being exposed to secondhand smoke and the smell lingering on the child or their clothes. The smokers in question are told they're a \"bitch\" for not allowing them to hold the baby. Then there's the part about the whooping cough vaccine\u2014some people haven't gotten the updated version, and the parent won't let them near the baby. The others argue it's not necessary.\n\nNow, considering the health risks. Secondhand smoke is a known danger for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can cause sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory issues, and other health problems. Even if the smokers wash their hands, the residue from smoke (like nicotine and other chemicals) can remain on their skin and clothes, which is called thirdhand smoke. That's a real concern for a baby's health.\n\nRegarding the whooping cough vaccine, the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't been vaccinated, especially those in contact with infants. Pertussis can be severe in babies, leading to pneumonia, brain damage, or death. The parent's stance here is about protecting the baby from a preventable disease. The fact that others claim they don't need the updated vaccine might be based on misinformation or misunderstanding of current medical guidelines.\n\nThe parent is setting boundaries, which is a personal choice, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. From a medical and health perspective, the parent's actions are justified. However, socially, some might see it as being overly strict or exclusionary. But given the potential risks, the parent's decisions are based on protecting their child's health. The reactions from others calling the parent a \"bitch\" suggest they don't see the health risks as significant, but that doesn't make the parent wrong in their stance.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their actions are based on valid health concerns for their infant, and they have the right to set such boundaries for their child's safety."
