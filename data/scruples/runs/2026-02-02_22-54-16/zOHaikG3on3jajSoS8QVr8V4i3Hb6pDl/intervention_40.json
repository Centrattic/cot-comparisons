So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter because they smoke and haven't updated their whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke exposure, which is a valid health concern. Smoking near the baby, even if they wash their hands, can leave residues and the smell on their clothes, which can be harmful. The American Academy of Pediatrics does advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can lead to respiratory issues and other health problems. So, from a health perspective, the author's stance is reasonable.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine part. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious illness for infants, especially those under six months. The vaccine is crucial because the bacteria can be spread through respiratory droplets. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, they might be carriers and could pass it to the baby. The CDC recommends that all adults and adolescents get a Tdap vaccine to protect against pertussis when around infants. Therefore, the author's precaution here is also justified based on medical guidelines.\n\nThe author mentions that people are calling them a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries. But personal boundaries, especially regarding the health and safety of a child, are important. It's reasonable for parents to set limits to protect their child's well-being, even if others find it inconvenient or feel disrespected. The key here is that the author is making decisions based on their child's best interests, not out of spite or unnecessary judgment.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's a middle ground. For example, maybe the author could explain the health reasons more clearly to those involved, so they understand it's not a personal attack but a protective measure. But the question isn't about possible compromises; it's whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe criticism from others about washing hands and showering doesn't address the actual risks. Washing hands doesn't remove secondhand smoke particles from clothing, and the vaccine status is a separate issue. So the author's reasoning isn't based on hygiene in the traditional sense but on preventing exposure to harmful substances and diseases.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are based on valid health concerns supported by medical advice. They are setting boundaries to protect their infant, which is their right. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
