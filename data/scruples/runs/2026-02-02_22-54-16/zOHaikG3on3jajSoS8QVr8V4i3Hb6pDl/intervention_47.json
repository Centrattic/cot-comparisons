So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are the author's restrictions on smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. Secondhand smoke is a significant risk for infants, causing issues like respiratory infections and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Even if someone has washed their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and skin, which the baby can inhale. The author's concern here is valid and backed by health guidelines. \n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is dangerous for infants, especially under six months. The vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time, so updated boosters are recommended for close contacts. If people haven't had the updated vaccine, they might not have sufficient immunity to protect the baby. The author is prioritizing the baby's safety here, which makes sense.\n\nThe author is being upfront about their rules and avoiding situations where these people are present. They're not being confrontational but setting clear boundaries. The people they're excluding are criticizing them as a \"bitch,\" which seems unfair given the health stakes.\n\nI should also consider if the author is overstepping. While it's their home and their child, the reasons given are legitimate health precautions. There's no evidence the author is being unnecessarily strict. Smokers and unvaccinated individuals pose real risks, so the author's decisions are reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They're making responsible choices to protect their infant's health, and their boundaries are justified. The answer should be B.\n"
