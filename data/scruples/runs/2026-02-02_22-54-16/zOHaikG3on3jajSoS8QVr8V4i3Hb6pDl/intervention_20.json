So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author's main concerns are about smokers and people not having the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the smokers. The author doesn't want them to hold the baby even if they've washed their hands. The reasoning is about secondhand smoke and the smell. I know that secondhand smoke is a serious health risk, especially for infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell from their clothes or their presence near the baby can still be harmful. The CDC and other health organizations definitely advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. So, the author's stance here seems medically justified.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. The author requires the updated vaccine, but some people think it's not necessary. Whooping Cough can be deadly for newborns because their immune systems are still developing. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in close contact with infants. People who haven't been vaccinated are at higher risk of spreading the disease. So, the author's precaution here is also backed by medical advice.\n\nThe author is facing criticism from others, being called a \"bitch,\" but their actions are based on valid health concerns. It's about protecting a vulnerable infant. While it might come off as strict, the intentions are protective, not malicious. The other people's reactions might stem from not understanding the severity of the risks involved. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for their decisions, supported by health guidelines. Their actions are about safeguarding their child's health. The answer should be B.\n"
