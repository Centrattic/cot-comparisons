So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are that some people smoke and others haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. The author is getting criticized by others for being a \"bitch\" for these restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Smoking around infants is a big concern. Secondhand smoke is harmful, especially to babies. Even if a smoker has washed their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes and skin, which the baby could inhale. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding secondhand smoke around infants, so the author's stance here is likely medically supported. The other people's argument about washing hands and showering is invalid because it doesn't eliminate the smoke residue.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine is another important point. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for anyone in close contact with infants because pertussis can be deadly for newborns. If some people haven't updated their vaccine, they could pose a risk even if they're healthy. The author is trying to protect the baby from preventable diseases, which is a responsible decision.\n\nThe people who are upset might be feeling excluded or not wanting to change their habits. They might not understand the severity of the risks. However, the author's reasons are valid and based on protecting their child. The criticism towards the author being a \"bitch\" seems unfair. It's about the parents' rights to set boundaries for their child's safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate health-based reasons for their decisions. The answer should be B (No).\n"
