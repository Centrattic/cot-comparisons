So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not allowing smokers or those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the author has clear reasons: they don't want secondhand smoke exposure and the risk of whooping cough, which is a serious illness for infants. The CDC and other health organizations do recommend avoiding secondhand smoke around babies because it can cause health issues like SIDS, respiratory infections, and other problems. So from a health perspective, the author's stance is valid.\n\nThe author also mentions that the people in question smoke a pack a day. Even if they wash their hands, the smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on their skin, clothes, and hair. This is a real concern as thirdhand smoke has harmful chemicals that can affect a baby's health. So the author is protecting their child from potential exposure through multiple channels.\n\nRegarding the vaccines, whooping cough (pertussis) is highly contagious and dangerous for infants. The AAP recommends that all caregivers be up to date with the Tdap vaccine. If some people haven't gotten the updated vaccine, the author is justified in not wanting them near the baby to prevent any risk of transmission. \n\nThe criticism from others that the author is a \"bitch\" seems dismissive of valid health precautions. The author is prioritizing their child's safety based on medical advice. It's reasonable for parents to set boundaries to protect their children, especially for a newborn who is more vulnerable.\n\nSo combining health guidelines with the author's protective measures, it seems the author is not in the wrong. They are acting in their child's best interest based on medical recommendations. The answer should be B.\n"
