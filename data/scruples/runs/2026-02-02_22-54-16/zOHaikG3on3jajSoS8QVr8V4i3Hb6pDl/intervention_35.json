So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who's setting boundaries regarding who can hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are not allowing smokers to hold the baby and requiring the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. The author is being criticized by others for these rules, even though they have valid health concerns. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, increasing the chance of respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other issues. The CDC and other health organizations advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. So, the parent's concern about smokers isn't unfounded. Even if someone washes their hands or showers, the smoke residue on their clothes (thirdhand smoke) can still be harmful. The parent's stance here is protective.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in contact with infants. Pertussis can be deadly for newborns because their immune systems are weak, and the vaccine's protection wanes over time. So the parent's requirement for the updated vaccine makes sense from a medical standpoint.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding people who don't meet these criteria. Others are calling them a \"bitch,\" but that's likely because they don't understand the health risks. The parent's actions are about protecting their child's health, which is a primary responsibility. \n\nThere's no mention of the author being unreasonable in other areas. They're clear in their boundaries, which is reasonable. The criticism from others may stem from a lack of awareness about the specific risks or their own defensiveness. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They're taking reasonable precautions to safeguard their child's health. The answer should be B.\n"
