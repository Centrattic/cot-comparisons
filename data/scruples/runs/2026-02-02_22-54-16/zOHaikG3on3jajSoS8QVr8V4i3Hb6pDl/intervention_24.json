So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not allowing smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old. \n\nFirst, the author's concerns are about secondhand smoke and pertussis (whooping cough). Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants, causing respiratory issues and other health problems. Even if someone washes their hands, the smoke residue on their clothes and skin (thirdhand smoke) can still affect the baby. So the author's stance on smokers makes sense medically.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect against pertussis, which is very dangerous for infants. The author is right to require it since the bacteria can be transmitted easily and is deadly for newborns. The people they mention not getting the updated vaccine are putting the baby at risk, regardless of other vaccinations.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries for their child's safety. People might not agree, but protecting a child's health is a parent's right. The reactions from others calling the author a \"bitch\" seem unwarranted. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're being cautious based on valid health concerns. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. Both decisions are medically sound and aim to protect the baby from serious health risks. The other people's hygiene or vaccine status isn't the author's responsibility if it directly affects the child's safety.\n"
