So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. They explained their reasons: avoiding secondhand smoke exposure and preventing whooping cough. The others are calling them a bitch for setting these boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. Whooping cough is a serious disease, especially for infants. The vaccine is crucial because babies can't get vaccinated until they're two months old, and the protection from the mother's antibodies might not be enough. The writer is being proactive to protect their child, which is a common concern among parents. So, that part seems justified.\n\nThen there's the smoking issue. Secondhand smoke is harmful to infants, increasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and other health problems. Even if the smokers wash their hands, they might carry smoke particles on their clothes and skin. The writer is concerned about the smell and potential health risks, which is valid. The fact that they smoke near the front door, close to the baby's bouncer, adds to the risk. The other people's argument that washing hands and showering makes it okay is probably not sufficient, as smoke lingers on clothing and in the environment.\n\nThe writer is setting boundaries to protect their child, which is a parent's right. Others might not like the rules, but the health and safety of the baby should come first. The writer isn't being mean without reason; they're making informed decisions based on medical advice. The others are pushing back, but it's the parent's responsibility to decide what's best for their child. So, the writer isn't in the wrong here. They're acting in their child's best interest, so the answer should be B, No.\n"
