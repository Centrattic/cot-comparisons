So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the new parent not wanting smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is definitely a concern for infants because it can lead to respiratory issues and other health problems. The parent is concerned about the smell and potential exposure, which is valid. The smokers in question are washing their hands and showering, but the parent is still worried. However, washing hands and showering might not fully remove the nicotine residue from their hair, skin, or clothes, which can still pose a risk. \n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis is a serious disease for infants, and the Tdap vaccine is recommended for anyone in close contact with a baby. If some people haven't updated their vaccine, that's a risk. The parent is not allowing them near the baby for that reason. \n\nThe other people are calling the parent a bitch, but are they right to do so? From a health perspective, the parent's concerns are legitimate. The smokers might argue that they're clean, but the parent's decision is about protecting the baby's health. Similarly, the vaccination issue is about preventing a serious disease. \n\nSo, the parent is making decisions based on their child's well-being. The other people might be offended, but the parent isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's health. The answer should be B, No.\n"
