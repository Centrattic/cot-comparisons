So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is refusing to let certain people hold their two-month-old daughter because they smoke and haven't updated their Whooping Cough vaccine. The people in question argue that washing hands and showering daily is enough, and the author is being called a \"bitch.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Smoking is a big concern because secondhand smoke is harmful, especially for infants. The CDC and other health organizations do recommend avoiding secondhand smoke for babies. So the author's reasoning here is valid. Also, the Whooping Cough vaccine is crucial because the disease can be deadly for infants. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults to protect against pertussis, which is especially important around young babies. If the people haven't updated their vaccine, they could be a risk.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries for their child's safety. Even though the people argue that hygiene is sufficient, the author is prioritizing medical advice. The fact that they're avoiding their homes or not having them over might be seen as strict, but given the stakes, it's a reasonable precaution. The reactions from others calling the author a \"bitch\" could be due to not understanding the medical reasons or being defensive about their habits. \n\nThe key points here are the health risks associated with smoking and lack of vaccination. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their child. It's their right to set these boundaries to ensure their baby's safety. The people in question might not agree, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
