So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not allowing smokers or those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author faces criticism for being a \"bitch,\" but they have their reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author's actions are justified. Let's break down the two main points: the smoking issue and the vaccine requirement.\n\nFor smoking, the author is concerned about secondhand smoke exposure. Even if smokers have washed their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes and skin, which could be harmful to the baby. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants, increasing the risk of respiratory issues and SIDS. The smokers in question also smoke near the front door, where the baby's bouncer is, which adds to the exposure risk. The author's stance here seems reasonable from a health and safety perspective.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, pertussis is highly contagious and extremely dangerous for newborns, who can't receive the vaccine until they're a few months old. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect infants. If others refuse to get the updated vaccine, the author is justified in keeping them away to prevent potential infection. Pertussis can be life-threatening for a baby, so this precaution makes sense.\n\nThe author is being criticized for being harsh, but protecting a newborn is a priority. The reasons are based on health risks, not personal dislike. The people involved may not understand the severity of the risks, but that doesn't make the author wrong for taking precautions. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
