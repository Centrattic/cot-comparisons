So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about secondhand smoke exposure. Smokers have been told not to hold the baby, even if they wash their hands, because the smell lingers and they smoke near the baby's bouncer. Then there's the vaccine part: the author doesn't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby. Some people argue they don't need the update, but the author is strict about it.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is setting boundaries for their child's safety. Secondhand smoke is a known health risk for infants, increasing the risk of SIDS and other respiratory issues. Even if a smoker washes their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and skin, which can be harmful. So, the author is trying to protect the baby from that.\n\nRegarding the vaccine, Whooping Cough (pertussis) is very dangerous for infants. The vaccine can wear off over time, so getting an updated booster is recommended. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, they could be contagious even if they were vaccinated before. The author's choice to restrict contact with those people is about reducing the risk of the baby getting a severe illness.\n\nThe other people are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which seems harsh. The author's actions are based on health and safety concerns, not personal dislike. It's their right to set these boundaries to protect their child. They\u2019re not being inconsiderate; they\u2019re prioritizing the baby's well-being.\n\nSo, considering health guidelines and the potential risks, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decisions are based on protecting their child from preventable health hazards. The people criticizing them might not understand the severity of these risks. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
