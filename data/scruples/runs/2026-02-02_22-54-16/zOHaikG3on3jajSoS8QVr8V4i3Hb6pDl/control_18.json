So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are not wanting smokers near the baby and requiring the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, about the smoking part. The author doesn't want smokers to hold their baby, even if they've washed their hands. Others are criticizing them as a \"bitch\" because the smokers shower daily. But I remember that secondhand smoke is harmful, especially for infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes and skin. Plus, if they smoke near the baby's bouncer, that's direct exposure. So the author's concern seems valid from a health perspective. The smokers' hygiene isn't the main issue here; the actual smoke exposure is. So the author isn't being unreasonable here.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. The author requires the updated vaccine, but some people don't have it. The author is concerned because whooping cough is serious for babies. The others argue that the vaccine doesn't need updating. But I know that the whooping cough vaccine is recommended to be updated every few years because immunity can wane. Not having the updated vaccine might leave the baby vulnerable. So the author's stance makes sense here too. \n\nThe other people are calling the author names and not respecting their boundaries. The author is trying to protect their child, which is a parent's responsibility. They're making choices based on health and safety, which are valid reasons. The fact that they go out of their way to avoid those people might seem harsh, but it's their right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making informed decisions to protect their baby from preventable health risks. The people criticizing them are not in the right for dismissing the author's concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
