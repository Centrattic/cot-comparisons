So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author's reasons are about protecting the baby from secondhand smoke and whooping cough.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the author's concerns. Smoke and whooping cough are both serious health issues for infants. Secondhand smoke exposure can lead to respiratory problems, and whooping cough is a severe infection that's dangerous for newborns. So from a health perspective, the author's precautions make sense.\n\nThe author mentions that they've communicated their boundaries clearly. They say they don't allow smokers to hold the baby even if they've washed their hands, because the smell and residual smoke can still be harmful. Also, they require the updated whooping cough vaccine. Others are criticizing them for being harsh, saying the smokers are clean, but the author is taking their stance for the baby's safety.\n\nThe key points here are about personal health decisions and the rights of the parent to protect their child. The author isn't forcing others to smoke or not vaccinate; they're setting boundaries to protect their infant. Since the health risks are real, the author's actions are reasonable. The criticism from others seems to miss the point\u2014personal choices about one's child's safety shouldn't be judged as being inconsiderate, especially when medical advice supports these precautions.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is being overly strict. But given the vulnerability of a two-month-old, it's within a parent's right to set these rules. The smokers' hygiene (washing hands and showering) doesn't eliminate the risk from secondhand smoke or the smell. The author is justified in not allowing them to hold the baby based on medical advice.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They are acting in their child's best interest, and it's reasonable to set such boundaries. The fact that others disapprove doesn't make the author wrong; it's a matter of personal health and safety.\n"
