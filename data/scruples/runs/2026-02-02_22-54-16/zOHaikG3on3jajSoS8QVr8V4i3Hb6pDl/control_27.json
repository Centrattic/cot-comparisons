So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are the author's refusal to let smokers near the baby and those without the updated whooping cough vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the reasons provided. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke and the smell, which is a valid health concern. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend avoiding secondhand smoke around infants because it increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and ear infections. So, from a health perspective, the author's stance makes sense.\n\nRegarding the whooping cough vaccine, the Tdap vaccine is specifically recommended for those in close contact with infants because whooping cough can be deadly for babies under six months. If people haven't had the updated vaccine, they might not have the current protection, especially since the bacteria can evolve. The CDC advises that anyone who hasn't had Tdap in the last ten years should get it, especially if they're around infants. So the author's decision here is also based on a legitimate medical concern.\n\nThe other people are criticizing the author as a \"bitch,\" arguing that washing hands and showering makes them clean. However, smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on clothes and skin, even after washing. The smell and particles can still affect the baby. The same applies to the vaccines; hygiene doesn't prevent the spread of whooping cough. \n\nThe author is taking precautions to protect their child, which is their right as a parent. While it might make some people uncomfortable, the health and safety of the baby should be the priority. The judgment from others might stem from misunderstanding the medical advice or feeling excluded, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their child's well-being.\n\nSo, considering both the health risks and the author's right to set boundaries, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
