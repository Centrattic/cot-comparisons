So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby. They mention that even if the people have washed their hands or showered, the secondhand smoke near the baby's bouncer is a concern. The author is worried about the baby's health and exposure to smoke, which is a common concern. The others are calling them a \"bitch,\" but the author's reasoning seems valid from a health perspective. The American Academy of Pediatrics does advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke, so the author's stance here is medically supported.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough vaccine. The author requires the updated vaccine, but some friends haven't gotten it. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is highly contagious and dangerous for infants, especially under six months. The AAP and CDC recommend that all caregivers get vaccinated to protect the baby. So the author's concern here is also well-founded and in line with medical guidelines.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding these people from their home, which is their right as a parent. The backlash from others labeling them as a \"bitch\" is more about social judgment than actual wrongdoing. The author's decisions are based on protecting their child's health, which is a parent's primary responsibility. The other people's hygiene (like showering daily) doesn't mitigate the risk of secondhand smoke exposure or the lack of vaccination. The author is within their rights to set these boundaries for their child's safety.\n"
