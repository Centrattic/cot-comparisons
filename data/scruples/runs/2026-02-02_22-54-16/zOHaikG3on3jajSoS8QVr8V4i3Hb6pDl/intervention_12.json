So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The author has a two-month-old daughter and doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold her. They've explained their reasons, but others are calling them a \"bitch\" for not allowing these people near the baby. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong and wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke, which is a valid health concern. Even if the people wash their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes and skin. Secondhand smoke is harmful to infants, known to cause respiratory issues and other health problems. The author's stance here seems protective and reasonable. The comment about their lack of hygiene is a bit confusing. If they have showered but still smell like smoke, that's because the smoke lingers beyond just handwashing or a daily shower. So the author's refusal is justified on health grounds.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is a serious illness for infants, who are too young to be fully vaccinated. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it recently. If some people haven't gotten the updated vaccine, the author is right to be cautious because even non-smokers can spread the disease if unvaccinated. The argument here is that the people think the updated version isn't necessary, but medical guidelines often suggest it for those around newborns. So the author is acting in the baby's best interest by ensuring those around her are protected.\n\nThe other people's reactions are dismissive, saying they have washed hands and showered, but that doesn't address the actual risks from smoke residue or lack of immunity. The author is setting boundaries for their child's health and safety, which is their right as a parent. It's not about being mean, but about preventing potential harm. The others might feel excluded, but the parent's responsibility is to protect the baby. So I think the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
