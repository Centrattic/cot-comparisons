So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing smokers or those without the updated whooping cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the author is clear about their boundaries. They don't want smokers near their baby, even if they wash their hands, because of secondhand smoke and the smell. They also require the updated whooping cough vaccine. \n\nSmoking is a known risk. Secondhand smoke is harmful to infants, increasing risks of SIDS, respiratory issues, etc. Even if someone showers, the smoke in their environment could linger. The author is protecting their child's health, which is a valid reason. The people who smoke might feel offended, but the parent's priority is the baby's safety. \n\nWhooping cough is serious for infants. The vaccine isn't 100% effective, but updating it ensures better protection. Those who don't get the updated vaccine might not realize the risk they pose. The author is taking precautions, which is responsible parenting. \n\nThe author's actions are about health and safety, not personal dislike. They're not being mean; they're setting boundaries to protect their vulnerable child. The backlash from others (\"you're a bitch\") is unfair because it's about health, not personal attacks. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. Their decisions are based on medical reasons to protect their baby. Others may not like the rules, but the parent's responsibility is to prioritize the child's well-being.\n"
