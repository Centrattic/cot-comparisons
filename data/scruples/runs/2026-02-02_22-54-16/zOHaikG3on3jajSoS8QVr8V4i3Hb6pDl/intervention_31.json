So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They've explained their reasons, but others are calling them a \"bitch\" and saying they're being too strict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The CDC and other health organizations recommend keeping infants away from smoke, even if someone has washed their hands because the chemicals can linger. So the author's concern there is valid. \n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis is a serious disease for babies, and the vaccine is updated because immunity can wane over time. If the people in question haven't had the updated vaccine, they might still be at risk of carrying the bacteria, even if they were vaccinated before. The author is taking a precaution, which is reasonable, especially since the baby is so young and their immune system isn't fully developed.\n\nNow, the pushback from others. They might feel that the author is being overly cautious or judgmental. But the author is setting boundaries for their child's health. It's their right as a parent to decide who can interact with their child, especially when it comes to health risks. The fact that the people in question don't have good hygiene (smoking near the baby's bouncer) adds another layer. \n\nThe author isn't just relying on others to tell them about their habits; they're making their own rules based on their own research and what they believe is best for their child. Others might not agree, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their baby's well-being. Also, the people being excluded aren't being asked to stop smoking or get vaccinated for themselves, but for the baby's safety. That's a parent's responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries to protect their child's health.\n"
