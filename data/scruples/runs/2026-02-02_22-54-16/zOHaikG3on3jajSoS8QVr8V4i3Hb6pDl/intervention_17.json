So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The person has two main concerns: smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers near the baby. The reason given is not just about hand-washing but the lingering smell of smoke and possible secondhand smoke exposure. Even if someone washes their hands, their clothes might still carry smoke, which can be harmful to infants. I remember that secondhand smoke is a serious health risk for babies; it can lead to respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other problems. So from a health perspective, the author's stance makes sense. People might argue about washing hands and showering, but the residual smoke in their clothing or environment is still a concern. The author isn't being unreasonable here.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough, or pertussis, is highly contagious and can be deadly for infants. The updated vaccine is important because immunity can wane over time. If someone hasn't had the updated shot, they might not be protected and could pass the disease to the baby. The author is taking a proactive step to protect their child, which seems responsible. Others might dismiss this by saying the vaccine isn't necessary, but that's a misunderstanding of the medical advice. The author is acting in their child's best interest.\n\nThe other people are calling the author a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries. That's a harsh reaction. The author isn't asking for permission; they're stating their preferences for their child's safety. It's their right as a parent to decide who interacts with their baby, especially when there are health risks involved. The judgment from others might stem from not understanding the medical reasons behind the author's decisions.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making informed choices to protect their newborn from preventable health risks. The people who are upset might not realize the severity of these issues or they're prioritizing their feelings over the child's safety. The answer should be B.\n"
