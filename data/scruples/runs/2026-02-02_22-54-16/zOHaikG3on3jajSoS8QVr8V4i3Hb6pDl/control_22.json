So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter due to smoking and lack of updated whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author has a two-month-old baby. They've made it clear they don't want smokers to hold their child, even if they've washed their hands, because of the smell and secondhand smoke. Also, they don't allow people without the updated whooping cough vaccine near the baby. The people in question are calling the author a \"bitch,\" implying they're being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for setting these boundaries. Let's break it down into parts: the smoking issue and the vaccine issue.\n\nStarting with smoking. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend that infants avoid exposure to secondhand smoke because it can lead to serious health issues, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and ear infections. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell of smoke (thirdhand smoke) can linger on their skin, hair, and clothing. Studies have shown that thirdhand smoke can still be harmful and may be ingested or inhaled by infants, especially when they're held close. So from a health perspective, the author's concern is valid. The smokers' argument about washing hands and showering doesn't address the presence of residual nicotine and other harmful chemicals that can be on their bodies and clothes. Therefore, the author's stance here seems reasonable and protective of their child's health.\n\nNext, the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine. Whooping cough is a serious disease, especially for infants. The AAP recommends that all caregivers, including anyone who will be in close contact with the baby, should have the Tdap vaccine (which includes protection against pertussis). The author is requiring the updated vaccine. If some people haven't had the updated version, they might not be protected against the current strains or have sufficient immunity. The fact that others say they don't need the update might be based on misinformation or misunderstanding. For example, maybe they got the vaccine when they were younger but the immunity has waned. The AAP's updated guidelines stress that a booster is necessary for close contacts. So the author's requirement here is in line with medical advice to protect the vulnerable infant.\n\nThe people who are being excluded are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which suggests they take offense. However, the author is setting boundaries for their child's health and safety. It's their right as a parent to decide who can interact with their child, especially when there are known health risks involved. The fact that the author is actively avoiding visiting those people's homes to prevent exposure further shows they're taking this seriously.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say that the author is being too strict or excluding people without valid reasons. However, the health risks associated with secondhand smoke and whooping cough are well-documented. The author's reasons are health-based and not arbitrary. It's not about personal dislike but protecting a vulnerable infant. The term \"bitch\" is derogatory and may reflect the other people's discomfort with being excluded, but it doesn't negate the author's right to set these boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: The author is two months postpartum, which is a time when parents are especially vigilant about their baby's health. The stress of new parenthood can heighten anxiety, and this could be contributing to their strictness. However, the concerns are legitimate and medically sound. The other people's reactions might stem from a lack of understanding about the risks or feeling personally attacked. The author's actions are defensive and protective rather than malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. Their decisions are based on health and safety for their infant, and they have the right to enforce these boundaries. The other people's reactions are dismissive of the real risks involved.\n"
