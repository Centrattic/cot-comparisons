So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting smokers or people without the updated whooping cough vaccine near their two-month-old daughter. They've explained their reasons but are getting criticized for being a \"bitch.\" I need to determine if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the health and safety aspects. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can lead to serious health issues like sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and ear problems. Even if smokers wash their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes, so the author's concern about the smell transferring to the baby is valid. Plus, if they smoke near the front door where the baby's bouncer is, that's direct exposure, which is a problem.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious respiratory disease, especially dangerous for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect against it, particularly those who will be around newborns. If people haven't had the updated vaccine, they might carry the bacteria and infect the baby, which can be life-threatening. The author's decision to avoid those who haven't been vaccinated is a precaution to protect the baby.\n\nThe author's friends or family members are criticizing them for not allowing these people near the baby. They argue about washing hands and showering daily, but those measures don't eliminate the risk from secondhand smoke or whooping cough. The author's actions are about protecting the baby's health, which is a parent's primary concern.\n\nHowever, some might say that the author is being overly cautious or excluding people without considering their circumstances. But given the medical risks, most health authorities would support avoiding secondhand smoke and ensuring vaccination status around infants. The author is making a reasonable decision based on medical advice, so they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
