So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They mentioned that some people are calling them a bitch for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke, which is a real health risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics does advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can lead to serious health issues like sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and more. So, the author's concern about smokers, even if they wash their hands, is valid because the smoke lingers on their clothes and skin. Handwashing doesn't remove the smoke particles from their body. That seems like a legitimate health precaution.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is also a significant risk to infants, especially those under six months. The CDC recommends that adults get the Tdap vaccine, which includes protection against pertussis. If some people haven't updated their vaccination against pertussis, being around a baby could pose a risk. The author is taking a proactive step to protect their child, which is understandable.\n\nThe other people involved are criticizing the author for being a \"bitch,\" but they might be missing the health implications. The author is setting boundaries to protect their vulnerable child, which is their right as a parent. It's their responsibility to ensure their child's safety, so not allowing certain people near the baby isn't about being cruel but about health and safety.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could explain the health reasons to the others to foster understanding instead of just avoiding them. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they could handle it differently. The author's actions are based on valid medical concerns, so I don't think they're in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
