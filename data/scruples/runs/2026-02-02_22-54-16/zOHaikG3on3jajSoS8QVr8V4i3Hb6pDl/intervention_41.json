So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated whooping cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They've explained their reasons, but others are calling them a bitch. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the author is setting boundaries for their baby's health. Smoking is a big concern because secondhand smoke is harmful to infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes and affect the baby. Also, the author is concerned about whooping cough, which is a serious disease for infants. The people in question don't see the issue, but the author is taking precautions.\n\nI need to consider if these boundaries are reasonable. Health and safety for a baby are top priorities. The CDC and other health organizations recommend keeping infants away from secondhand smoke and ensuring caregivers are up-to-date on vaccines, especially whooping cough (pertussis). So the author's stance aligns with medical advice. The fact that others are upset because they don't understand or respect these boundaries doesn't make the author wrong. The author is protecting their child, which is their right. The other people's reactions are dismissive, but that doesn't invalidate the author's concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
