So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting certain people hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about smokers and whooping cough vaccines.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers near their baby. They mention that secondhand smoke is a risk, even if the smokers wash their hands. The reasoning is about avoiding the smell and potential health risks. I know from health guidelines that secondhand smoke is harmful to infants, increasing risks like SIDS and respiratory issues. So, even if smokers are clean, the smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on their clothes and skin. The author's concern here seems valid from a medical standpoint.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. The author requires the updated vaccine, but some people haven't gotten it. Whooping cough is a serious disease for infants, who can't get vaccinated yet. The CDC recommends that caregivers get the Tdap vaccine to protect the baby. If others aren't vaccinated, they could unknowingly spread the disease. The author's stance here is also medically supported.\n\nThe author is facing backlash from others who think they're being too harsh because the people in question have clean hands and shower daily. But the author is prioritizing the baby's health, which is their right. The other people's hygiene doesn't address the actual risks from smoke or lack of vaccination. The author's actions are about protecting a vulnerable infant, so their decisions are reasonable.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that the author is being exclusionary or judgmental. But when it comes to a baby's health, the parents have the authority to set boundaries. The health risks are real and documented, so the author isn't being irrational. They're making informed choices based on medical advice, which is their prerogative.\n\nI think the key here is the health risks versus social opinions. The author isn't wrong to prioritize their child's safety over others' feelings. The other people's habits (smoking, not getting vaccinated) pose actual threats, so the author's refusal is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
