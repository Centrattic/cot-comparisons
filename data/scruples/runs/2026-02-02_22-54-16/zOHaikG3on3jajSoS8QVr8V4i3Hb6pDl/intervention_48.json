So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke and the risk of whooping cough. Both are valid health concerns. Smoking near the baby can cause respiratory issues and exposure to harmful chemicals. Whooping cough is a serious disease that can be life-threatening for infants, so ensuring that caregivers are vaccinated is a responsible measure.\n\nThe author's reasons are based on protecting their child's health. Even if others argue that washing hands or showering is sufficient, secondhand smoke can linger on clothing and in the environment, not just on hands. The vaccine requirement is also about preventing a potentially deadly disease, which is a well-supported medical recommendation.\n\nSome might argue that the author is being too strict or judgmental, but the parent's primary responsibility is to protect their child. It's reasonable to set boundaries regarding who can be around the baby, especially when there are clear health risks involved. The people being excluded are smokers or unvaccinated, which are preventable risks that the parent has the right to mitigate.\n\nIn terms of social judgment, others calling the author a \"bitch\" for these decisions might stem from a lack of understanding or personal biases. However, the parent's decisions are in the best interest of the child. It's about prioritizing health and safety over social expectations.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
