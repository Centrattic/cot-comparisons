So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a new parent who's setting boundaries about who can hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are:\n\n1. They don't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands, because of secondhand smoke exposure and the lingering smell. They also mention that these smokers have poor hygiene, so they avoid their houses.\n2. They don't allow people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby.\n\nOthers are calling the author a \"bitch\" for these decisions, so the author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if these boundaries are reasonable. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend no exposure to secondhand smoke for babies. So, the author's concern is valid from a health perspective. Even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and skin, which could be harmful or uncomfortable for the baby. The author's insistence on avoiding this is a protective measure, which is reasonable.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine (pertussis), the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in contact with infants. Whooping Cough can be severe in babies, so the author is taking a precautionary step. Even if some friends think it's unnecessary, the author is prioritizing their child's safety, which is understandable.\n\nThe author is also setting boundaries about not allowing these people into their home or visiting the others' homes. This is their right as a parent. People often have strong reactions when their habits are criticized, even if the parent's concerns are valid. The friends' reactions might stem from feeling judged, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong in their stance.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author is making decisions for their child, and while they have the right to do so, it's important that they communicate these boundaries clearly and respectfully. The key point is whether the author's actions are reasonable and in the best interest of their child. Given the health risks associated with secondhand smoke and Whooping Cough, the author's actions seem justified. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
