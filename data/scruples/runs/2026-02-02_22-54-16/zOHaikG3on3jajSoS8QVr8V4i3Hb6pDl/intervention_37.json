So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They've explained their reasons, but others are calling them a \"bitch\" for not allowing these people near the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety concerns. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations advise against exposing babies to secondhand smoke because it can lead to serious health issues like respiratory infections, ear infections, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). So, the author's concern there is valid from a medical standpoint.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis, or Whooping Cough, is particularly dangerous for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults, especially those who will be around babies, to prevent spreading the disease. If someone hasn't updated their vaccine, they could be a risk. The author is being cautious, which is understandable given how contagious and severe pertussis can be in babies.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child, which is a parent's right. The fact that others are upset and calling them names suggests that they might not understand the severity of the risks involved. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their child's health. The other people's hygiene (like washing hands and showering) doesn't mitigate the risks posed by smoking or lack of vaccination. Handwashing and showers don't eliminate secondhand smoke particles or bacteria from pertussis, so those arguments from the others aren't valid in this context.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal choice. Parents have the right to decide who can interact with their children, especially when it comes to health precautions. The author isn't being discriminatory in a broader sense; they're making specific health-related decisions based on medical advice. The term \"bitch\" is a harsh reaction that doesn't address the actual health concerns.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're making responsible choices to protect their infant from known health risks. The criticism from others is misplaced, and the author's actions are justified.\n"
