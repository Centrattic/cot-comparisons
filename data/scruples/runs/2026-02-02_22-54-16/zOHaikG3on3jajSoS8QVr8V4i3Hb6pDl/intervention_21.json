So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are not allowing smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: they don't want their baby exposed to secondhand smoke and want to avoid the smell. Smoking is a known health hazard for infants, even if the smokers wash their hands. Secondhand smoke can linger in clothes and the environment, increasing risks like SIDS and respiratory issues. So, the author's stance here seems medically sound.\n\nThen there's the vaccine part. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is extremely dangerous for infants. The vaccine isn't lifelong; immunity wanes over time, so boosters are recommended. If people haven't had the updated vaccine, they could be carriers without knowing. The author is taking a precaution, which is logical given the severity of pertussis in newborns.\n\nThe author mentions that others are calling them a \"bitch,\" but that's a social reaction, not a legal or moral one. The parents have the right to protect their child's health. The other people's hygiene habits don't directly affect the baby's safety in the same way as smoking or vaccination status. So the author's decisions are based on valid health concerns, not just personal dislike.\n\nPossible counterarguments: some might say it's exclusionary, but when it comes to a child's health, parents are generally encouraged to take necessary precautions. The other people's actions (smoking, not updating vaccines) are personal choices, but the author is choosing to limit exposure to protect their baby. That's a parent's prerogative, especially when public health guidelines support such precautions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting in their child's best interest based on medical advice and health risks. The answer should be B.\n"
