So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The two main reasons given are not wanting smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands, and not allowing those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful, especially for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, strongly advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can lead to respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other problems. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and skin. So the author's concern there is valid from a health perspective.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is a serious disease for infants, and the vaccine's protection wanes over time. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults, especially those who will be around infants. The AAP and CDC both emphasize that close contacts should be up to date with their vaccines to protect the baby. So if some people haven't had the updated vaccine, the author has a legitimate reason to be cautious.\n\nThe other people are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which seems unfair. The author is making decisions based on their child's health and well-being, which is their right as a parent. The fact that others aren't following through on washing their hands properly is another issue, but the author is taking steps to protect their child from potential harm. \n\nIt also seems like the author is being proactive and specific about their boundaries, which is reasonable. People might not like the restrictions, but the parent's priority is their child's safety. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable beyond what medical advice recommends. So, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
