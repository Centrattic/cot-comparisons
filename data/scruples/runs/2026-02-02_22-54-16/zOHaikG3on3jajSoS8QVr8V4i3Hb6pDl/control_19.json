So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the new parent not wanting smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the reasons given. The parent doesn't want smokers to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke exposure, even if they've washed their hands. They mention the smell and proximity to the baby's bouncer. Also, they require the updated Whooping Cough vaccine for anyone near the baby.\n\nThe other people are calling the parent a \"bitch\" and arguing that washing hands and showering is enough. The parent avoids having these people over or visiting them. \n\nNow, to determine if the parent is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom a health perspective, secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations advise against secondhand smoke exposure for babies because it can lead to respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other problems. So, the parent's concern here is valid and supported by medical evidence.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine (Tdap), pertussis is particularly dangerous for infants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone in close contact with a newborn get the Tdap vaccine, ideally during each pregnancy. If the people in question haven't had the updated vaccine, they could pose a risk, even if they have other vaccines. The parent is following medical advice to protect the baby from preventable diseases.\n\nThe parent is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. While it's understandable that others might feel offended, the parent's actions are based on medical recommendations. The fact that the smokers shower and wash their hands doesn't eliminate the risk of secondhand smoke, which lingers in the environment and on clothing. Similarly, not having the updated vaccine is a medical risk regardless of other hygiene practices.\n\nHowever, the parent is excluding people from their social circle, which might cause tension. But the health and safety of the baby should be the top priority. The parent is not being unreasonable; they are making informed decisions to protect their child. The other people's reactions (calling the parent names) suggest they might not be considering the actual risks involved.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the parent is not. They have a legitimate reason based on medical advice. The other people might need to respect these boundaries even if they don't agree. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
