So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves not allowing smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the author\u4e0d\u8ba9 smokers hold their baby. The reason given is the smell of smoke and potential secondhand smoke exposure. They mention that even if smokers wash their hands, they still want to avoid the smell on the baby or their clothes. Also, they don't want smokers near the baby's bouncer because they smoke by the door. People are calling them a bitch for this.\n\nThen there's the vaccination part: the author doesn't allow anyone without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby. Some people argue that the vaccine isn't necessary. The author is strict about this.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider public health guidelines. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, leading to respiratory issues and other health problems. Even if smokers shower and wash hands, the smell (thirdhand smoke) can linger on clothes and skin, which is harmful. So the author's stance on smoking is supported by health experts.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, pertussis is a serious disease for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect babies, especially since infants can't get vaccinated until they are a few months old. The author is requiring the updated vaccine, which is a precaution. Those who argue against it might be misunderstanding the necessity.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. While some might find it harsh, these measures are medically sound. The people being excluded are smokers and unvaccinated individuals. The author isn't being discriminatory but is prioritizing their child's well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
