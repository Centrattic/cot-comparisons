      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a new parent, their daughter is two months old. They don't want smokers to hold their baby, even if they've washed their hands. The reason given is to prevent the baby from smelling like smoke, which could transfer to the baby's clothes or expose her to secondhand smoke. The smokers in question are near the baby's bouncer by the front door, and others are calling the author a \"bitch\" for not allowing them near the baby. Also, the author doesn't let people near the baby if they haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Some people argue that the vaccine isn't necessary to update, so they don't get it.\n\nFirst, let's break down the two main issues: smoking and vaccination. \n\nStarting with the smoking issue. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, recommends that infants avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their skin, hair, and clothes. So the author is trying to protect their baby from that exposure. The smokers are smoking near the baby's bouncer, which is even worse because it's close to where the baby is. The author's stance seems medically supported here.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis (whooping cough) is a serious illness for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't been vaccinated recently, especially those in close contact with babies. The author is requiring the updated vaccine, which is a preventive measure. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, they might be at risk of carrying the bacteria, so keeping them away reduces the baby's risk. The people say they don't need the update, but medical guidelines suggest otherwise. For example, the CDC recommends a Tdap booster for adults, especially if they'll be around infants.\n\nSo from a health and safety perspective, the author is taking reasonable precautions. The people criticizing the author are smokers and unvaccinated individuals who might not be aware of the risks or are ignoring the advice of health professionals. The author is defending their child's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nBut some might argue that the author is being too strict or not accommodating. However, when it comes to a newborn's health, parents are within their rights to set boundaries to protect their child. The criticism from the others (\"you're a bitch\") seems unwarranted if their actions are indeed harmful to the baby. The author isn't forcing anyone to come into contact with their child; they're simply setting clear boundaries based on medical advice.\n\nI need to consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could explain the health reasons more clearly. But the core issue is that the author is prioritizing their child's safety, which is a valid and responsible stance. The other people's arguments about hygiene and not needing the vaccine might not be based on current medical understanding. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries.\n"
