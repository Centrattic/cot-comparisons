So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are not wanting smokers to hold the baby and requiring the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The author doesn't want smokers to hold their baby because of secondhand smoke and the smell. The smokers argue they wash their hands and shower daily, so they don't see why it's a problem. But secondhand smoke isn't just about direct exposure when holding the baby. Even if someone washes their hands, their clothes can carry the smell and toxins. Studies show that thirdhand smoke (residual nicotine and other chemicals on surfaces) can be harmful, especially to infants. So the author's concern might be valid from a health standpoint.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is highly contagious and dangerous for infants. The updated vaccine is recommended because immunity wanes over time, and the acellular vaccine is more effective. If someone hasn't updated their vaccine, they could be a risk. The author is right to be cautious here since even a small risk could be deadly for a newborn.\n\nThe other people are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is harsh. The author is setting boundaries for their child's safety. While it's true that they're excluding people, the reasons are health-related and not based on personal dislike. The smokers' argument about hygiene (washing hands and showering) doesn't address the actual risk of secondhand smoke. Similarly, the vaccine requirement is a public health measure, not just a personal preference.\n\nSo, considering the health risks involved, the author is protecting their child from preventable dangers. The other people's reactions seem dismissive of actual health concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
