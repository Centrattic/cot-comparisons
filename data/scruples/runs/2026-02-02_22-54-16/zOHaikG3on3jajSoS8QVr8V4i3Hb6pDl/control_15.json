So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. The person explains their reasons: not wanting secondhand smoke exposure and preventing the spread of whooping cough. However, other people are calling them a \"bitch\" for these decisions.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the reasons given. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease that can be particularly dangerous for infants. The CDC recommends that all adults close to infants get the Tdap vaccine, which includes protection against pertussis. So, the parent's stance on the vaccine is medically sound. They're protecting their child from a preventable illness, which is a responsible action.\n\nRegarding the smokers, even if they wash their hands, secondhand smoke can linger on their clothes and skin. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and ear infections. The parent is justified in wanting to avoid this exposure, even if it means limiting visitors. \n\nThe other people's reaction, calling the parent a \"bitch,\" is more about their own feelings about being excluded rather than the parent's right to protect their child. It's important to consider that parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health and safety, especially when there are medical guidelines supporting their choices.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent is acting in their child's best interest based on medical advice. They're not being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their baby's health. The other people's judgment doesn't negate the parent's right to make these decisions. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
