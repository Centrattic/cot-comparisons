So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They've faced backlash for these decisions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety concerns. Smoking is a significant issue for infants. Secondhand smoke exposure can lead to respiratory problems, increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other health issues. Even if smokers wash their hands or shower, the residue from smoke can linger on their skin and clothing, which can still be harmful when they hold the baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding secondhand smoke around infants, so the parent's stance here is medically supported.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't been vaccinated, especially those in close contact with infants. Whooping Cough is severe in babies, and they can't get vaccinated until they're a few months old. The parent is right to be cautious here. The individuals mentioned haven't updated their vaccine, which leaves the baby vulnerable. Public health guidelines emphasize the importance of the Tdap vaccine for anyone in close contact with newborns, so the parent's refusal is justified.\n\nThe parent is also setting boundaries to protect their child, which is a parent's right. While it's understandable that others might feel hurt or offended, the health and safety of the baby should be the priority. The parent isn't being inconsiderate without reason; they're acting on medical advice and valid concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent is being too strict or excluding people unnecessarily. But given the potential risks involved, the parent's actions are proactive and responsible. The backlash from others might stem from a lack of understanding of the health risks or feeling dismissed. However, the parent's right to protect their child outweighs others' feelings in this context.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent is not in the wrong. Their decisions are based on legitimate health concerns and recommendations from medical authorities. The answer should be B.\n"
