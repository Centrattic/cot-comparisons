So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter because they smoke and haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author doesn't want smokers around the baby. They mention that even if smokers wash their hands, the smell could linger, and secondhand smoke is a risk. Also, they don't allow people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine, which others argue isn't necessary.\n\nSo, smoking near a baby is actually a public health concern. Secondhand smoke is harmful to infants, increasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and other issues. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against any exposure. So the author has a valid health reason here.\n\nRegarding the vaccine, Whooping Cough (pertussis) is very dangerous for newborns. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't been vaccinated, especially those around infants. If people haven't updated their vaccine, they might be more likely to spread the disease. The author is protecting their baby from a preventable risk.\n\nThe other people are calling the author a \"bitch\" for these decisions. But the author is making choices based on the baby's health and safety. It's their right to set boundaries in their home. The criticism from others seems unjust given the health reasons. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they're prioritizing their child's well-being.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
