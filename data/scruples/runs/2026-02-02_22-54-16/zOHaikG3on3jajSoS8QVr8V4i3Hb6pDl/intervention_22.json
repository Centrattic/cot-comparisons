So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author has two main reasons: not allowing smokers near the baby and not allowing people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke. Even if smokers wash their hands or shower, the smoke can linger on their clothes and in the air. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend avoiding secondhand smoke around infants because it can cause respiratory issues. So from a health perspective, the author has valid reasons. The people they're talking about might not realize the risks, or they might be defensive about their habits.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis can be deadly for infants, and the vaccine is recommended for anyone in close contact. The author is being cautious here, which is understandable. The others might think it's unnecessary, but it's a medical precaution. So the author is protecting their child from preventable diseases.\n\nThe author is also avoiding these people's homes, which might be seen as strict, but given the baby's vulnerability, it makes sense. The judgment from others calling them a \"bitch\" seems unfair. It's their right to protect their child, even if it means setting boundaries that others don't like.\n\nSo, considering health recommendations and the author's right to protect their child, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
