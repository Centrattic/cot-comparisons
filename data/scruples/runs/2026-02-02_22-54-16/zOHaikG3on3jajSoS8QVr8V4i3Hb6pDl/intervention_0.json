So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author has two main reasons: not allowing smokers near the baby and requiring the Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. Even if the people smoke a pack a day and then wash their hands or shower, there's still residual nicotine and toxins on their skin, hair, and clothes. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants, and thirdhand smoke (residue from smoke) can be harmful too. The CDC and other health organizations recommend keeping babies away from smoke, including thirdhand. So, the author's stance here is based on valid health concerns.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious illness, especially for infants who can't be vaccinated yet. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults to protect against this. If some people haven't had the updated vaccine, even if they have other vaccines, they could be a risk. The author's requirement for the Tdap is supported by medical guidelines to prevent the spread of the disease to vulnerable babies.\n\nNow, the reactions from others. The people in question are calling the author a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries. That's a strong reaction, but the author is asserting their right to protect their child. It's understandable that some might feel personally attacked, but the health of the baby is a primary concern.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points are health and safety. The author isn't being cruel or unreasonable; they're making informed decisions based on medical advice. The people not meeting these criteria aren't in a position to criticize the author's parenting choices, especially when public health guidelines support the author's stance.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking reasonable precautions to protect their child, which is a parent's responsibility. The answer should be B.\n"
