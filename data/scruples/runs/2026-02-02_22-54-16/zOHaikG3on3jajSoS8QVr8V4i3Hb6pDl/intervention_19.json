So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old. They mentioned that smokers smoke a pack a day and even though they wash hands and shower, the author still doesn't want them near the baby. Also, they don't allow people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Others are calling them a bitch.\n\nFirst, secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics says it's dangerous and can cause respiratory issues, SIDS, etc. Even if someone washes hands, the smell and particles can linger. So the author's concern is valid. Also, the Whooping Cough vaccine is important for infants since the disease can be severe. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to get the updated version, especially when around babies. So the author is following medical advice here.\n\nBut some people might think it's being too strict or not trusting others, but given the health risks, the author is acting in the baby's best interest. They're not being cruel, just setting boundaries for health reasons. So the answer should be B.\n"
