So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong regarding not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The two main reasons given are not allowing smokers to hold her and not allowing people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. For newborns, exposure to secondhand smoke is a serious concern. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations warn that even trace amounts of smoke can be harmful because infants have developing respiratory systems. The author is concerned about the smell and secondhand smoke, which is a valid health precaution. So, from a medical standpoint, not allowing smokers near the baby makes sense.\n\nThen there's the vaccine issue. Whooping Cough, or pertussis, is a highly contagious disease that can be dangerous for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect their babies, especially since the immunity from the initial vaccine wears off. The author is being cautious by requiring the updated vaccine, which is a common practice among health-conscious parents. The people they mention haven't updated their vaccine, which could put the baby at risk.\n\nThe author mentions that others are calling them a \"bitch\" for these decisions. But is that a fair reaction? The right to set boundaries for your child's health is generally accepted. Parents often have specific rules about who can interact with their children, especially when health is a factor. While it's possible that some might feel excluded or offended, the author's primary responsibility is to protect their infant.\n\nHygiene is another point. The author is concerned that smokers might not wash their hands properly or that the smell lingers. Even if someone showers and washes hands, smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can remain on clothes and skin, which the baby could be exposed to. So the author's stance isn't just about their actions but the residual effects.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are unreasonable. Health precautions for infants are widely supported, so requiring non-smoking and updated vaccines isn't overstepping. The author is not forcing others to get vaccinated or quit smoking; they're just setting boundaries for their own child's safety. The other people are free to hold the baby if they comply with these conditions, but the author has every right to enforce them without being judged negatively.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They are prioritizing their child's health and safety, which is a parent's right. The criticism from others is unwarranted in this context.\n"
