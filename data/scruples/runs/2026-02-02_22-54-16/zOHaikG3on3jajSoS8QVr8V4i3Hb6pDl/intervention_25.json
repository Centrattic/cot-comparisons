So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves not allowing smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author explains their reasons, but others are calling them a bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of a newborn. Smoking is definitely harmful. Secondhand smoke is dangerous for infants, increasing the risk of SIDS, respiratory issues, etc. Even if smokers wash their hands, the smell can linger and the smoke near the front door where the baby's bouncer is placed is a risk. So, the author's stance on not allowing smokers seems reasonable from a health perspective.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants. The vaccine's effectiveness decreases over time, so an updated shot is recommended for anyone in close contact with a baby. If the people the author is excluding haven't had the updated vaccine, that's a valid concern. Whooping Cough can be deadly for newborns because their immune systems are not strong enough to fight it.\n\nThe author is making choices to protect their child, which is their right as a parent. The other people's reactions, calling the author a bitch, might stem from not understanding the severity of the health risks. But the author isn't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing their child's safety. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether their decisions are justified. Since both the smoking and vaccination issues are valid health concerns for infants, and the author is communicating their boundaries clearly, it seems they're acting in their child's best interest. The disapproval from others doesn't negate the author's right to set these safety measures. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
