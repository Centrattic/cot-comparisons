So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong regarding allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are:\n\n1. The author doesn't want smokers (about a pack a day) to hold their baby, even if they wash their hands. The reasoning is avoiding the smell of smoke on the baby and secondhand smoke exposure, noting that the smokers are near the baby's bouncer at the front door.\n2. They also don't allow people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby. Some people argue they don't need the update, but the author is strict about it.\n3. Others are calling the author a \"bitch\" for these restrictions, suggesting that washing hands and showering daily should be enough.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are reasonable. Secondhand smoke is a significant health risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend avoiding secondhand smoke around babies because it can cause respiratory issues, SIDS, and other problems. So, the author's concern about the smell isn't just about odor but actual health risks. Even if the smokers wash their hands, the risk isn't eliminated because smoke particles can linger on clothing and skin, transferring to the baby. So, the author's stance there seems justified.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine, it's especially important for infants who are too young to be vaccinated. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect against pertussis, and getting it updated is crucial for those around the baby. Whooping Cough can be life-threatening for newborns. So, the author's requirement for the updated vaccine is also a reasonable precaution.\n\nThe backlash from others calling the author a \"bitch\" seems unjustified because they're making health-conscious decisions. The smokers' argument about washing hands and showering doesn't address the actual risks. The author is prioritizing the baby's health, which is their right as a parent. The fact that the smokers lack hygiene (as per the author's note) adds another layer, but even if they were clean, the secondhand smoke risk remains.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, parents have the right to set boundaries to protect their children's health. While social relationships might be affected, the health and safety of the infant should be the priority. The author isn't being inconsiderate without reason; they have valid medical concerns supported by health guidelines.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Their actions are based on protecting their child from preventable health risks. The answer should be B.\n"
