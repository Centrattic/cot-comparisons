So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are the restrictions on smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author doesn't want smokers around the baby because of secondhand smoke, which I know can be harmful. Even if they wash their hands, the smell and the smoke near the baby's area could still pose risks. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants, increasing the risk of respiratory issues and other problems. So, from a health perspective, the author's concerns are valid.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis is a serious illness for newborns, who can't get vaccinated until 2 months old. Adults who haven't had a Tdap booster can still be carriers. The author is requiring the updated vaccine, but some people argue it's unnecessary. However, medical guidelines typically recommend the pertussis booster for close contacts of infants. So here, the author is acting on medical advice, which is responsible.\n\nNow, the backlash mentioned: people calling the author a \"bitch\" for these decisions. That's a problem. Dismissing someone's health concerns as being inconsiderate undermines their right to make choices about their child's safety. The author's boundaries are about their child's health, not about the other people's habits. It's their right to set these limits, especially for a vulnerable infant.\n\nAre the restrictions reasonable? Yes. Smoking around a baby is dangerous, and not getting the pertussis vaccine puts the baby at risk. The author isn't banning people outright but setting clear boundaries to protect the child. They are prioritizing health over social interactions, which is a parent's role.\n\nPossible counterarguments: some might say the author is being too strict, but the key is the baby's safety. The author isn't being cruel; they're making health-focused decisions. The people in question might not realize the severity of the risks involved.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making informed decisions to protect their child, and the criticism they're facing is unwarranted. The answer should be B.\n"
