So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are avoiding secondhand smoke exposure and the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the baby's health is the main concern here. The parent doesn't want smokers to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke. Even if they wash their hands, the smell might linger, and there's the health risk. The parent also requires the whooping cough vaccine, which some people haven't updated. \n\nI need to consider medical guidelines. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. It can cause respiratory issues and other health problems. So, the parent's stance on that is well-founded. As for the whooping cough vaccine, the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in contact with infants. The parent's requirement aligns with medical advice to protect the baby from pertussis, which can be severe in infants.\n\nThe friends are calling the parent a \"bitch,\" but that's their reaction. The parent is setting boundaries based on health concerns. It's their right to protect their child. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
