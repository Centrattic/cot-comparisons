So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter due to smoking and lack of whooping cough vaccination. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about secondhand smoke and the smell. They mention that the people in question smoke a pack a day, even if they wash their hands. The author's reasoning is about protecting their child from the smell and potential health risks from secondhand smoke. They also don't allow people without the updated whooping cough vaccine near the baby. Others are calling them a \"bitch,\" but the author is avoiding these people.\n\nNow, I need to consider the health aspects. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants. It can lead to respiratory issues, SIDS, and other problems. The AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) does recommend avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke for infants. So from a health standpoint, the author's concern is valid. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes and hair, which the baby could inhale. So the author's stance on not allowing smokers near the baby seems reasonable.\n\nRegarding the whooping cough vaccine, pertussis is a serious illness in infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in close contact with babies. The author is being cautious by requiring the updated vaccine, which is a common precaution. Those who haven't had it might not see the necessity, but the author's priority is protecting their vulnerable child.\n\nThe other people's reactions, calling them a bitch, seem harsh. The author is making decisions based on their child's health and safety, which is a parent's right. The fact that they're avoiding these people entirely is understandable given the risks. The people they're excluding are smokers who might not consider the full impact of their habit on the baby, and those who aren't vaccinated against a preventable disease.\n\nHowever, I should also consider social dynamics. The author might be cutting off friends or family, which can cause tension. But health and safety are paramount for a newborn. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're setting clear boundaries for their child's well-being. The other people's hygiene (showering daily) isn't relevant to the secondhand smoke issue. The smell from smoke is more about airborne particles and lingering on fabrics, not just hand hygiene.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is acting in their child's best interest based on medical advice and health concerns. They are not in the wrong for setting these boundaries, even if others find it harsh. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
