So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are avoiding smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, causing respiratory issues and other health problems. Even if the smokers wash their hands or shower, the smell can linger, and there might be residual nicotine or toxins on their clothes or skin that could affect the baby. So the author's concern there seems valid.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, pertussis is highly contagious and dangerous for newborns. The vaccine's protection wanes over time, so updates are recommended, especially for those in close contact with infants. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccine, they could be a risk. The author's stance here is also about protecting the baby from preventable illness.\n\nThe author is taking proactive steps to ensure their child's safety. They have a right to set boundaries around who can interact with their infant. The fact that others are calling them a \"bitch\" might reflect their own discomfort with the restrictions, but the author's primary responsibility is to their child. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any cultural or social norm that might influence this. In some contexts, people might expect more lenience, but health guidelines clearly support avoiding secondhand smoke and ensuring up-to-date vaccinations for those around infants. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable; they're making informed decisions based on medical advice. The people they're excluding are choosing to smoke and not get vaccinated, which puts the baby at risk regardless of their hygiene. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are protective and reasonable given the risks involved. The answer should be B.\n"
