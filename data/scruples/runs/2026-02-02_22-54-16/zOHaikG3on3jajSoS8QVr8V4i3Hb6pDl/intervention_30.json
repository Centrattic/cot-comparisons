So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves them not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about not allowing smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is definitely a risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding secondhand smoke around babies because it can lead to respiratory issues, SIDS, and other problems. So, the author's concern about smokers is valid medically.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine. Pertussis is very dangerous for infants, and the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect them. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, they might not be protected and could transmit the disease to the baby. The author is being cautious here, which is reasonable.\n\nThe people involved are calling the author a \"bitch\" for these decisions. But the author is prioritizing their baby's health. Medical advice supports avoiding exposure to known risks. The author isn't being unkind; they're setting boundaries based on health concerns.\n\nThe smokers washing their hands and showering daily might not remove the residual nicotine and toxins from their hair and clothes, which can still affect the baby. So the author's refusal isn't just about hand hygiene. This is a common point of misunderstanding, where people think washing hands is enough, but the actual risk is more about environmental exposure.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, people might feel personally attacked, but the author's actions are about protecting their child. It's their right to make decisions for their baby's well-being, even if others don't agree. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're acting in the baby's best interest based on medical advice.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decisions are supported by health guidelines, and they're prioritizing their child's safety. The answer should be B.\n"
