So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are not wanting smokers around the baby and requiring the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke exposure. Even if smokers wash their hands, there's still the risk of residual smoke particles on their clothes and in the air. Health guidelines do recommend keeping infants away from secondhand smoke because it's harmful. So from a health perspective, the author has a valid reason here.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough can be very dangerous for infants, even deadly. The updated vaccine is recommended for those who will be in close contact with a baby. If some people haven't gotten the updated vaccine, it's a risk they're taking. The author's stance here is about protecting their child's health, which makes sense.\n\nThe people in question are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which seems harsh. They argue that washing hands and showering daily is enough, but hygiene isn't just about hands. Smoke lingers on clothing and in the environment. The vaccine isn't a daily thing; it's a medical decision. So the author's concerns are about factors beyond simple hygiene.\n\nThe author is taking steps to protect their child, which is a parent's right. They're not being unreasonable by setting boundaries for their child's health. The response from others seems dismissive of legitimate health risks. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
