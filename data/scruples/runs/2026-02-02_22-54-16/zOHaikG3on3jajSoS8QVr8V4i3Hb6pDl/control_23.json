So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about disallowing smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health implications. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, causing respiratory issues and other health problems. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against any exposure to secondhand smoke for babies. So the author's stance on this seems medically justified.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine. The updated vaccine is important because pertussis is highly contagious and can be deadly for infants. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in contact with babies. If some people haven't updated their vaccination, that's a risk. The author's decision to not allow them near the baby is a preventive measure against a serious disease.\n\nThe people in question are arguing that washing hands and showering daily is enough, but the issue isn't about hand hygiene. For secondhand smoke, even washed hands don't remove the residual smoke particles that can linger on clothes and skin. Similarly, vaccines are a personal choice, but when it comes to protecting a vulnerable infant, the decision shifts to the parent's responsibility to minimize risks.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal boundaries. As a parent, the author has the right to set boundaries to protect their child's health. Others might feel criticized, but the author isn't being cruel; they're prioritizing their baby's safety. The term \"bitch\" used by others is a derogatory response and doesn't validate their actions.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's decisions are based on valid health concerns. The people being excluded are making choices that pose risks to the infant, and the author isn't in the wrong for taking precautions. Medical guidelines support avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke and ensuring up-to-date vaccinations for those in contact with babies. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
