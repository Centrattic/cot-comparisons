So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands. They mention that smokers smoke a pack a day, and the smoke is near the baby's bouncer. The author is worried about the baby smelling smoke and the health risks of secondhand smoke. The other people are calling the author a \"bitch\" because they wash their hands and shower daily. But the author is avoiding their presence to keep the baby safe.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine issue. The author requires the updated vaccine, but some people don't have it because they think it's not necessary. The author is concerned about the baby's health, as Whooping Cough can be very dangerous for infants.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong here. From a health perspective, secondhand smoke is harmful to infants and can cause serious health issues, including respiratory problems. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. So, the author's concern is valid. \n\nRegarding the vaccine, Whooping Cough (pertussis) is highly contagious and can be life-threatening for newborns. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to get a booster, especially those in close contact with infants. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccines, they could be a risk even if they think it's unnecessary. \n\nThe author is making decisions to protect their child's health, which is a parent's responsibility. The friends or family members might feel hurt or offended, but the parent's primary duty is to the child's wellbeing. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're taking precautions based on medical advice. \n\nThe response from others calling the author names is dismissive of the valid health concerns. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their baby. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
