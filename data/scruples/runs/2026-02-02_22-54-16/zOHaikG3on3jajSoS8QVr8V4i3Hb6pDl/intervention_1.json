So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not allowing certain people near their two-month-old daughter. The author has two main reasons: not allowing smokers near the baby and requiring the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The author explains that even if smokers wash their hands, they don't want the baby to be exposed to secondhand smoke or the smell. They also mention that these people smoke near the baby's bouncer by the front door. The other people argue that since they shower and wash hands, it's okay. But from a health perspective, secondhand smoke is harmful. The American Lung Association and WHO both say that secondhand smoke can cause serious health issues in infants, like SIDS, respiratory infections, and more. So, the author is protecting their child from known dangers. The others might be dismissive, but that doesn't make the author wrong.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants. The CDC recommends the Tdap vaccine for adults who haven't had it, especially those around babies. If some people haven't updated their vaccine, they're at higher risk of carrying the bacteria. The author is prioritizing their baby's safety here. The people who haven't gotten the vaccine might not realize the risk, but the author has a right to set boundaries for their child's health.\n\nThe author also mentions actively avoiding these people in their homes. While it's a social choice, it's their home and they have the right to set rules, especially for a vulnerable infant. The criticism that they're a \"bitch\" is more about social judgment than health. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're taking proactive steps to protect their baby from preventable risks. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. Their actions are based on valid health concerns, and they have the right to enforce these rules to protect their child. The answer should be B.\n"
