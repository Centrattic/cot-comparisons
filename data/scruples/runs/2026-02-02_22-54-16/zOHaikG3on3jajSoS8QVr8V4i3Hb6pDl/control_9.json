So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The situation involves their two-month-old daughter and certain people they don't want to hold her. The main issues are smoking and the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby. They mentioned that even if smokers wash their hands, they still don't want the baby to be around secondhand smoke or smell it. The smokers are washing their hands and showering daily, but the author is concerned about the smoke near the front door and on their clothes. \n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. The author requires people to have the updated vaccine, but some argue it's not necessary. Whooping cough can be really dangerous for infants, so that's a valid health concern. \n\nNow, considering the responses from others calling the author a \"bitch,\" is that justified? Well, as a parent, protecting the baby's health is a top priority. Secondhand smoke is linked to various health issues in infants, including respiratory problems. The American Academy of Pediatrics does advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. So the author's stance on not allowing smokers near the baby is medically supported.\n\nRegarding the vaccine, whooping cough (pertussis) is highly contagious and can be deadly for newborns. The updated vaccine is recommended for those in close contact with infants. If some people haven't been updated, the author is right to be cautious. \n\nThe other people's arguments about washing hands and showering don't address the actual risk of secondhand smoke or lack of vaccination. Just because they're clean doesn't mean they're not carrying pathogens or smoke particles. \n\nSo, the author is acting in their child's best interest based on medical advice. The others are dismissing valid health concerns, which isn't appropriate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
