So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author has two main reasons: not allowing smokers near the baby and requiring the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about secondhand smoke. Even if smokers wash their hands, the smell could linger on their clothes and be transferred to the baby. The author also mentions that these people smoke near the front door where the baby's bouncer is. From a health perspective, secondhand smoke is dangerous for infants, known to cause respiratory issues and other problems. The CDC and other health organizations recommend keeping infants away from smoke, including on clothing. So, the author's stance seems medically sound here. The fact that others are calling them a \"bitch\" might be more about social judgment than health concerns.\n\nSecond, the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis is extremely dangerous for newborns, who can't get vaccinated until they're older. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults to protect against pertussis. If the author's friends haven't had the updated vaccine, they could be a risk. The CDC recommends that all family members get the Tdap before meeting the baby. So, requiring the vaccine is a protective measure, even if the friends think it's unnecessary. \n\nThe author is making choices based on protecting their baby's health. While others might feel excluded or offended, the priority here is the infant's well-being. The author isn't being inconsiderate without reason. They have valid medical justifications. The friends' reactions seem to stem from misunderstanding or not taking the risks seriously. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's possible that the author's friends might feel slighted, but the author isn't obligated to let people hold their baby if they pose a health risk. It's a personal choice and a parent's right to set boundaries for their child's safety. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decisions are rooted in protecting their child from preventable health hazards. The answer should be B.\n"
