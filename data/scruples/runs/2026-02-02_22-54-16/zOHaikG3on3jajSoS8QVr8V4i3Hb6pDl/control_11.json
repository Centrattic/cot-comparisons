So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The situation involves them not wanting smokers or people without updated whooping cough vaccines to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The author doesn't want smokers to hold their baby because of the smell and secondhand smoke. Even if the smokers wash their hands or shower, the author is concerned about the residual smoke smell. I remember that thirdhand smoke is a thing, where the chemicals from smoke cling to clothes and skin. So even if someone showers, their clothes might still carry the smell. Also, secondhand smoke is a real health risk for infants, which can lead to respiratory issues. So the author's concern here seems valid.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Pertussis is a serious disease for infants, especially under six months old. The vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it recently because immunity can wane over time. If the author's friends refuse to get the updated vaccine, they could be putting the baby at risk. Whooping cough can be fatal for babies, so the author's caution makes sense.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding these people in their home. The friends are calling the author a \"bitch,\" but the author's reasons are health-related. It's about protecting a vulnerable infant. The friends seem to be dismissing valid health concerns. So, the author isn't being unreasonable; they're taking reasonable precautions for their child's safety.\n\nI don't see any evidence that the author is overreacting. Both concerns are medically supported. The friends' reactions are probably defensive because their habits are being challenged, but the author's stance is about health and safety. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
