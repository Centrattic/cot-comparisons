So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their new baby and certain restrictions they've set regarding who can hold the child.\n\nFirst, the author mentions not allowing smokers near their two-month-old. They don't want the baby to smell smoke or be exposed to secondhand smoke. They also don't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Others are calling them a \"bitch\" for these rules. The key here is whether these restrictions are reasonable or not.\n\nSmoking around infants is a known health hazard. Secondhand smoke can cause respiratory issues and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The author is concerned about both the smell and the actual health risks. Even if the smokers wash their hands or shower, the nicotine and toxins can linger on their skin and hair, which can transfer to the baby. So, the author's stance here seems justified based on health guidelines.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, the author requires the updated version. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is particularly dangerous for infants, and the vaccine's protection wanes over time, hence the recommendation for adults to get updated. If some people haven't had the updated vaccine, they might still be at risk of carrying and transmitting the bacteria. The author is prioritizing their baby's safety here, which is a common concern.\n\nThe other people's criticism that the author is a \"bitch\" might stem from a lack of understanding or different values. However, as a parent, setting boundaries for their child's health is a responsible action. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're acting in their child's best interest. The fact that they even explain their reasons shows they're considerate, though others might not agree.\n\nIn terms of social interactions, the author is choosing their social circle based on these health concerns. While it might be inconvenient or hurt feelings, it's their prerogative to protect their child. There's no legal obligation for others to comply, but the author has the right to set personal boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decisions are based on valid health concerns for their infant, and they're making responsible choices as a parent.\n"
