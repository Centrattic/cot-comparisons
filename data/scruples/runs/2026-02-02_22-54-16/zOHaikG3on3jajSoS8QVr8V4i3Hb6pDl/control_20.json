So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the new parent not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter because they smoke and aren't up to date on their whooping cough vaccine. They explain their reasons, but others are calling them a \"bitch.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Smoking is a big concern for infants because secondhand smoke can cause serious health issues. The CDC and other health organizations recommend that infants not be exposed to secondhand smoke. So, the parent's stance on not allowing smokers to hold the baby is medically supported. Even if they wash their hands, the smell of smoke can linger and pose a risk. Same with the whooping cough vaccine\u2014pertussis can be deadly for newborns, and being up to date on the vaccine is important for protection. \n\nOn the other hand, the other people argue that the author is being harsh because the smokers are washing their hands and showering. But the parent is making a health decision based on their baby's safety. It's their right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. The fact that others are calling them names suggests a possible misunderstanding of these health risks.\n\nI should also think about social dynamics. The parent is making choices for their child, and while it might cause tension, it's not unreasonable. Parents often have to make tough decisions about who interacts with their children, especially when there are health risks involved. The other people's reactions might be more about feeling excluded rather than a valid health concern. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent is acting in their child's best interest based on medical advice. They have the right to set these boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
