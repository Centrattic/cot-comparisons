So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author of the post is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They have clear reasons: avoiding secondhand smoke exposure and protecting against whooping cough. However, others are calling them a \"bitch\" for these decisions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, increasing the chance of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and other issues. Even if smokers wash their hands, the smoke particles can linger on their skin and clothes, leading to passive exposure. So, the author's stance on keeping smokers away seems medically justified.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, pertussis is highly contagious and can be deadly for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't been up to date, especially those in close contact with babies. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccination, that's a legitimate concern. The author is taking precautions to protect their vulnerable child, which is a responsible action.\n\nThe author is also limiting who comes into their home, which is their right as a parent. While others might feel excluded or upset, the author's priority is their child's safety. The judgment from others about being a \"bitch\" might reflect their own discomfort with the restrictions, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Parents often make tough decisions that others don't agree with, especially when it comes to their children's health.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being overly cautious or excluding people unnecessarily. But given the potential risks involved, especially with a newborn, the precautions seem reasonable. The author isn't just making a personal preference; they're acting on medical advice. The fact that others can't understand or respect these boundaries doesn't negate the author's right to set them.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are based on valid health concerns, and they are within their rights to set these boundaries. The key here is protecting the baby's well-being, which outweighs others' potential feelings of being excluded. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
