So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health risks involved. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke exposure. Even if smokers wash their hands, the smell and chemicals from smoke can linger on their clothes and skin, which might affect the baby's health. I remember reading that secondhand smoke can increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and respiratory issues in infants, so that's a valid concern.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine. The author is requiring the updated vaccine. Whooping cough is a serious disease for babies, especially those under six months. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, and booster shots are needed because immunity wanes over time. If the people they know haven't updated their vaccine, they might still be carriers, even if they had the vaccine years ago. So, the risk of the baby getting whooping cough from an unvaccinated adult is real. \n\nThe author's actions are about protecting their child's health. They're setting boundaries by not allowing these people into their house. Others are calling them a \"bitch,\" but that might be because they don't fully understand the health implications. The author isn't being cruel; they're making a health decision based on medical advice.\n\nI should also consider social aspects. People might feel excluded or offended, but the author is prioritizing their child's well-being. It's their right to make decisions about their child's safety. The key here is whether the author's reasons are legitimate and if they're overreacting. Given the medical reasons, it seems justified. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are acting in their child's best interest based on valid health concerns. The other people's reactions might stem from misunderstanding or not taking the risks seriously enough.\n"
