So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are avoiding secondhand smoke from smokers and ensuring others have the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. The author's friends or family members are upset, calling them a bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the author's reasons. Smoking is a known health hazard, especially for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advises against secondhand smoke exposure for children because it can lead to respiratory issues, SIDS, and other health problems. The author's concern isn't just about the smell but the actual health risks. So, refusing smokers isn't unreasonable from a health perspective.\n\nThen there's the vaccine part. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious illness for infants, and the vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't been updated. The Tdap vaccine, which includes protection against pertussis, is advised for adults who haven't received it, especially those in close contact with infants. The author is making a reasonable decision to protect their baby by ensuring close contacts are vaccinated. People who haven't updated their vaccine might not realize the importance, but the author's stance is medically sound.\n\nThe other side is the social judgment from the people they're excluding. The people claim they wash hands and shower daily, but the author points out that these actions don't eliminate secondhand smoke residue. The author is taking proactive steps to protect their child, which is their right as a parent. The label of \"bitch\" seems harsh, as the author is prioritizing their child's health.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author's decisions are based on valid health concerns. The people being excluded might not fully understand the risks or are defensive about their habits. The author isn't being inconsiderate without reason; they're making choices in their child's best interest. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
