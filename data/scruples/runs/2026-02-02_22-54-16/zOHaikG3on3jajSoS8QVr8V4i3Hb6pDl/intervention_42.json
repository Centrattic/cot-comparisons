So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves not wanting smokers and unvaccinated individuals to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author doesn't allow smokers to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke and the smell. They also don't let people without the updated whooping cough vaccine near the baby. Others are calling them a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries.\n\nThe author's reasons seem valid from a health and safety perspective. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, increasing the chance of respiratory issues and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The American Academy of Pediatrics does advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. As for the vaccine, pertussis (whooping cough) can be severe in infants, and the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in close contact with babies.\n\nThe people the author is excluding are smokers and unvaccinated, even if they claim to have good hygiene. Handwashing and showering don't eliminate the risk of secondhand smoke particles that can linger on clothes and skin. Similarly, not having the updated vaccine leaves the baby vulnerable to a serious illness.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child, which is their right as a parent. The criticism from others seems to be dismissing valid health concerns. While it's understandable that some might feel excluded, the parent's priority is the baby's well-being. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable beyond what medical guidelines recommend.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
