So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about not allowing smokers near the baby and requiring the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands. They mention that the smokers smoke a pack a day near the front door, which is close to the baby's bouncer. The reasoning is about avoiding secondhand smoke exposure and the smell lingering on the baby or her clothes. The others are calling the author a \"bitch\" because they wash their hands and shower daily. The author avoids their houses as a result.\n\nThen, the author also requires the whooping cough vaccine. Some people haven't updated their vaccine, arguing it's not necessary. The author is strict about this too.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nSecondhand smoke is a known health hazard. Even if someone has washed their hands, the smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on their clothes and skin. So, the author's concern is valid from a health perspective. Medical guidelines often recommend keeping babies away from smokers. So, the author's stance here is protective.\n\nRegarding the whooping cough vaccine, it's a common recommendation for anyone handling infants. Whooping cough can be deadly for babies, and the vaccine is updated because immunity wanes over time. If others haven't updated their vaccines, they might not be protected, risking the baby. So, the author's policy is also medically sound.\n\nThe people in question are defensive, calling the author names and dismissing their concerns. The author is prioritizing their child's health, which is a parent's right. Even if others feel slighted, the author isn't obligated to compromise their child's safety for others' feelings.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're making reasonable decisions based on health risks, and it's their responsibility to protect their child.\n"
