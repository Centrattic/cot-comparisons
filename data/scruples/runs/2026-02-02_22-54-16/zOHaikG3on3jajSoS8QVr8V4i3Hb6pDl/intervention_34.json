So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author had a two-month-old baby and is refusing certain people to hold her. The reasons given are not allowing smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is harmful, especially to infants. The CDC and other health organizations do recommend avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke for babies because it can lead to respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other problems. So the author's concern there is valid. Even if the people wash their hands, the smell might linger on their clothes, and the actual smoke exposure near the baby's area is a risk. So that part seems reasonable.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is a serious illness for infants. The acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended, and boosters are advised for adults because immunity wanes over time. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, they could be a risk, even if they've had other vaccines. So the author's stance on that is also medically sound. \n\nThe other people are calling the author a bitch, but the author is prioritizing the baby's health. Personal choices about one's own child are usually protected, as long as they're not harmful to others. The author isn't forcing others to change their habits; they're just not inviting them into their home. So it's about their own child's safety. \n\nSo from a health perspective, the author is justified. Socially, others might find it harsh, but health and safety of the infant should take precedence. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
