So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. They've explained their reasons: avoiding secondhand smoke smell and the risk of whooping cough. However, others are calling them a bitch for these choices.\n\nSo, the key points here are the health and safety of the baby. Smoking in the vicinity can be dangerous for infants, even if the people wash their hands. Secondhand smoke exposure is a known risk, especially for young babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend that infants not be exposed to secondhand smoke. So, from a health perspective, the author is doing the right thing to protect their child.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't been vaccinated, especially those who will be around infants. Whooping cough can be life-threatening for babies under 6 months. The author is concerned about unvaccinated people being near the baby, which again aligns with medical advice. The people in question might not realize the importance of the updated vaccine, but the author's stance is about protecting the baby's health.\n\nThe other people's reactions are that the author is being judgmental or a \"bitch.\" However, the author is setting boundaries for their own child's safety. It's not about judging others' habits but preventing potential harm to the baby. It's important to note that parents have the right to make decisions about their child's environment based on their beliefs and medical advice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it would mean the author is being unreasonable. But given the health risks involved, the author is acting in their child's best interest. Therefore, the answer should be B (no), the author is not in the wrong. They're making informed decisions to protect their infant's health, which is a valid and responsible approach.\n"
