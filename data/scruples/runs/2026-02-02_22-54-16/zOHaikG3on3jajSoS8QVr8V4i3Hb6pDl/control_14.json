So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The parent doesn't want smokers around the baby. The article mentions that secondhand smoke is harmful to infants, so even if they wash their hands, the smell and residue can still be an issue. Plus, the smokers are near the baby's bouncer. Health organizations do advise against secondhand smoke for babies, so that's a valid health concern.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. The parent requires the updated vaccine. Whooping cough can be deadly for infants, and the immunity from the vaccine wanes over time, so boosters are recommended. If some people haven't had the updated vaccine, they might not be protected, even if they had it before. So the parent's precaution is understandable to protect the baby.\n\nThe parent is being criticized for being a \"bitch.\" But they're setting boundaries for their child's health. It's their right to prioritize their child's safety. The fact that others have poor hygiene isn't directly related, but the main points are about health risks. \n\nNo one is asking if these boundaries are extreme or unnecessary. The parent's actions are protective measures based on medical advice. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
