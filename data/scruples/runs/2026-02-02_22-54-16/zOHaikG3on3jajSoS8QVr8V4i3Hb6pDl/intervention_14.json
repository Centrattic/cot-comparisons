So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves them not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about secondhand smoke and the residue from smokers. Even if they wash their hands, the smell might linger on their clothes or skin. The author doesn't want their baby exposed to that, which makes sense because secondhand smoke is harmful to infants. The people they're talking to argue that since they wash their hands and shower daily, it's okay. But the author is taking a stand to protect their child's health. \n\nThen there's the vaccination part. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious illness for babies, and the vaccine needs to be updated every 10 years. The author is cautious not to let unvaccinated people near their child, which is a common precaution for parents. The others say the vaccine isn't necessary, but the author is taking a responsible approach to prevent any risk.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding these people from coming to their house or visiting theirs. The question is whether this is justified. From a health and safety standpoint, protecting an infant from secondhand smoke and infectious diseases is a valid concern. The author isn't being mean without reason; they have a legitimate health-based rationale. The people around them are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which seems unfair because the author is prioritizing their child's well-being. \n\nI think the author is in the right here. They have the right to set boundaries to protect their child. It's their responsibility as a parent to minimize risks, especially for a vulnerable infant. The others might not agree, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
