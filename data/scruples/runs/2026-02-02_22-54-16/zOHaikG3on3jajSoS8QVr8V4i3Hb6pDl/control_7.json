So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The key points here are the author's concerns and the others' reactions.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold their baby. They mention that even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell of smoke could linger. Secondhand smoke is a known health risk for infants, so that's a valid concern. The other people are calling the author a bitch, but the author is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. That seems reasonable.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. The author requires visitors to have the updated vaccine. Whooping cough can be deadly for infants, so not having the vaccine is a risk. The others argue they don't need the update, but medical advice usually recommends the updated version for close contact with babies. So the author's stance here is about preventing a serious illness.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding these people's houses to enforce these rules. Others are criticizing them, but the author has a right to protect their child. Parenting often involves making tough decisions about safety, even if it strains relationships. So the answer here is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their child's health, which is their responsibility.\n"
