So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not letting certain people hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are that some people smoke and others haven't had the updated whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against exposing babies to secondhand smoke because it can cause respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other problems. So, the author's concern about not wanting smokers to hold their daughter seems valid from a health perspective. Even if the smokers wash their hands or shower, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and in their environment, which the baby could be exposed to. The author's decision to avoid letting them in the house is a protective measure.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a serious illness for infants, especially since their immune systems are not fully developed. The updated vaccine (Tdap) is recommended for adults who will be in contact with babies. The author is right to be cautious here. Even if the people haven't had the latest vaccine, the author has every right to protect their child. The people in question might not realize the severity of the risk, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to set boundaries.\n\nThe other people's reactions, calling the author a \"bitch,\" seem harsh. It's their right to have opinions, but the author is making health and safety decisions for their child. Personal choices about one's own health and the health of their family should be respected. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're taking proactive steps to protect their baby. \n\nSo, considering the health risks involved and the right to set boundaries for the protection of a child, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
