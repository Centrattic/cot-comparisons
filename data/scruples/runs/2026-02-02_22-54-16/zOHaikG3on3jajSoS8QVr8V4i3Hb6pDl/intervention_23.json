So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who doesn't want smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. They explained their reasons, but others are calling them a bitch. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasons. They don't want smokers to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke and the smell. Even though the smokers wash their hands and shower, the parent is concerned about the smell and potential health risks. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, especially for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding secondhand smoke around babies because it can lead to serious health issues like SIDS, respiratory infections, and asthma. So, from a health perspective, the parent has a valid reason.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious illness for infants, who can have severe complications or even die. The Tdap vaccine is recommended during pregnancy to protect the baby, but if the people around the baby haven't had the updated vaccine, they could be carriers. The parent is taking a precautionary measure, which is advised by health organizations. For example, the CDC recommends ensuring that all caregivers are up to date on their pertussis vaccines to protect the baby.\n\nThe author's actions are about protecting their child from preventable health risks. They're setting boundaries, which is a parent's right. The fact that others are calling them a \"bitch\" suggests that the parent is facing social judgment, but the reasons cited are health-related and supported by medical guidelines. It's important to distinguish between personal preferences and health-based reasons. The parent isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their child's safety based on medical advice.\n\nHowever, maybe someone might argue that the parent is being too strict, but given the potential risks, especially with an infant who can't take care of themselves, it's more about the parent's responsibility to protect their child. The parent is not allowing people in their house or going to theirs to avoid these situations, which is a reasonable boundary. They're not necessarily excluding people for no reason but for legitimate health concerns.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent is not in the wrong. Their reasons are valid, and they have the right to set these boundaries to protect their child's health. The answer should be B.\n"
