So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the new parent not wanting smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Smoking is a big concern because secondhand smoke is harmful, especially to infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell might linger on their clothes, and the smoke near the front door could affect the baby in the bouncer. So that part seems reasonable.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is very dangerous for newborns, and the immunity from the vaccine can wear off over time. The updated vaccine is recommended for adults who are around infants to prevent transmission. If some people haven't had the updated vaccine, the parent is justified in being cautious.\n\nThe parent is also setting boundaries by avoiding those people in their home. Others are calling them a \"bitch,\" but that's their reaction, not necessarily a valid argument. The parent's decisions are based on protecting their child's health, which is a primary responsibility.\n\nSo the author's actions are about protecting their baby's health. The people around them might not agree, but the parent is acting in the baby's best interest. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
