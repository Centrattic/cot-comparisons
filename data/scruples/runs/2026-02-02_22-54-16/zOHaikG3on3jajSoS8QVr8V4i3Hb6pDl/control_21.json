      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are that some people smoke a pack a day and others haven't updated their Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author doesn't want smokers to hold their baby even if they've washed their hands. The reasoning is about avoiding secondhand smoke and the smell. Then there's the vaccine part\u2014specifically the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine update. The author is taking precautions by not letting these people near their child, but others are calling them a bitch for it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down.\n\nStarting with the smoking issue. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, especially for infants. The CDC and other health organizations recommend avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke for babies because their respiratory systems are underdeveloped. Even if someone washes their hands, they might still carry smoke residue on their clothing or breath, which can affect the baby. So from a health perspective, the author's stance makes sense. The people smoking a pack a day are exposing the baby to secondhand smoke if they're near her, even if they wash their hands. The fact that they smoke near the front door where the baby's bouncer is is another risk. So the author is trying to protect their child from preventable health risks.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis is a serious disease for infants, and the vaccine (Tdap) is recommended for adults who haven't had it or haven't had the updated version. Whooping Cough can be deadly for babies under six months. The author is being cautious by ensuring that people near the baby have the updated vaccine. The people in question are saying it's not necessary, but health guidelines recommend the updated vaccine for those in contact with infants. So the author's decision here is also about preventing a life-threatening illness.\n\nNow, the other people's reactions. They're calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is a harsh reaction. Their arguments are that they've washed their hands and showered, but that doesn't address the actual risks of secondhand smoke. Similarly, the vaccine argument isn't about hygiene but about immunization. The author's actions are about protecting the baby's health, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nSo, the author is making reasonable decisions based on medical advice. They're not being unreasonable; they're taking precautions to protect their infant from known dangers. The other people's judgment seems to stem from not understanding the health risks involved. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The correct answer should be B.\n"
