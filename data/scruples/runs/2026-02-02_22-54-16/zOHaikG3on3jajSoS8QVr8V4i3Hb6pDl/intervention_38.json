So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author of the situation (AITA) is asking if they're at fault for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are avoiding smokers and people who haven't updated their Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Newborns and infants have developing immune systems, so exposure to secondhand smoke is a major concern. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations do recommend that infants not be exposed to secondhand smoke because it can lead to respiratory issues, SIDS, and other health problems. Even if someone has washed their hands, the residual smell of smoke can linger, and the actual secondhand smoke exposure happens when they're near the baby. So the author's stance on not allowing smokers near the baby is definitely in line with medical advice. \n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, Pertussis is a serious illness for infants, especially those under six months. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for close contacts, including grandparents and caregivers, to protect the baby. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, they could potentially expose the baby to Pertussis, which can be life-threatening. The author is right to be cautious here.\n\nThe people in question are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is unfair. The author is making reasonable health decisions for their child. Critics might argue about personal choices, but when it comes to protecting an infant's health, those choices are valid. The author isn't being cruel; they're prioritizing their child's safety. \n\nIt's also important to note that the author isn't being exclusive just for the sake of it. They have specific, health-based reasons. The people they're excluding are smokers and unvaccinated individuals, which are recognized risks. The author isn't being judgmental beyond those health concerns.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are based on protecting their child from preventable health risks. The answer should be B (No).\n"
