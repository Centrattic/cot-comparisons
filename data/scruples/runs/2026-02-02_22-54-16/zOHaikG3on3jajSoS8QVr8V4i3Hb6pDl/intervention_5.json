So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They explained their reasons but faced backlash from others, who called them a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the author's concerns. Smoking and secondhand smoke is a legitimate health concern for infants. The CDC and other health organizations do advise against exposing babies to secondhand smoke because it can lead to serious health issues like sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and more. So, the author's stance on not allowing smokers to hold their baby seems reasonable from a health and safety perspective. The fact that smokers have washed their hands or showered doesn't eliminate the risk of secondhand smoke exposure, especially if they smoke near the baby's area. The smell clinging to their clothes is also a valid concern since the chemicals in smoke can linger on fabric and skin.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, the updated Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those who will be in close contact with infants. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is particularly dangerous for babies, as their immune systems aren't strong enough to fight it off. The author's decision to only allow vaccinated individuals to hold their daughter is a protective measure. Even if some people claim the vaccine isn't necessary, the medical advice supports the author's position. The author's boundaries are based on medical recommendations, so they are acting in their child's best interest.\n\nThe other people's reactions, calling the author a \"bitch,\" suggest that they might be defensive or dismissive of these health concerns. However, the author has the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. It's understandable that new parents might be more protective, and it's their responsibility to prioritize their child's health. The author isn't being unreasonable or cruel; they're making informed decisions to protect their baby from preventable risks. So, in this case, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
