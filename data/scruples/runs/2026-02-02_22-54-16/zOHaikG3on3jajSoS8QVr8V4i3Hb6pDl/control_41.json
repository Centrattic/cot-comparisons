So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are that some people smoke a lot and others haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the two main points. The first is about smokers. The author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they wash their hands. They mention that the smokers smoke near the front door, which is close to the baby's bouncer. The other people are saying the author is being a bitch because the smokers wash their hands and shower daily. The author avoids having them over or visiting their houses.\n\nThe second point is about the Whooping Cough vaccine. The author doesn't allow anyone without the updated vaccine near the baby. Some people argue it doesn't need to be updated, but the author insists on it.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From a health and safety perspective, secondhand smoke is harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against exposing babies to smoke. Even if someone washes their hands, the smoke residue on their clothes can still pose a risk. So the author's stance here is medically supported.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, pertussis is highly contagious and dangerous for newborns. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in contact with babies. Not having the updated vaccine puts the baby at risk. So the author's decision is also medically sound.\n\nThe other people calling the author a bitch might be dismissive of the health risks. Just because the smokers shower or wash hands doesn't eliminate the risk from smoke residue. The author's actions are about protecting their child's health, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decisions are based on valid health concerns for their infant. The answer should be B (No).\n"
