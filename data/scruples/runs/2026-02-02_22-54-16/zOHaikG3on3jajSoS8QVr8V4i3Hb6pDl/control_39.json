So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the author has two main rules: no smokers and no unvaccinated (specifically whooping cough) people around the baby. They explain the reasons\u2014secondhand smoke and the risk of disease. The people they're excluding argue that washing hands and showering are enough, and they don't see the need for the whooping cough vaccine update.\n\nI need to consider health and safety. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding all exposure. So the author's stance on smokers is supported by medical advice. For the vaccine, whooping cough (pertussis) is serious for babies. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults around infants, even if they were vaccinated before. If those people haven't updated their vaccine, they could pose a risk. The author's decision here is also medically sound.\n\nThe people involved are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is unkind. But the author is setting boundaries for their child's safety. While the author's rules might be strict, they are based on valid health concerns. The people being excluded might not realize the importance of these precautions. The author is not being unreasonable; they're protecting their baby. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
