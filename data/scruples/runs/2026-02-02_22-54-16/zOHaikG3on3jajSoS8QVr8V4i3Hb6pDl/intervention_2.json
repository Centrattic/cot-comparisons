So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main issues are the smokers and the people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers near their baby. They mentioned that even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell lingers on their clothes, and secondhand smoke is a risk. The people involved are smoking a pack a day and doing so near the baby's bouncer. The author's reasoning seems valid because secondhand smoke is dangerous for infants, and the smell can affect the baby's environment. The others are calling the author a \"bitch,\" but their argument isn't about health\u2014it's about washing hands and showering daily, which the author points out doesn't address the smoke residue.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis is a serious disease for infants, and the vaccine needs to be updated because immunity wanes over time. The author is concerned about people who haven't gotten the updated vaccine. The others argue it's not necessary, but that's a factual error. Pertussis boosters are recommended for adults, especially those around babies, to prevent transmission. The author is acting in the baby's best interest here.\n\nThe author is taking precautions based on medical recommendations. They're not allowing these people into their home or visiting them to avoid the baby being exposed. While it might make relationships tense, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their child's safety. The other people's reactions are dismissive and don't acknowledge the health risks. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing the baby's health. So, the answer should be B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
