So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author doesn't want smokers to hold their two-month-old daughter, even if they've washed their hands. They also require people to have the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Others are calling them a bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health risks. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend keeping infants away from smoke. So the author's concern about secondhand smoke is valid. Even if the smokers have washed their hands, the smell and potential chemical residues could still linger on their clothes or in their vicinity, which isn't good for the baby.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, the pertussis vaccine is crucial because whooping cough can be severe in infants. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults, especially those around infants. If some people haven't gotten it, they might be a risk. The author's insistence on the vaccine is medically sound.\n\nThe other people are dismissing the author's concerns as being a \"bitch,\" which is a judgmental and hurtful response. The author is acting in their child's best interest based on medical advice. So, the author isn't being unreasonable. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
