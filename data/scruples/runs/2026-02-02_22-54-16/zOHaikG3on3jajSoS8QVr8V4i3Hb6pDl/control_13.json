So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about not allowing smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby. They mention that even if the smokers have washed their hands, the smell of smoke could linger on their clothes or the baby. Secondhand smoke is a known health risk for infants, so avoiding exposure is a legitimate concern. The other people are calling the author a \"bitch,\" but that seems like a harsh reaction. It's understandable that a new parent would want to protect their baby from harmful substances, even if others don't agree.\n\nNext, the vaccine issue. The author is concerned about the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants, especially under six months. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it recently, especially those in close contact with babies. If some people in their circle haven't updated their vaccine, the author's stance is based on protecting the baby's health. The others argue it's not necessary, but the author's reasoning is valid given the medical advice.\n\nThe author is also avoiding visiting these people's homes, which makes sense if their environment (like smoking near the door) could expose the baby to smoke. The key here is whether the author's decisions are reasonable. From a health and safety perspective, both concerns are valid. New parents often have strict rules to protect their babies, and it's their responsibility to do so. The other people's judgment (\"you're a bitch\") isn't justified because the author is acting in their child's best interest. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
