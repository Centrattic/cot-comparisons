So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so exposure to secondhand smoke is definitely a risk. Even if someone washes their hands, the smoke particles can linger on their clothes and skin. The American Academy of Pediatrics does warn against secondhand smoke around infants, so the author's concern is valid.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for anyone in close contact with a baby. The author is concerned because some people haven't had the updated version. Pertussis can be deadly for infants, so it's a legitimate precaution. The people in question might not realize the severity, but the author is taking precautions for their child's safety.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding these people from their home. The question is whether this is reasonable. It's their right to set boundaries for their child's safety. The people are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which seems harsh. The author's reasons are health-based, not personal attacks. So, the answer is probably B. The author is not in the wrong because they're protecting their child from known health risks.\n"
