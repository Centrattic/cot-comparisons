So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who doesn't want certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter because they smoke and haven't updated their Whooping Cough vaccine. The person is being called a \"bitch\" by others, so they're seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so exposure to secondhand smoke is a significant risk. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, strongly advises against any exposure to tobacco smoke because it can cause respiratory issues, SIDS, and other problems. The parent's concern about secondhand smoke is medically valid.\n\nSecond, the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine is crucial for infants. Even if someone isn't showing symptoms, they can be asymptomatic carriers. The DTaP vaccine is typically given in a series, and the Tdap booster is recommended for adults, especially those in close contact with infants. If the people in question haven't had the updated vaccine, they could potentially pass on the infection, which is severe for newborns.\n\nThe parent is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. Others are dismissing these concerns, suggesting hygiene like washing hands and showering, but those don't eliminate the risk of secondhand smoke or pertussis. The argument that washing hands makes it okay is invalid because smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on clothes and skin, and pertussis is contagious through respiratory droplets.\n\nThe social judgment here is problematic. Calling someone a \"bitch\" for prioritizing their child's health isn't acceptable. The parent's decisions are based on medical advice and personal responsibility. They're not being unreasonable; they're taking proactive steps to protect their vulnerable child. The others are not respecting the parent's authority and health decisions, which is a common issue in such situations.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't in the wrong. Their actions are justified by health risks, and the criticism they're receiving is unwarranted. The answer should be B.\n"
