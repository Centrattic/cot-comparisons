So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong regarding their baby's safety. The situation involves two main issues: not allowing smokers to hold their two-month-old daughter and not allowing people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold their baby, even if they've washed their hands. The reason given is to prevent the baby from smelling smoke or being exposed to secondhand smoke. The people involved smoke near the front door and near the baby's bouncer. They argue that they wash their hands and shower daily. But the author avoids letting them into the house or visiting theirs. \n\nSecond, the author also requires the updated Whooping Cough vaccine for anyone near the baby. Some people haven't gotten the updated vaccine, claiming it's not necessary, but the author isn't allowing them near the baby.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nRegarding the smokers: Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants. Even if someone has washed their hands, their clothes might still carry smoke residue, which can affect the baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend avoiding smoke exposure for infants. So, from a health perspective, the author's stance makes sense. The people in question smoking near the baby's bouncer is especially concerning because that's a common area where the baby might be placed, increasing exposure risk. The author's refusal to let them hold the baby isn't just about handwashing but the lingering effects of smoke. The people calling the author a \"bitch\" might be misunderstanding the health risks involved.\n\nFor the Whooping Cough vaccine: Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is highly contagious and extremely dangerous for infants under six months, as their immune systems are not yet strong enough to handle it. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to receive the updated version, especially those in close contact with babies. If someone hasn't updated their vaccine, they could be a risk. The author's requirement is in line with medical advice. The people's claim that the vaccine isn't necessary is incorrect, as the updated vaccine is crucial for protection. \n\nThe author is making decisions based on the health and safety of their baby. They are not being inconsiderate; they are prioritizing their child's well-being. The fact that others are upset and call the author a \"bitch\" suggests that they might not be aware of the severity of these health risks. \n\nSo, considering both points, the author is acting in the best interest of their child. Their stance is supported by medical guidelines. The people in question might be underestimating the risks or not understanding the importance of these precautions. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
