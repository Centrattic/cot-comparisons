She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that they were hanging out a lot, both seemed to have feelings, but then the girl was revealed to be dating someone else who looks similar. The author got hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, a friend called them creepy for continuing to pursue her, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl has a boyfriend, so any romantic pursuit from someone else is problematic. The author might have thought they were moving towards a relationship, but the girl chose to be with someone else. The author's actions after finding out\u2014getting hurt, then trying to maintain the friendship\u2014could be seen as crossing a line if they're still pursuing her despite her being in a relationship. \n\nEven though the author claims they love the friendship, the fact that they still have feelings and are trying to pursue her might not be respecting the girl's current relationship. The boyfriend's disapproval is another sign that the author's presence might be complicating things. Also, the friend's warning about being creepy suggests that the author's behavior is unwelcome.\n\nThe author might not realize that just because the girl was spending time with them and showed affection doesn't mean she's open to a relationship. She might have been maintaining the friendship while being in a committed relationship, which the author didn't consider. Pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can lead to emotional harm and breaches trust. \n\nSo, even if the author's intentions are good, continuing to pursue a girl who's already in a relationship is typically seen as inappropriate. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're pursuing someone who's unavailable, regardless of the initial signs of mutual interest.\n"
