She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation involves the author spending a lot of time with the girl, feeling they were moving towards a relationship, then finding out she's dating someone similar. He got hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl.\n\nFirst, the girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing someone who's not available. Even if they had a close friendship, continuing to pursue her after finding out she's with someone else is problematic. The author mentions feeling she was moving towards a relationship, but maybe he misread the signals. The key issue is respecting boundaries once he knew she had a boyfriend. His friend's warning about being creepy suggests that his actions might be overstepping. Also, the boyfriend's discomfort indicates that the author's behavior is causing tension. So, even if he stopped talking for a few days, going back and continuing to hang out could be seen as persistent pursuit. The author's belief that there's hope might not be valid if she's committed to her current relationship. Therefore, the answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
