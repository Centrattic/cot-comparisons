She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. They were close friends, hanging out a lot, and both seemed to have feelings. Then the author found out she's dating someone who looks like him. The key points here are: she's in a relationship, the author knew about it after some time, and they kept interacting despite her boyfriend's disapproval.\n\nFirst, the girl is with someone else, so the author pursuing her while she's in a committed relationship could be seen as problematic. Even if they were friends and had mutual feelings, once she's in a relationship, continuing to pursue her might interfere with that relationship. The author mentions that they stopped talking for a few days but then resumed, which suggests they didn't completely cut it off. Also, the friend called them creepy, which is a red flag. The author's actions could be making the boyfriend uncomfortable and might be seen as disrespectful towards the existing relationship. Even if the author believes there's \"hope,\" it's not the girl's to give if she's in a relationship. The main issue here is respecting boundaries once the relationship status is known. So, yes, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
