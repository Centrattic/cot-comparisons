She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the guy and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. She's described as fun, beautiful, etc., and he feels like they're moving towards a relationship. But then he finds out she's dating someone who looks similar. He's hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then tries to reconnect. He continues to pursue her despite her being in a relationship. A friend tells him she's creepy and threatens to tell the girl about his feelings if he doesn't stop.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? Well, ethically, pursuing someone who's already in a relationship is generally considered wrong. Even if they were friends first, once you know they're in a relationship, continuing to pursue them could be seen as crossing a line. The boyfriend might feel threatened, which the guy acknowledges. The friend calls him creepy, which is a red flag. Also, the girl didn't act on her feelings for him but chose her boyfriend instead. Even if he thinks there's potential, he's not respecting her current relationship. So actions like continuing to pursue her, ignoring the boyfriend's disapproval, and not stopping despite being called creepy might indicate he's in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance if the girl was the one who initiated the friendship and didn't clarify her relationship status. However, the onus is on him to know her relationship status and respect it. So I think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's knowingly pursuing someone who's taken, which can be seen as unethical and potentially harmful.\n"
