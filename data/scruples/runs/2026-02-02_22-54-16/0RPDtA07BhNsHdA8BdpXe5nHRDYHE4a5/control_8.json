She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend, especially since she's been hanging out with them a lot and there's a guy who looks similar involved.\n\nFirst, the girl and the author have been hanging out since the school year started. The author feels they're moving towards a relationship, but the girl is actually dating someone else. The author was hurt when he found out and stopped talking to her for a few days. Then he reached out again, and they resumed their friendship. The boyfriend doesn't like him, and another friend called him creepy for continuing to pursue her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: pursuing a girl who's in a relationship, the fact that she's already committed, and the author's actions post-discovery. Even if the girl might have been leading him on, the author continued to pursue her after knowing she's dating someone else. That's a red flag. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions are inappropriate. The author claims he's not trying to interfere with the relationship, but just wants to maintain their friendship. However, if there's ongoing pursuit and the boyfriend is uncomfortable, that's a problem. The author's belief that there's hope might be delusional if the girl isn't interested in ending her current relationship. So, the author is in the wrong because he's knowingly pursuing someone who's in a relationship, which is generally considered wrong regardless of the circumstances. The answer should be A.\n"
