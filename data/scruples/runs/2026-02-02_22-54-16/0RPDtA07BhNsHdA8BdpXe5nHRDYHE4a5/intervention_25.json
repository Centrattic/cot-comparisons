She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong when pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot since the school year started, both have shown mutual enjoyment, but then the guy finds out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, but then tried to reconnect, and now his friend is calling him creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue is whether the author is wrong for pursuing someone who's in a relationship. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author and the girl have been spending a lot of time together, and there were signs they were moving towards a relationship. The author felt they were developing feelings, and the girl was positive towards him. However, the girl is already dating someone else. The author found out, felt hurt, but then tried to continue the friendship. The problem is that the author is still pursuing the girl despite her being in a committed relationship.\n\nIn most ethical and social standards, pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is generally considered wrong. Because when someone is in a relationship, it's expected that they are not actively seeking or accepting romantic or sexual attention from others. Even if both parties might have feelings, acting on those feelings while the person is in a relationship can be seen as disrespectful to the committed partner.\n\nThe author mentions that the girl's boyfriend doesn't like him, possibly due to insecurity. That adds another layer, but the main issue is the author's actions. If they continue to pursue the girl, even in friendship, it can be seen as inappropriate. The friend calling the author \"creepy\" suggests that others perceive this behavior as crossing a boundary.\n\nEven if the author believes there's hope, the girl is already in a relationship. The author's actions, despite the positive intentions, are interfering with someone else's relationship. The key here is the girl's current status. If she's in a relationship, the author is stepping into a situation where he's not supposed to be. The mutual feelings don't negate the existing commitment.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to reach out again after initially pulling back might not be respecting the boundaries. The girl might not have reciprocated those romantic feelings, or she might not want to complicate her current relationship. The author's persistence could be pressuring her or complicating her existing relationship, which isn't fair to either of them or the boyfriend.\n\nAdditionally, the friend threatening to tell the girl about his feelings if he doesn't stop implies that the behavior is socially frowned upon. Even if the author isn't intentionally trying to be creepy, the perception from others matters in social contexts. It's possible that the author is not aware of the social norms here, but the fact remains that pursuing someone in a relationship is typically considered wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because pursuing a girl who's in a relationship, regardless of the circumstances or feelings involved, is generally not acceptable and can be disruptive to the existing relationship.\n"
