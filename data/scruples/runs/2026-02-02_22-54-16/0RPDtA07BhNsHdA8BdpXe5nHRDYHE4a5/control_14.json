She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the query is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out since the start of the school year, and the writer felt they were moving towards a relationship. Then they found out the girl is dating someone else who looks similar. The writer is hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to rekindle their friendship. However, a friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl if they didn't stop. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The girl is in a relationship, so any romantic pursuit of her by someone else is problematic. The writer felt a connection but didn't know about the boyfriend initially. Once they found out, continuing to pursue her despite her being in a committed relationship is a red flag. Even if the writer believes there's potential, pursuing someone who's already in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as disrespecting the other person's commitment. \n\nThe writer mentions that they stopped talking for a few days but then decided to continue the friendship. The boyfriend's disapproval is mentioned, but the writer doesn't seem to consider that the boyfriend's feelings might be valid. The friend's reaction\u2014calling them creepy and threatening to expose them\u2014suggests that the behavior is indeed questionable. The writer's belief in \"hope\" when the girl is already in a relationship is a classic case of ignoring the reality of the situation. \n\nIn most ethical and relationship frameworks, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is inappropriate. The writer's actions could be seen as persistent and potentially manipulative if they are trying to create an emotional connection knowing she's with someone else. Even if the girl reciprocates some feelings, the existence of a boyfriend means that the writer is not respecting her current commitments. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend, especially after being informed, is generally considered inappropriate and a breach of social and ethical norms.\n"
