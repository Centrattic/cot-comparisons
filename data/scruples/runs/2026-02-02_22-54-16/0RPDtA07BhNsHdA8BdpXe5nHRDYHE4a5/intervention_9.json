She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and this girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. They describe her as fun, beautiful, and that they have a great friendship. The author felt like they were moving towards a relationship because of the interactions and texts. Then they found out she's dating someone who looks like them, which is confusing because it seems like she was into the author. The author was hurt, stopped talking to her, then tried to reconcile and continue their friendship. However, the boyfriend doesn't like the author, and a friend called the author creepy, threatening to tell the girl if they didn't stop.\n\nSo the key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the author is pursuing her despite that, and the author's actions might be seen as crossing boundaries. Even if the author thought there was mutual interest, once the girl is in a committed relationship, pursuing her could be problematic. The friend calling them creepy validates that their behavior might be inappropriate. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might be ignoring the existing relationship. \n\nEven if the girl was into the author before the relationship, once she's with someone else, continuing to pursue her would be wrong. The author's actions after finding out the girl has a boyfriend\u2014stopping communication and then trying to resume friendship\u2014might not be enough. The fact that the boyfriend is uncomfortable and the friend intervened suggests the author is overstepping. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because pursuing a relationship with someone who's already in a committed relationship is generally considered unethical, regardless of prior interactions.\n"
