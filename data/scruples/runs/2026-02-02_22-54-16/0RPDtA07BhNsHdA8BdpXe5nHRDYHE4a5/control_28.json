She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. Let's look at the details. \n\nThe girl and the author were hanging out a lot, and the author thought they were moving towards a relationship. The author even felt they had a special connection. Then the author finds out the girl is dating someone else who looks similar. The author was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days but then reached out again. The author is continuing to hang out with her despite her boyfriend's disapproval. A friend called the author creepy for not being upfront about their feelings.\n\nThe key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the author knew this after some time but still chose to pursue her, and the author is continuing to interact with her despite the boyfriend's dislike. The author's actions could be seen as inappropriate because they're pursuing someone who is already in a committed relationship. Even if they had a close friendship before, once the author knew about the boyfriend, continuing to pursue her could be considered wrong. The fact that the author is trying to maintain their relationship while the girl is with someone else might be seen as crossing boundaries. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's pursuit is not subtle and could be intrusive. \n\nSo, the author is aware of the girl's relationship status and still chooses to pursue her, which is generally considered inconsiderate and unethical. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
