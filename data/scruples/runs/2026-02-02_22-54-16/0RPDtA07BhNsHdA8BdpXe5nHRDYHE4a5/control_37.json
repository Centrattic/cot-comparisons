She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and the author felt they were moving towards a relationship. Then the author found out she's dating someone who looks similar to him. The author got hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then resumed hanging out. Now, a friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl unless he stops or comes clean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The girl is in a relationship, so pursuing her while she's with someone else could be problematic. The author mentions that they were friends and the girl seemed to enjoy their time together. But the key point is that she's already in a committed relationship. Even if the author thought their friendship was moving towards a relationship, the fact remains she's with someone else. The author's actions could be seen as interfering in her existing relationship, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nThe author also mentions that the boyfriend is insecure about him. That suggests that the presence of the author might be causing tension in the existing relationship. The friend calling him creepy and threatening to tell the girl is a red flag. The author might be crossing boundaries by continuing to pursue the girl after knowing she's in a relationship. Even if he felt there was a connection, pursuing someone who's taken is typically considered inappropriate.\n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't know she was in a relationship initially. The narrative says he found out later. If he didn't know she was dating someone else when he was hanging out, then maybe his actions up to that point weren't wrong. But once he knew, continuing to pursue her would be wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong now that he knows. Since he's aware of her relationship and still wants to pursue her, that's where the problem lies.\n\nAlso, the author's actions after finding out: he stopped talking for a few days but then resumed. He claims to love their friendship and the time together, but the boyfriend's disapproval and the friend's warning suggest that his behavior is not appreciated. The ethical issue here is that the girl is in a relationship, so the author shouldn't be trying to develop a romantic relationship with her. Even if they were close friends, pursuing her romantically when she's committed to someone else is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship, which is a breach of social norms and could be seen as disrespectful to her current partner. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
