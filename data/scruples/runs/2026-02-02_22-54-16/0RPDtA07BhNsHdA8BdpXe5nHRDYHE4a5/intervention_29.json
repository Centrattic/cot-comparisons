She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. \n\nFirst, key points from the story: They've been hanging out since the school year started. The girl is described as fun, beautiful, etc., and the author feels they're moving towards a relationship. The author mentions the girl told them great things and loved hanging out, which made them feel good. Then the author found out the girl is dating someone else, who looks similar. The author was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, the boyfriend is jealous, and a friend called the author creepy, threatening to tell the girl if they didn't stop.\n\nThe author's actions include continuing to pursue the girl despite her being in a relationship. Even after learning about the boyfriend, they reach out again, which might be seen as inappropriate. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior is crossing a line. \n\nLegally, there's no issue, but socially, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is often frowned upon. The girl's boyfriend disapproves, which is a sign the author's presence might be causing tension. The author's feelings of being \"creepy\" by a friend imply that others perceive their actions as inappropriate. \n\nThe author's justification is that they believe there's hope and they value their friendship. However, the girl is in a committed relationship, and the author's pursuit could be seen as undermining that. The line between friendship and romantic pursuit is blurred here. The author might not realize that the girl's actions (hanging out) don't necessarily reciprocate romantic feelings, especially with her already in a relationship. \n\nThe key issue is whether continuing to pursue someone in a relationship is wrong. Most social norms would say yes, as it's not respecting the existing relationship. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might be misguided if the girl is committed elsewhere. The threat from the friend adds another layer, indicating the author's actions are affecting others negatively. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions likely cross into inappropriate territory, making them the asshole. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
