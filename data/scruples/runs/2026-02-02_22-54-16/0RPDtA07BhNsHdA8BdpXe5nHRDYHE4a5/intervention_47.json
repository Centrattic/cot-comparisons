She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the writer says they've been hanging out with the girl since the school year started. They felt like there was a budding relationship because she texted them and they had good times. But then they found out she's dating someone else who looks like them. The writer was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then reached out again. Now, the girl's boyfriend doesn't like the writer, and a friend called the writer creepy and threatened to tell the girl.\n\nSo, the key points here: the girl is in a relationship. The writer thought there was a mutual interest, but that's not the case. The writer is continuing to pursue her even though she's with someone else. The friend's warning about being creepy and the threat to reveal feelings adds another layer.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here, but socially and ethically, pursuing a relationship with someone who's already in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong. The girl's boyfriend is uncomfortable, which suggests the writer's actions might be affecting others negatively. Even if the writer and the girl were both interested in each other, the fact that she's in a relationship complicates things. The writer's actions could be seen as undermining the boyfriend's relationship and potentially leading to emotional harm for everyone involved. The friend's reaction also points out that the writer might be overstepping boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer might argue that they didn't know about the relationship at first and were just building a friendship. But once they knew, continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship is where the issue lies. The idea that there's \"hope\" might not be valid if the girl isn't considering ending her current relationship. The writer's feelings are real, but respecting others' relationships is important.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer is in the wrong because they're pursuing someone who is already in a relationship, which is generally seen as inappropriate and can cause harm. The answer should be A.\n"
