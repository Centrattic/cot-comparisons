She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The writer mentions that they've been hanging out since the school year started, developing a close friendship, and feeling like there's potential for something more. Then they find out she's dating someone else who looks similar to them. They were hurt, stopped talking for a few days, but then reached out again. The friend is now calling them creepy and threatening to tell the girl about their feelings if they don't stop.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The writer is pursuing her despite her being with someone else. Even though they had a close friendship, the line of being friends with someone who is in a relationship can be tricky. The fact that the writer is trying to maintain a friendship while having romantic feelings could be problematic. The writer mentions that the boyfriend doesn't like them, which adds another layer of tension.\n\nBut wait, is the writer actually doing something wrong? They're not cheating or interfering in the relationship, just maintaining a friendship. However, the writer has feelings for the girl, which complicates things. Pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered inappropriate because it can lead to emotional harm for everyone involved. Even if they're just friends, the writer's actions of expressing love and wanting a relationship might be crossing a boundary that the boyfriend has.\n\nThe writer's friend is concerned and calls them creepy. That's a red flag. If someone else perceives your actions as creepy, that's a sign you might need to reconsider. Also, the writer's friend is threatening to expose their feelings, which suggests that the writer might be continuing to pursue her in ways that aren't respectful of her current relationship status.\n\nAnother point is the similarity between the boyfriend and the writer. The writer's confusion over why she chose the boyfriend over them might lead to jealousy or possessive feelings, which aren't healthy. The writer's belief that there's still hope could be ignoring the reality that the girl is in a committed relationship, and continuing to pursue her might not be fair to her or her boyfriend.\n\nIn summary, while the writer might not have malicious intent, pursuing a relationship with someone who is already in a committed relationship is generally seen as wrong. The writer's actions, despite being friends, could be leading to emotional complications and might be considered disrespectful to the existing relationship. The friend's reaction and the potential for emotional harm support the idea that the writer is in the wrong.\n"
