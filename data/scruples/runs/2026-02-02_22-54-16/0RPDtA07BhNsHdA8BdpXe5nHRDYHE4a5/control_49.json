She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation involves them hanging out a lot, both feeling good about each other, and then the writer finds out the girl is dating someone else who looks like him. He gets hurt, stops talking, then tries to reconnect, and is advised to stop by a friend.\n\nFirst, the girl has a boyfriend, so pursuing her while she's in a relationship is a problem. Even if there were mutual feelings, if she's already committed to someone else, the writer is stepping into her relationship. The fact that the boyfriend looks like him might not matter because the girl is already in a relationship, so the writer's actions could be seen as disrespectful to her current partner.\n\nThen there's the part where the writer says he loves their friendship and wants to continue hanging out despite the boyfriend's disapproval. But the boyfriend's insecurity is probably valid because the writer is still engaging with his girlfriend in a way that might be seen as inappropriate. The friend calling him creepy and threatening to tell the girl adds another layer, suggesting that others see his actions as problematic.\n\nThe key issue is that the girl is in a committed relationship, and the writer's pursuit could be interfering with that. Even if they had mutual feelings, the girl's choice to be with her boyfriend means the writer should respect that. The writer's belief that there's hope might be ignoring the reality of her current relationship status. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's pursuing someone who is already in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate.\n"
