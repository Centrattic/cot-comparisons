She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who started hanging out with a girl since the school year began. They had a lot of fun together, and both seemed to have good feelings. The guy thought they were moving towards a relationship. Then he found out she's dating someone who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, but then reached out again. He continues to hang out with her even though her boyfriend seems to dislike him. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop or confess.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are inappropriate. The key points here are that the girl is already in a relationship. The author believed there was a chance they could be together, but the girl chose someone else. The author's continued pursuit despite her being in a relationship could be problematic. Even if they were close friends before she got a boyfriend, once she's in a relationship, the dynamics change. Pursuing someone who is already in a committed relationship can be seen as respecting their current relationship or not. \n\nThe author mentions that after finding out, he stopped talking for a few days but then resumed. Continuing to hang out and not respecting the boundaries of her boyfriend's presence might be crossing a line. Also, the friend's reaction suggests that his actions are making others uncomfortable, labeling him as creepy. That could indicate that his behavior is indeed overstepping.\n\nAnother angle is the initial assumption. The author thought they were moving towards a relationship, but the girl chose someone else. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. However, once the relationship is established, it's important to respect her choice. Pursuing someone who is with another person can be considered wrong because it pressures the current relationship and may be disloyal to the boyfriend. The author's continued pursuit despite the boyfriend's discomfort shows he isn't respecting their relationship boundaries. \n\nEven if he believes there's hope, the fact that she's already in a relationship means that pursuing her could interfere with her commitments. The friend's warning about being creepy adds another layer, indicating that his actions are not socially acceptable. So, the author's actions likely make him the asshole here because he's not respecting the girl's relationship and the boyfriend's feelings. The answer should be A, meaning he's in the wrong.\n"
