She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was spending a lot of time with a girl who has a boyfriend. They thought they were developing a relationship, but then found out she's already dating someone who looks like them. The author is now pursuing her anyway and hanging out, even though the boyfriend is uncomfortable. Another friend called the author creepy and warned them to stop or confess.\n\nSo, the key points here: the girl is in a relationship, the author knew she had a boyfriend but continued to pursue her, they had a close friendship that the author thought was leading to a romantic relationship, but the girl is already committed. The author is now continuing to interact with her despite the boyfriend's disapproval. Also, the author is considering confessing their feelings, which might complicate things further.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on standard social norms. Generally, pursuing someone who is in a relationship can be seen as problematic because it's interfering with another person's committed relationship. Even if the author thought there was mutual interest, the girl is already in a relationship, so the author might be taking things the wrong way. The fact that the boyfriend looks similar doesn't justify pursuing her. The author's actions could be considered inappropriate because they're not respecting the girl's current relationship status. Also, the friend's warning suggests that the behavior is perceived as creepy, which is a red flag. The author might not realize that the girl's actions (hanging out a lot) don't necessarily indicate romantic interest beyond friendship, especially since she's committed to someone else. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they are pursuing someone who is already in a relationship, which isn't acceptable regardless of their assumptions about mutual feelings.\n"
