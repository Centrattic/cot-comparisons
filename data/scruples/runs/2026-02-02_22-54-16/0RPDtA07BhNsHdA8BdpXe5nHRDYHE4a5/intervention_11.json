She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The person describes spending a lot of time with her, developing feelings, and then finding out she's dating someone else who looks similar. They stopped talking for a few days but then reconciled and continued the friendship. However, a friend called them creepy and threatened to reveal their feelings if they didn't stop pursuing her.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship, so the author is engaging with her in a way that could be seen as inappropriate. Even if the girl's boyfriend looks similar, the author is still pursuing someone who is not available. The fact that the girl's boyfriend is insecure doesn't justify the author's actions. The author's friend labeling them as creepy suggests that their behavior might be violating social boundaries, especially given the existing relationship. \n\nThe author mentions that they love the girl and their friendship, but continuing to pursue someone who is in a relationship can be considered wrong because it's not respecting the commitments of others. Even if the girl reciprocated their feelings before knowing about the relationship, the fact that she is with someone else means the author's continued pursuit is problematic. \n\nAdditionally, the friend's threat indicates that the author's behavior might be causing discomfort or even harassment, which is a red flag. The author's belief that there's hope might be ignoring the reality that the girl is in a committed relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship, despite the circumstances. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
