She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the author and this girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. He talks about her being fun, beautiful, and that they were developing feelings. He even says she told him how great he was and loved spending time with him. But then he found out she's dating someone else who looks just like him. He was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now he's still pursuing her, and his friend called him creepy if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main issue here is that the girl is in a committed relationship. Even if they were developing feelings, the boyfriend exists, so pursuing her could be seen as interfering. The author might not realize that relationships are exclusive, so continuing to pursue her despite the boyfriend's existence is problematic.\n\nThe author says he's trying to maintain their friendship and not let it bother him. But the boyfriend's disapproval and the friend's warning suggest that his actions might be making the situation uncomfortable. The fact that the boyfriend is similar in appearance might add to the insecurity, but that doesn't justify the author's pursuit.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girl told him she loved spending time with him. However, in a relationship, expressing affection doesn't necessarily mean the person is open to another relationship. The girl might be expressing friendship, not romantic interest. The author might be misinterpreting her signals.\n\nThe friend's reaction is important here. When someone calls you creepy and threatens to reveal your actions, it's a strong indicator that your behavior is not acceptable. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" despite the existing relationship is where the problem lies. Relationships are about exclusivity, so pursuing someone who's already with someone else is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author is in the wrong for continuing to pursue a girl who's in a relationship. Even if they had a strong friendship and mutual enjoyment, the key point is the existence of the boyfriend. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
