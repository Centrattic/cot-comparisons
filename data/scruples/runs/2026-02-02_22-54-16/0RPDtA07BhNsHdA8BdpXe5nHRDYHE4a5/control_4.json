She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The writer mentions that they and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and they felt like they were close to a relationship. Then they found out she's dating someone similar to them, which upset them. They stopped talking to her for a few days but then reached out again. Their friend called them creepy for continuing to pursue her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl is in a relationship, so the writer is pursuing someone who's not single. That alone might be problematic. Even if they felt close, the boyfriend's existence is a red flag. The writer's actions of continuing to interact despite the boyfriend being around could be seen as crossing a boundary. The friend's reaction suggests that this behavior isn't socially acceptable. Also, the writer mentions that the boyfriend is uncomfortable with them, which indicates that their pursuit is causing tension in the girl's existing relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally frowned upon because it can undermine the trust and commitment between the couple. The writer's actions, while possibly stemming from genuine feelings, ignore the existing relationship boundaries. Even if the girl didn't reciprocate the feelings, the writer's persistence might be seen as inappropriate. The friend labeling them as creepy supports the idea that their behavior is not acceptable.\n\nHowever, the writer claims they reconnected after an initial break. If the girl was okay with continuing their friendship, maybe there's some ambiguity. But since the girl is with someone else, the writer's pursuit could be interfering with her relationship. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure suggests that the writer's behavior is affecting the existing relationship negatively.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the writer's feelings, pursuing a girl who's in a relationship is typically considered wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
