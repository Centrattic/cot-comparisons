She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The key points from the scenario are that the girl and the author had been hanging out a lot since the start of the school year, leading the author to believe they were moving towards a relationship. The author felt happy and even mentions the girl texting him to hang out. Then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him, which he took as a personal rejection.\n\nHe was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, but then tried to reconnect because he valued their friendship. Now, another friend is calling him creepy and threatening to tell the girl if he doesn't stop. The author is confused about whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the girl is in a relationship, so the author pursuing her while she's with someone else is definitely problematic. Even if he thought there was mutual interest, once he found out she was dating someone, continuing to pursue her becomes inappropriate. The fact that the boyfriend is similar in appearance might add to the author's confusion, but that doesn't excuse his actions. The author's actions post-discovery\u2014like trying to reconnect despite the boyfriend's disapproval\u2014could be seen as crossing boundaries. The friend's warning about being creepy and the threat to expose his feelings suggests that others see his behavior as crossing a line. The author might not realize that pursuing someone who is in a relationship, regardless of the circumstances, is generally considered wrong because it respects the existing relationship and the other person's choices. So, yes, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
