She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The author and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and he thought they were moving towards a relationship. Then he finds out she's dating someone who looks like him. He feels rejected, stops talking to her for a few days, then reconciles and keeps hanging out. His friend calls him creepy for not stopping the pursuit.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a committed relationship. The author's actions involve continuing to pursue her despite her being with someone else. Even if the author thought there was mutual interest before, once he found out about the boyfriend, maintaining that pursuit could be problematic. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure might add stress to the existing relationship, which isn't fair to either the boyfriend or the girl.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's the case. The key points are: the girl is in a relationship, the author continues to pursue her despite knowing this, and his friend's warning about being creepy. The author might not be malicious, but pursuing someone who's in a relationship can be seen as inappropriate regardless of the reasons. The author's belief in \"hope\" isn't a valid justification for continuing to pursue her. Relationships are about mutual consent and respect, and the author isn't respecting the existing commitment.\n\nSo even if the author felt the relationship was moving in a direction, once the boyfriend is in the picture, the author should have stepped back. Continuing to pursue her despite the boyfriend's presence is where the mistake lies. The friend's comment about being creepy is a red flag here. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
