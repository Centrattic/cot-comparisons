She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (let's call them AITA) has been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. They think she's amazing and they've been spending a lot of time together. AITA feels like they were moving towards a relationship because she seems to like them. But then they find out she's dating someone who looks just like them. AITA is hurt, stops talking to her, then tries to reconnect. Now their friend is calling them creepy and threatening to tell the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if AITA is doing something wrong. The girl is in a relationship, so AITA pursuing her could be problematic. Even if they thought there was a mutual connection, the fact that she's already with someone means that continuing to pursue her might interfere with her current relationship. The AITA might believe the relationship was on the rocks or that the girl was interested in them, but unless the girl explicitly ended things with her current boyfriend, AITA is still pursuing someone who is in a committed relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that the boyfriend looks like AITA might add to the confusion, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The key issue is that AITA is continuing to pursue someone who is already in a relationship. Even if the girl reciprocated some feelings, it's not their place to assume that the relationship is over. The friend calling them creepy and threatening to expose their feelings suggests that the behavior is crossing boundaries. \n\nMoreover, AITA's actions after finding out about the boyfriend\u2014stopping contact, then reconnecting\u2014might be seen as inconsistent and potentially manipulative. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure about AITA's presence indicates that AITA is making their advances known, which is disrespectful to the existing relationship. The justification that they love their friendship and want to maintain it is undermined by the persistent pursuit despite the girl being in a relationship. \n\nIn social norms, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can cause harm to all parties involved. The AITA might not see it that way because they think the girl is interested, but unless there's a mutual agreement to end the current relationship, continuing to pursue her is inappropriate. The friend's reaction highlights that this behavior is not acceptable and could be seen as stalker-like, which is a strong indicator that the AITA is in the wrong.\n"
