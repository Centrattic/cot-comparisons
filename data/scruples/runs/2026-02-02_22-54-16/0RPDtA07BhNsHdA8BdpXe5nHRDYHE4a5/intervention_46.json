She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot since school started. They both seem to enjoy each other's company, and there's mutual compliments. The author feels they're moving towards a relationship. But then, the author finds out the girl is dating someone else who looks similar. He gets hurt, stops talking for days, then reaches out again. He's still hanging out, even as the boyfriend is apparently uncomfortable. A friend calls him creepy.\n\nNow, the key points here: the girl is already in a relationship. The author knew she was dating someone else but continued to pursue her. Even after the boyfriend's disapproval, the author keeps the friendship and doesn't stop. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions cross a line, possibly into stalker-like behavior.\n\nLegally and socially, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong. It's not just about the mutual feelings but respecting the existing relationship. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might be ignoring the girl's current commitments. Even if the girl was interested before, once she's in a relationship, pursuing her could undermine her partner's trust and create a toxic situation.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as persistent and not respecting boundaries, especially after being called out as creepy. The fact that the boyfriend is uncomfortable adds to the issue. The author's justification is that he loves their friendship and the time they spend together, but that doesn't negate the fact that the girl is already committed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
