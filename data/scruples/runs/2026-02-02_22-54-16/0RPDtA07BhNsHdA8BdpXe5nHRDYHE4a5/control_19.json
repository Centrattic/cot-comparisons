She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. They had been hanging out a lot, and the author felt like there was a budding relationship. But then he found out she's dating someone who looks a lot like him, which made him feel hurt and stop talking to her for a few days. After that, he tried to reconnect, and now his friend is calling him creepy for not being upfront about his feelings to the girl.\n\nSo, the main question here is whether pursuing someone who's in a relationship is wrong. From what I know, dating someone who's already in a relationship is definitely a no-go. Even if the author felt like their friendship was hinting at a romantic connection, once he found out she has a boyfriend, continuing to pursue her would be unethical. The fact that she's with someone else means that she's in a committed relationship, and the author's actions might be complicating that.\n\nThe author stopped talking to her for a few days, which is understandable if he was hurt, but then he decided to reach out again and keep the friendship going. If he's still spending time with her after knowing she's dating someone, that's crossing a line. It's possible she's not aware of his feelings, but he's been pursuing her romantically while she's in a relationship. The friend's reaction is a sign that others see this as problematic.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the boyfriend is insecure about him. That suggests that the boyfriend is aware of his presence and the potential threat, which adds to the unethical nature. The author should have respected that the girl is in a relationship and stepped back instead of continuing to pursue her. Even if he thought there was \"hope,\" that hope is built on a foundation that's not his to be part of. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who's already committed to someone else. The answer should be A.\n"
