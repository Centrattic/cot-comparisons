She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot, both had good feelings, but then the girl is revealed to be dating someone else who looks similar. The author was hurt, stopped talking, then tried to reconnect. Now, a friend called them creepy for continuing to pursue the girl.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The author's actions involve pursuing someone who's already committed. Even if they were close friends and had mutual positive feelings, once it's clear she's with someone else, continuing to pursue her could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author might be justifying their actions by thinking there's potential, but the girl's boyfriend is present and the relationship is ongoing.\n\nThe author mentions that the girl told them she loved spending time with him, but if she's in a relationship, maybe she wasn't clear about her intentions. However, the author's responsibility is to respect her current relationship status. Pursuing a relationship with someone who's in a committed relationship can be considered unethical or inconsiderate, regardless of how things were progressing before the boyfriend was known.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction labels the author as creepy, which is a strong indicator that their behavior is socially unacceptable. The key point is that the girl is not single, so continuing to express interest or pursue her goes against social norms and respect for her existing relationship. Even if the author believes there's hope, the reality is that she's already in a committed partnership, making the author's actions problematic.\n"
