She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation says they've been hanging out a lot, both seemed to have feelings, but she's already with someone who looks like the poster. The key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the poster didn't know about the boyfriend initially, and now they're continuing to interact despite the boyfriend's disapproval.\n\nFirst, even if the girl and the poster were developing feelings, the fact remains she's in a relationship. Pursuing someone who's already in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong because it can lead to emotional harm for all parties involved. The poster's actions could be seen as interfering in another's relationship, which is often frowned upon.\n\nThe poster mentions they stopped talking for a few days but then resumed contact. Continuing to pursue a relationship with someone who's with another person, even if the feelings are mutual, is unethical. The boyfriend's disapproval adds another layer, as the poster is being confrontational. Also, the friend's reaction calls them out as creepy, which is a red flag. The poster's belief that there's \"hope\" might not consider the girl's commitment to her current partner. So, the answer is likely A, the poster is in the wrong.\n"
