She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy has been hanging out with the girl since the school year started. They both seem to enjoy each other's company. He thought they were moving towards a relationship. Then he finds out she's dating someone who looks just like him. He's hurt and stops talking to her for a few days, then tries to reconnect. The guy doesn't like him, but he continues to pursue the girl. A friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl if he doesn't stop.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl is in a relationship. The author's actions include pursuing her despite her being with someone else. Even though there might have been mutual feelings before she got a boyfriend, once she's in a relationship, pursuing her could be considered wrong. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions are inappropriate.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The line between friendship and pursuing a relationship is crossed when someone is already in a relationship. Even if there was prior interest, continuing to pursue her once she's in a relationship could be seen as disrespectful to her current partner. The author might not realize that the girl's relationship status changes the dynamics. The fact that the boyfriend is uncomfortable adds another layer, but it's not a valid reason to continue pursuing her. The friend's warning about being creepy indicates that the actions are socially unacceptable. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
