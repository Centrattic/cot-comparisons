She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person has been hanging out with a girl since the start of the school year, thinking they were moving towards a relationship. However, the girl is actually in a relationship with someone who looks similar to the author. The author is now trying to continue the friendship despite the girl's boyfriend disliking them. The friend called the author creepy for continuing to pursue her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl is in a relationship, so any romantic pursuit by the author is ethically questionable. Even if the author believes there's a connection, pursuing someone who is already in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong. The fact that the girl's boyfriend is similar in appearance doesn't justify the author's actions. The author's continued attempts to maintain a close relationship with a girl who's taken could be seen as inappropriate, especially if it's making the boyfriend uncomfortable. The friend's reaction (calling them creepy) suggests that the behavior is crossing a social boundary. The author might be in denial about the reality of the situation\u2014just because they had a good time together doesn't mean the girl isn't committed. The author's belief that there's hope is problematic because the girl is already in a relationship. So, based on that, the answer would be A (in the wrong).\n"
