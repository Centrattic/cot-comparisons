She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. They've been hanging out since the school year started, and they felt like there was a connection. The girl even said nice things to him. But then he found out she's dating someone else who looks like him.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The guy pursued her without knowing she had a boyfriend, which is problematic. Even if they were close friends, once you find out they're taken, continuing to pursue them can be seen as inappropriate. The fact that the girl's boyfriend is similar in appearance doesn't justify the actions. The guy was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days, but then resumed the friendship. That shows he's still engaging with her despite her being in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the guy confessed his feelings to a friend, who then called him creepy. That's a red flag. If someone is told they're being creepy, that's a sign their actions might be crossing boundaries. The girl's boyfriend doesn't like him, which adds to the tension. The guy's belief that there's still hope in the situation could be leading him to ignore the reality that the girl is committed elsewhere. \n\nSo, the key points are: pursuing someone who is in a relationship, continuing interaction after knowing about the boyfriend, and being labeled as creepy by a friend. These actions likely make the author the asshole here. The answer should be A.\n"
