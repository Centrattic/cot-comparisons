She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who was hanging out with a girl all year, thought they were getting closer, and then found out she was dating someone else who looks like him. He got hurt, stopped talking to her, then tried to reconnect, but his friend called him creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The key points are: he was friends with a girl who's in a relationship, he thought they had a budding relationship, but she's actually with someone else. He's continuing to pursue her even after knowing she's taken. \n\nThe main ethical issue here is whether it's wrong to pursue someone who's already in a relationship. Generally, respecting others' relationships is a social norm. Even if he thought there was a mutual connection, once he knew she was dating someone else, continuing to pursue her could be seen as crossing a line. The fact that the boyfriend looks like him adds a layer, but that doesn't justify his actions.\n\nHe stopped talking to her after finding out, but then came back. The friend's reaction says he's being creepy, which is a red flag. The girl's boyfriend is uncomfortable, which is another sign. Even if he believes there's hope, it's not the girl's or her boyfriend's responsibility to accommodate his feelings. He might be projecting his own feelings onto her, not considering her current commitment.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's trying to maintain the friendship while she's in a relationship could be problematic. The boyfriend's insecurity is a sign that his presence is causing tension. The friend threatening to tell the girl if he doesn't stop suggests others see his behavior as inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship, which can be seen as disrespectful to her partner and could harm the girl's trust if she finds out. The answer should be A.\n"
