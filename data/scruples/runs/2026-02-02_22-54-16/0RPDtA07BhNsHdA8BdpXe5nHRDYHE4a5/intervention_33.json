She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The author claims they had a close friendship, felt like a relationship was forming, but then found out she's dating someone similar to him. He stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect, and now his friend is calling him creepy.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the girl is already in a relationship. Even if the author believed there was a mutual attraction or budding feelings, once he found out she's with someone else, pursuing her could be problematic. The key point is consent. If she's in a committed relationship, the author's actions might be seen as crossing boundaries, regardless of how close they were before.\n\nThe author mentions the guy looks similar to him. That might explain why he thought she was interested, but that doesn't justify pursuing her once he knows she's taken. The fact that he continued to hang out and maybe even express feelings after she's in a relationship could be seen as inappropriate. Even if he didn't know about the boyfriend initially, the responsibility is on him to check if she's available before pursuing a relationship.\n\nAlso, the friend labeled him as creepy. That's a red flag. If someone is concerned about your behavior, it's worth reflecting. The author's friend's reaction suggests that the actions might be making others uncomfortable, which could indicate that he's overstepping.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author thought they were building a relationship before knowing about the boyfriend. However, once the boyfriend was known, continuing to pursue, even under the guise of friendship, might be seen as interfering in her relationship. The line between friendship and pursuit can be blurry, but in a relationship, there's an expectation of exclusivity in romantic contexts.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions post-discovery of the boyfriend are likely in the wrong. Even with good intentions, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally frowned upon. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
