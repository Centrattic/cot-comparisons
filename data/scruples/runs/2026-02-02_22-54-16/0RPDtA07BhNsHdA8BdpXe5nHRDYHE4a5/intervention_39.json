She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The key points here are the girl is already in a relationship, and the author is continuing to interact with her despite the boyfriend's disapproval.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've been friends since the school year started and felt a connection. But the girl is in a relationship. Even if the author thought there was potential for a relationship, the girl is already committed to someone else. Continuing to pursue someone who is in a relationship can be problematic because it might interfere with her existing relationship. The fact that the boyfriend looks similar might add some tension, but that doesn't justify pursuing her.\n\nThe author stopped talking to her for a few days after finding out, which shows some initial reaction, but then decided to continue the friendship. The issue here is maintaining a friendship while having romantic feelings when she's in a relationship. It's possible that the author is overstepping by continuing to express affection or pursue a relationship. The friend's comment that they're \"creepy\" might indicate that the author's behavior is being seen as intrusive or disrespectful to the girl's current relationship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the boyfriend doesn't like them, but that's not a valid reason to keep pursuing the girl. The main point is respecting her existing relationship. Even if there was mutual interest before she was dating, once she's in a relationship, pursuing her could be seen as undermining her partner. The author might be in the wrong because they're not respecting her relationship boundaries, even if they believe there's hope. Relationships often require respecting such boundaries to maintain trust and respect for all parties involved.\n"
