She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The user is asking for a judgment, but I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. They both seem to enjoy each other's company, and he felt like they were moving towards a relationship. But then he found out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days, then reached out again. Now he's continuing to hang out with her, even though her boyfriend is uncomfortable. A friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the author is pursuing her, and he's continuing to interact with her despite the boyfriend's disapproval. Even though he felt their friendship was meaningful, he's aware that she's with someone else. \n\nIn most ethical and social standards, pursuing someone who is in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong. It can be seen as respecting the existing relationship and not trying to interfere. The author's actions of continuing to spend time with her and expressing feelings might be making the situation uncomfortable for the boyfriend and could be seen as undermining her current relationship. Even if the author didn't know she was dating someone initially, once he found out, continuing to pursue her would be inappropriate. The fact that the friend called him creepy suggests that others see this as crossing a boundary.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that he confessed his feelings to a friend who then threatened to expose him. This adds another layer of potential issues, especially if the friend's actions were meant to protect the girl's relationship, which might imply that the author's behavior was indeed problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is in a relationship, which is generally considered respectful to avoid. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
