She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot, both seemed to have feelings, but she's actually dating someone else who looks like the author.\n\nFirst, the key point here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The author thought they had a budding relationship, but the girl chose someone else. So, the main issue is that the author is continuing to pursue her despite her being in a committed relationship. \n\nThe author mentions that they stopped talking for a few days after finding out but then decided to reach out again. They now hang out, but the boyfriend is uncomfortable. Also, the author's friend called them creepy, which is a red flag. So, the author is maintaining a friendship with someone who's in a relationship, which can be problematic if there's romantic pursuit involved.\n\nIn relationships, it's generally expected that both people are exclusive. If the girl is with someone else, the author's feelings are their own, but actively pursuing her while she's with another person is considered inappropriate. The author might not be the one who started the relationship, but continuing to pursue her after knowing she's in a relationship could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nAlso, the author's friend's reaction indicates that others see this as a problem. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might be ignoring the reality that the girl is already in a relationship. The guy the girl is dating might not be aware of the author's feelings, which could lead to more issues if they become known.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in the wrong because they are pursuing someone who is in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate. Even if their intentions are good, continuing to pursue a romantic relationship with someone who is already committed is not acceptable. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
