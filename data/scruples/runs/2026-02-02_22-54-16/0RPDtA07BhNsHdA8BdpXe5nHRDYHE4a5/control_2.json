She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is that the author and the girl have been spending a lot of time together, and the author felt like they were moving towards a relationship. But then the author found out the girl is already dating someone who looks similar. The author was hurt and stopped talking for a few days but then reached out again. Now, the author's friend is calling them creepy and threatening to tell the girl about their feelings if they don't stop.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The author is continuing to pursue her despite her being with someone else. Even if the author believed there was a mutual connection, once it's known that the girl is in a committed relationship, pursuing her could be considered inappropriate. The boyfriend's disapproval might indicate that the relationship is serious. The author's actions after finding out about the boyfriend\u2014stopping contact briefly but then resuming\u2014suggests they're still interested, which could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe author's friend calling them creepy and advising them to stop or confess implies that the friend sees the behavior as wrong or potentially harmful. The key here is consent and respect for the existing relationship. Even if the girl hasn't explicitly shut down the author's advances, her being in a relationship means that pursuing her romantically without her consent is generally frowned upon. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" despite the existing relationship might be misguided. Relationships are about mutual commitment, so pursuing someone who's already in a relationship can be seen as unethical or inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they are continuing to pursue a girl who is in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate regardless of prior interactions. The answer would be A.\n"
