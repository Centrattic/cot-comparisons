She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. They mention she's fun, beautiful, etc., and they felt they were moving towards a relationship. She even texted him to hang out, and he felt they had a connection. Then he found out she's dating someone else who looks similar. He was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then reached out again. Now he's hanging out with her despite her boyfriend's disapproval. His friend called him creepy if he doesn't stop or come clean. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship, and the author is continuing to pursue her. Even though they had a close friendship, once it's known she's dating someone else, pursuing her romantically could be considered wrong. He mentions he loves her and their relationship, but she's already in a committed relationship. The friend's reaction suggests that his actions are seen as inappropriate or creepy because he's not respecting her current relationship. \n\nEven if the girl might have feelings for him, it's still not ethical to pursue someone who's in a relationship. The author might not realize that the girl's being in a relationship is a deal-breaker regardless of their connection. The key point is that the girl is with someone else, so pursuing her could be seen as interfering in her relationship. The fact that he continues to hang out with her despite her boyfriend's disapproval isn't helping. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate. The fact that he felt he was moving towards a relationship might have been a misunderstanding, but once he knew about the boyfriend, he should have stepped back. Continuing to pursue her after that, especially when her boyfriend is uncomfortable, makes his actions problematic.\n"
