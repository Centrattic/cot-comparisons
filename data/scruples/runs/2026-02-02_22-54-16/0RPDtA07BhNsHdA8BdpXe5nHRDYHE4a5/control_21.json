She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's been hanging out with a girl since the school year started, and he thought they were getting close. He even felt like they were moving towards a relationship. Then he found out she's actually dating someone else who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then reached out again. Now he's still pursuing her friendship, but her boyfriend is unhappy, and a friend called him creepy.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the girl has a boyfriend, and the author is continuing to pursue her. Even after finding out she's in a relationship, he's still reaching out and maintaining contact. The main question is whether that makes him the asshole.\n\nFrom the girl's perspective, she's in a committed relationship. If the author is aware of this and still pursuing a romantic or close relationship with her, that's a problem. The boyfriend looking like him doesn't change the fact that she's with someone else. The author might think there's a chance she's not fully committed, but the fact that she's in a relationship suggests she's not available. \n\nHe stopped talking to her for a few days when he found out, which could indicate he initially respected her relationship. But then he reached out again and continued the friendship. The friend's comment that he's creepy and threatening to tell the girl suggests that his actions are being seen as inappropriate. It's possible that by maintaining contact and expressing his feelings, he's crossing boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he \"loves our relationship and the time we spend together,\" which might imply he's treating the girl as if they're in a relationship, even though she's not available. The boyfriend's insecurity might stem from the author's behavior, which could be seen as a threat to the existing relationship. \n\nThe main issue here is whether it's okay to pursue someone who is already in a relationship. Generally, that's considered wrong because it can harm the existing relationship and is often seen as deceitful or manipulative. Even if the author believes there's potential for something more, the girl's commitment to her current boyfriend makes the situation ethically problematic. \n\nThe friend's reaction supports the idea that the author's actions are inappropriate. He's being advised to stop, otherwise, his friend will expose his feelings. That implies that his pursuit is not only making the boyfriend uncomfortable but also potentially violating the girl's trust and boundaries by continuing to engage with her romantically or in a way that could undermine her relationship.\n"
