She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The author feels like there's a connection and even thinks they're moving towards a relationship. The girl texts him often, and he's really into her. Then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He's hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again. He's still hanging out with her, but her boyfriend is apparently not happy about it. A friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl if he doesn't stop.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the author in the wrong here? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the girl is in a relationship. The author knew she was dating someone else after they had already been spending time together. Wait, but did he know she was dating someone before or after they started hanging out? According to the story, he didn't know about the boyfriend until after they had been hanging out. So he pursued her without knowing she was in a relationship. That might be an issue because he might have thought she was single.\n\nBut wait, the girl is in a relationship, which means she's not single. Even if the author didn't know initially, once he found out she was dating someone else, continuing to pursue her could be problematic. The author is still hanging out with her and the boyfriend is upset about it. The author's actions might be making the boyfriend uncomfortable and could interfere with their relationship.\n\nThe author's friend called him creepy for pursuing her. That suggests that the author's behavior is crossing boundaries. The girl's boyfriend is insecure because of the similarities between the author and himself. The author is maintaining a close relationship with the girl while she's in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate.\n\nEven though the author might have had feelings and thought there was mutual interest, once he discovered she was in a relationship, continuing to pursue her could be seen as the wrong thing to do. The author's actions could be interfering with the girl's current relationship and showing a lack of respect for her partner.\n\nSo putting this all together, the author is in the wrong because he continued to pursue someone who is in a relationship, despite the boyfriend's discomfort and the friend's warning. Even if the initial friendship was innocent, persisting after knowing about the relationship is problematic.\n"
