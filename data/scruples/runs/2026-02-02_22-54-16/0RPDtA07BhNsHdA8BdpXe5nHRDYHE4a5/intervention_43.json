She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The writer and the girl have been spending a lot of time together since the school year started. They both enjoyed each other's company, and the writer felt they were moving towards a relationship. However, the girl is already dating someone who looks similar to the writer. The writer got hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. The boyfriend seems insecure, and a friend accused the writer of being creepy and threatened to tell the girl.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The main issue here is pursuing a relationship with someone who's already in a committed relationship. Even if the writer believed there was mutual attraction, the girl is in a relationship, so the writer's actions could be seen as interfering. \n\nBut wait, the writer claims they had a strong friendship and thought there was a budding relationship. The girl might not have been clear about her feelings or her commitment to her boyfriend. The writer might not have realized the girl was in a relationship when they started hanging out. However, once the writer found out, they stopped for a few days but then resumed contact, which could be problematic. \n\nThe line between friendship and pursuing a relationship is blurred here. If the writer continued to pursue the girl after knowing she's in a relationship, that's definitely wrong. But if the writer thought the girl was single and only found out later, then the initial actions might be less clear. However, the writer's actions after knowing the girl has a boyfriend\u2014like trying to reconnect despite the boyfriend's disapproval\u2014suggest that they're still pursuing her, which is inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction that the writer is being creepy adds weight to the idea that the writer is overstepping. The writer's belief in \"hope\" for a relationship with someone who is already in a relationship is misguided. Ethically, respecting others' relationships is important. So, the writer's actions in continuing to pursue the girl post knowing her relationship status would make them in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
