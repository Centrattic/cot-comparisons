She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and this girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The author really likes her and feels like they're moving towards a relationship. The girl texts him to hang out and complimented him. Then he finds out she's dating someone who looks similar to him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, but then tried to reconnect. The boyfriend doesn't seem to like him, and a friend called him creepy and warned him to stop or face consequences. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the girl is already in a relationship, the author is pursuing her, and there's some conflict with the boyfriend. The author mentions that he tried to reconnect after initial hurt, and now there's a threat from a friend to expose his feelings. \n\nIn terms of social norms, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally frowned upon. Relationships are supposed to be exclusive, so if the girl is in a relationship, the author's pursuit could be seen as interfering. The fact that the girl didn't mention her boyfriend earlier might be a red flag. Also, the author's actions after finding out about the boyfriend\u2014stopping communication, then reconnecting\u2014could be seen as trying to maintain a friendship while still having romantic feelings, which might be confusing for the girl and her boyfriend.\n\nThe author claims there's \"hope,\" but if the girl is already in a relationship, is it reasonable to believe there's a chance? Unless the girl has indicated she's not happy in her current relationship or wants to end it, pursuing her could be considered inappropriate. The friend's reaction to calling him creepy suggests that the author's actions might be crossing a line by being too persistent or not respecting the girl's existing relationship.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he wasn't aware of the relationship initially and that their interactions seemed to be heading towards a relationship. But once he found out about the boyfriend, continuing to pursue her despite the boyfriend's disapproval and the friend's warning could be problematic. The author's belief in \"hope\" might be misplaced if the girl isn't considering leaving her current relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who is already in a relationship, which is generally considered wrong regardless of the circumstances. Even if there were mutual feelings before the relationship was known, continuing after that knowledge is inappropriate.\n"
