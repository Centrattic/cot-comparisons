She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo the user started hanging out with a girl from the beginning of the school year. The girl is described as fun, beautiful, etc., and he felt they were moving towards a relationship. But then he found out she's dating someone who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now he's continuing to pursue her, even though her boyfriend doesn't like him. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop or confess.\n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole (AITA). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the girl already has a boyfriend. The user is pursuing her despite that. Even if she's been friendly and they've spent time together, if she's in a relationship, pursuing her could be problematic. The user mentions she told him she loved spending time with him, but if she's already in a relationship, maybe that's not a green light. Maybe she's just being a good friend, not reciprocating romantically.\n\nHe got hurt when he found out she had a boyfriend who looks like him. But his response was to keep pursuing her after learning that. That might not be fair to either her or her boyfriend. Pursuing someone who's in a relationship can be seen as interfering, even if the user thinks there's potential. The friend's reaction calling him creepy suggests that others see this behavior as inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the user says he's in love with her and their friendship, but if she's in a relationship, continuing to pursue her could lead to complications. The boyfriend not liking him might be justified if the user is trying to get close to her despite knowing about the relationship.\n\nSo, even if the user had feelings and thought there was mutual interest, once he found out she was dating someone else, continuing to pursue her could be considered wrong. The key point is respecting her current relationship status. If she's not available, pursuing her isn't appropriate, regardless of how close they were before knowing her relationship status.\n\nTherefore, the user's actions after learning about the boyfriend might be in the wrong. Even if he's not sure why she chose her current boyfriend, he should respect her relationship and not continue to pursue her. The friend's warning about being creepy and the potential for causing issues by not stopping suggests that his behavior is indeed problematic.\n"
