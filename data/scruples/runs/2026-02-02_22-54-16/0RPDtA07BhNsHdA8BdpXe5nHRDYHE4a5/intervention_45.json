She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the guy and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. He thought they were moving towards a relationship because she texted him often and they had fun together. Then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again. He's still pursuing her despite her being in a relationship, and his friend called him creepy for not coming clean.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the guy thought there was a possibility of a relationship, but then realized she was with someone else. He continued to pursue her after that. \n\nIn most ethical and social contexts, pursuing someone who is in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong. Even if both parties might have feelings, it's not respectful to the existing partner. The guy's actions could be seen as trying to interfere or take advantage of a situation where the girl is already involved with someone else. Also, the fact that he keeps hanging out and pursuing her despite the boyfriend's disapproval shows a lack of consideration for the boyfriend's feelings and the girl's relationship status.\n\nThe argument that he's not in the wrong might come from his perspective of feeling rejected or thinking there was a mutual interest. But objectively, the girl is not single, so pursuing her could be seen as unethical. The friend calling him creepy supports that others view his actions negatively. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally not acceptable.\n"
