She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the author started hanging out with a girl since the school year began. They describe her as fun, beautiful, etc., and felt like they were moving towards a relationship. The girl texted him often, and he thought they had mutual feelings. Then he found out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He got hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then reached out again. Now he's continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship, even when her boyfriend is uncomfortable. His friend called him creepy and threatened to expose his feelings if he didn't stop.\n\nSo, the key points here: the girl is in a relationship. The author kept pursuing her after learning about her boyfriend. The friend's reaction indicates that the author's actions might be seen as inappropriate or intrusive. The author's belief in \"hope\" for a relationship might be ignoring the reality that she's already committed.\n\nEthically, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong. It can be seen as disrespectful to the current partner and potentially manipulative if the person is trying to interfere. The author's actions could be hurting all parties involved: the girl, her boyfriend, and even the author himself if the relationship doesn't materialize. \n\nThe author might be in denial about the girl's feelings. Just because she was friendly or spent time with him doesn't mean she's interested in leaving her current relationship. The fact that her boyfriend resembles the author might be a red flag he's ignoring\u2014maybe she's with her boyfriend for valid reasons, and the author's pursuit is unwarranted.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a warning sign. Calling him creepy and threatening to tell the girl suggests that the author's behavior is socially unacceptable. The author's persistence despite the boyfriend's discomfort adds to the problem. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because he's continuing to pursue a relationship with someone who's already committed, which is generally considered unethical and potentially harmful. The answer should be A.\n"
