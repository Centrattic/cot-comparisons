She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The question is whether their actions make them the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, the author admits they've been hanging out with the girl since the school year started. They mention she's fun, beautiful, and they felt like they were moving towards a relationship. The girl also said nice things about them. But then the author finds out she's dating someone else who looks like them and is in the same dorm. The author gets hurt, stops talking to her, then tries to reconnect. They continue to hang out despite the boyfriend's disapproval. A friend calls them creepy and threatens to tell the girl about their feelings.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author pursuing someone who's already in a relationship. Even if the author believed there was a mutual emotional connection, the girl is with someone else. The author's actions could be seen as interfering in an existing relationship, which is generally considered wrong. The friend's comment about being creepy suggests that the author's behavior might be crossing boundaries. The fact that the boyfriend doesn't like them and is insecure might also indicate that the author's presence is causing tension in the relationship. \n\nEven if the author feels there's a connection, it's not appropriate to pursue someone while they're in a committed relationship. The girl's loyalty is to her boyfriend, and the author's actions could be seen as manipulation or encouragement of emotional infidelity. The author might need to step back and respect the girl's current relationship instead of trying to push for a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the girl led them on by being affectionate and spending time together. But the key point here is that the girl is already in a relationship, so the responsibility is on the author to recognize that and not continue pursuing her. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're pursuing someone who's not available, which could be considered unethical and disrespectful towards both the girl and her boyfriend.\n"
