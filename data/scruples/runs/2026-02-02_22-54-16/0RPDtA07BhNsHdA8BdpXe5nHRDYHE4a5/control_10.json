She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is described as they've been hanging out a lot, and the author thought there was potential for a relationship. Then he found out she's dating someone who looks similar, which is confusing for him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing someone who's already committed. Even if they were close friends and had a good time, the fact remains that she's with someone else. The author is expressing feelings and continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship. That seems like a problem because it could be seen as disrespectful to her current partner.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that after finding out, he stopped talking to her for a few days but then resumed hanging out. The boyfriend doesn't like him, which adds tension. The friend even called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl about his feelings. That's a red flag. If someone else perceives the behavior as creepy, it's worth considering if the actions are appropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the author's belief that there's \"hope.\" But if the girl is with someone else, it's not about hope; it's about respecting her current relationship. Pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can lead to jealousy, breakups, and hurt feelings. The author might not be realizing that the girl's feelings towards him might not be reciprocated beyond friendship, especially since she chose someone else.\n\nHowever, the author might feel that their interactions were leading somewhere, but the girl's actions (dating someone else) indicate she's not interested. The line between friendship and pursuing a relationship can be blurry, but once it's clear the person is in a relationship, continuing to pursue them is usually seen as inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who's already in a relationship, which is disrespectful. The friend's reaction also supports that there's an issue with his behavior. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
