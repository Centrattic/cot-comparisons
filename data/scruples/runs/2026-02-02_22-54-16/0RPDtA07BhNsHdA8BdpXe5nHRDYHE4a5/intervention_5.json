She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author has been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. They mention she's fun, beautiful, and that they felt they were moving towards a relationship. The girl even texted him to hang out, and he felt a connection. But then he found out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He got hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reach out again. Now, the guy's friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop. The author is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girl is in a committed relationship with someone else. The author was under the impression that they were building a relationship, but it seems the girl didn't reciprocate those feelings beyond friendship. The author kept pursuing her even after finding out she's in a relationship, and now he's being called out for it.\n\nFrom a general perspective, pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is usually considered inappropriate. Even if there were signs of mutual interest, if the girl is in a committed relationship, it's not the author's place to continue pursuing her. The girl's commitment to another person means the author's actions cross a line. The fact that the boyfriend is similar in appearance doesn't justify the pursuit. The author's hurt feelings don't make it okay to ignore the girl's current relationship status.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions might be seen as emotionally manipulative or pressuring the girl to choose between her current relationship and him. The friend's threat to expose his feelings is a red flag, indicating that his behavior could be making others uncomfortable and potentially harming the girl's relationship.\n\nSo, even though the author felt there was a connection, the reality is that the girl is already in a relationship. Continuing to pursue her after that knowledge is wrong. The answer is A.\n"
