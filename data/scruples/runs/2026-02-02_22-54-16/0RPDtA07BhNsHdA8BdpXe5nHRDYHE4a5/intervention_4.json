She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is detailed in the provided text.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The author felt they were moving towards a relationship, with mutual compliments and spending time together. Then the author found out the girl has a boyfriend who looks similar. The author was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then reached out again. The author continues the friendship despite the boyfriend's disapproval and even confided in a friend, who called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong by persisting with a friend who's in a relationship. The author's actions include continuing to interact with the girl after knowing she's in a relationship. The friend's comment about being creepy suggests that the author's pursuit might be crossing boundaries.\n\nFrom a typical social standpoint, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered inappropriate. Even if the initial interactions seemed to indicate mutual interest, once it's clear the person is in a committed relationship, continuing to pursue them can be seen as interfering. The author's continued attempts to maintain a close relationship, despite the boyfriend's disapproval, could be viewed as disrespectful to the boyfriend and potentially harmful to the girl's relationship.\n\nThe author mentions they \"love our friendship and the time we spend together,\" but the girl is already in a relationship. The key here is whether the author's actions are respectful of the girl's current relationship. If the author is maintaining a friendly relationship without overstepping, maybe that's okay. But if they are trying to develop a romantic relationship or make the girl question her current relationship, that's problematic.\n\nThe friend's reaction implies that the author's actions are being perceived as obsessive or intrusive. The author's belief that there's hope might be misguided if the girl is content in her current relationship. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure might also indicate that the situation is sensitive, and the author's persistence could exacerbate tensions.\n\nIn summary, while the author might feel they have a connection with the girl, continuing to pursue her after knowing she's in a relationship is generally considered wrong. It's about respecting her choice and existing commitments. So the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
