She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The story says that the girl and the author were hanging out a lot, and they both seemed to enjoy each other's company. The author felt they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out she's dating someone else who looks similar. The author got hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now they're hanging out again, but the boyfriend is uncomfortable, and a friend called the author creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that the girl is already in a relationship. Even if both the author and the girl were building a connection, the fact remains that she's with someone else. The author might have misread the signals, thinking they were moving towards a relationship, but if she's already in a committed relationship, then pursuing her would be wrong regardless of how things looked before.\n\nAlso, after finding out about the boyfriend, the author decided to continue pursuing her despite the boyfriend's discomfort. That seems problematic. Even if the author believed there was hope, they should respect the girl's current relationship. The friend's warning about being creepy and the threat to tell the girl adds to the concern. The author's actions could be seen as inappropriate because they're interfering in an existing relationship, which is generally considered wrong. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
