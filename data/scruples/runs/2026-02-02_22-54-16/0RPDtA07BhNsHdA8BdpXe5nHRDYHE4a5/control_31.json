She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person has been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. They both seem to have mutual feelings, but the girl is actually dating someone else who looks similar. The author got hurt when finding out and stopped talking for a few days. Then they reached out again, continued the friendship, but the boyfriend is uncomfortable. Now, a friend called the author creepy for pursuing the girl.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the girl is already in a relationship. The author thought there was a chance they could be together, but the girl chose to date someone else even though she was spending time with the author. The author is continuing to pursue the girl despite her being in a relationship. \n\nIn most social norms, pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as interfering in their relationship. Even if the girl is spending time with the author, she's chosen to date someone else. The author's actions might be making the boyfriend uncomfortable, which is a valid concern. The author's friend called them creepy, which suggests that their behavior is crossing boundaries.\n\nThe author mentions they \"love our relationship\" which might imply that they still see the girl as theirs or that they want to be in a relationship with her. Continuing to pursue someone who is in a relationship can be seen as disrespectful to the girl's current partner and can potentially hurt everyone involved. Even if the author believes there's \"hope,\" if the girl is in a committed relationship, it's not the author's place to pursue her if she's not breaking up with her boyfriend. \n\nThe author might have misread the signals from the girl. Just because the girl spends time with them and says nice things doesn't necessarily mean she's not committed to her boyfriend. It's possible the girl is leading the author on, which would make the author's pursuit even more problematic. The author's actions could be causing emotional harm and creating tension between them and the boyfriend. \n\nThe friend threatening to tell the girl about the author's feelings indicates that the author's behavior is becoming inappropriate and might be making others uncomfortable. The author needs to consider that continuing this pursuit could damage their friendship with the girl and the boyfriend if things go further. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because they are pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship, which is generally not acceptable. The author should respect the girl's current relationship and step back to avoid further complications.\n"
