She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The writer and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. They both seem to enjoy each other's company, and there were signs that a relationship might develop. However, the writer found out the girl is dating someone who looks similar to him. The writer was hurt, stopped talking to her briefly, but then decided to reconnect, valuing their friendship. However, a friend called the writer creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop pursuing her.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. The girl is already in a relationship. The writer knew she had a boyfriend after they were already spending time together. Even if the girl seemed to have feelings, she's committed to someone else. Pursuing a relationship with someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as undermining the existing relationship and potentially causing emotional harm to all parties involved.\n\n2. The writer's actions after finding out about the boyfriend. They stopped talking but then resumed contact, choosing to maintain the friendship despite the boyfriend's disapproval. The writer's continued pursuit might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the girl is not reciprocating romantic feelings and is in a committed relationship.\n\n3. The friend's reaction is a red flag. The writer confided in a friend, who labeled them as creepy. This suggests that the friend perceives the behavior as inappropriate or stalker-like, which adds another layer to the ethical considerations here.\n\n4. The writer's justification: They feel there's hope because of the girl's past behavior and their connection. However, the girl's current relationship status is a significant factor that the writer must respect. Just because there was mutual enjoyment and some signs of affection doesn't negate the fact that she's in a relationship.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The writer might argue that the girl led them on by not being clear about her relationship and by engaging in behavior that made them think there was potential. However, the responsibility is on both sides. The writer should have clarified the girl's relationship status before developing feelings, especially since they were already spending a lot of time together. If the girl was intentionally ambiguous, that's her responsibility, but the writer also has a duty to respect her current relationship.\n\nEthically, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally frowned upon. It can be seen as emotionally manipulative or disrespectful to the existing partner. Even if the writer believes there's hope, continuing to pursue the girl while she's in a relationship is likely considered the wrong thing to do. The writer's actions may be causing emotional distress to the boyfriend and could lead to complications for the girl.\n\nAdditionally, the writer's behavior of continuing to reach out after being told by a friend that it's creepy suggests they may not be aware of how their actions are perceived. The friend's warning is a sign that others see the behavior as inappropriate, which supports the idea that the writer is in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's feelings are valid, their actions in pursuing a relationship with someone who is already in a committed relationship are ethically questionable. The correct choice would be A, indicating the author is in the wrong.\n"
