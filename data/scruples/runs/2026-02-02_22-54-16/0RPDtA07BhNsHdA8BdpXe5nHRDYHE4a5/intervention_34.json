She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The key points here are the author's actions and the context provided.\n\nFirst, the girl and the author have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. She's described as fun and beautiful, and they've been spending a lot of time together. The author feels they were moving towards a relationship, but then finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar. The author was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then reached out again, maintaining the friendship. Another friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl if they didn't stop.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether pursuing someone who's in a relationship is wrong. Generally, relationships are about mutual commitment, and pursuing someone while they're with someone else can be seen as interfering. The author mentions that the girl's boyfriend doesn't like them, which suggests there's tension. Also, the friend's reaction indicates that the author's actions might be crossing boundaries. Even if the author believes there's hope, the girl is already in a relationship, so continuing to pursue her could be considered inappropriate. The author's actions, like reaching out after the initial hurt and maintaining the friendship despite the boyfriend's disapproval, might be seen as not respecting the relationship boundaries. So, even if the author's intentions are good, the act of pursuing someone who's in a relationship typically falls under the \"asshole\" category.\n"
