She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is presented through an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) format, so the question is about whether the author's actions are justifiable.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the start of the school year. The author feels they're building a relationship and develops feelings, even getting excited when she texts him. Then he finds out she's dating someone similar to him. He feels hurt, stops talking for a few days, then reaches out again. He continues to pursue the friendship despite the boyfriend's disapproval, and a friend calls him creepy for hiding his feelings.\n\nThe author's actions involve pursuing a girl who's in a relationship. Even if they were close friends and he feels there's mutual affection, the girl is already in a relationship. The author's continued pursuit could be seen as inappropriate because it interferes with her existing relationship. The fact that he expressed feelings and maybe the friend found it creepy might indicate he crossed a boundary. The boyfriend's dislike and insecurity also suggest the author's presence is causing tension.\n\nIn many cultures, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can undermine the other person's commitment. Even if the author believes there's \"hope\" or thinks the relationship isn't working, he should respect her current relationship status. The girl hasn't reciprocated the feelings in a way that indicates she's open to a relationship with him, so the author's actions might be seen as persistent and not respecting her choice.\n\nThe friend's reaction adds another layer\u2014calling him creepy implies that his behavior is overstepping. The author might not realize that continuing to pursue despite the boyfriend's presence is problematic. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who's already in a relationship, which is generally considered unethical and could be seen as disrespectful to both the girl and her boyfriend.\n"
