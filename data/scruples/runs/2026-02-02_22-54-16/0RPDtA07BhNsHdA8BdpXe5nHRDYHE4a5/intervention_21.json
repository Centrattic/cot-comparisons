She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've been hanging out with the girl since the school year started. They describe her as fun, beautiful, and that they have a good connection. He feels like they're moving towards a relationship. Then he finds out she's dating someone who looks like him. He's hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, but then reaches out again. He continues to hang out and even says he loves their friendship. However, his friend labels him as creepy and threatens to tell the girl if he doesn't stop.\n\nSo the key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the author is pursuing her despite that, the boyfriend is uncomfortable with the author's presence, and the friend thinks the author is being creepy.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, pursuing someone who is in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as interfering with their relationship and being disrespectful to the boyfriend. The author is continuing to engage with the girl after knowing she's in a relationship, which could be seen as inappropriate regardless of his feelings.\n\nEven if the author believes there was a mutual connection, once the relationship status is known, maintaining that connection could be problematic. The fact that the boyfriend is uncomfortable and the friend calls him creepy adds to the concern. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they do cross ethical boundaries by not respecting the girlfriend's relationship status.\n\nThe author's justification is his affection for the girl and wanting to maintain the friendship. However, friendships with someone in a relationship typically don't include romantic pursuit. The line between friendship and something more is blurred here, especially when it's known that the person is taken. The author's continued pursuit after knowing her relationship status is where the issue lies.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's pursuing a girl who is in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful to the boyfriend.\n"
