She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has been spending a lot of time with a girl who's already in a relationship. They both seemed to enjoy each other's company, but when the author found out the girl was dating someone else who looks like him, he got hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days. Then he decided to reach out again, even though the boyfriend is apparently uncomfortable with his presence. Now a friend is calling him creepy and wants him to stop or confess his feelings.\n\nFirst, let me break this down. The girl has a boyfriend. The author is pursuing her despite that. The guy in the dorm is her boyfriend, so the author is involved in a situation where the girl isn't available. The author's actions might be seen as crossing boundaries because the girl is in a committed relationship. Even if the girl was leading the author on, the author is still continuing to pursue her, which isn't okay. The fact that the boyfriend looks similar might add to the confusion, but that doesn't excuse the author's behavior.\n\nThe author mentions that the girl told him great things and they were spending a lot of time together. But if she's in a relationship, even if she's showing interest, it's not appropriate for him to keep pursuing her. The author's actions after finding out about the boyfriend\u2014stopping contact and then resuming\u2014might be seen as emotional manipulation or trying to create a situation where he can be with her. Also, the boyfriend's insecurity is a red flag because the author's presence could be causing tension in the boyfriend's relationship. \n\nThe friend's warning that he's creepy and threatening to tell the girl unless he stops or confesses suggests that the author's behavior is not acceptable. If the author keeps pursuing the girl despite knowing she's in a relationship, that's being inconsiderate of her current commitments and possibly violating the boyfriend's trust. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might be misplaced if the girl isn't interested in ending her current relationship. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in the wrong because he's persistently pursuing someone who is in a relationship. Even if there were some mutual feelings before the truth came out, once the author knew about the boyfriend, continuing to pursue her would be inappropriate. The fact that the boyfriend exists and the author is creating conflict in their relationship makes the author's actions problematic. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
