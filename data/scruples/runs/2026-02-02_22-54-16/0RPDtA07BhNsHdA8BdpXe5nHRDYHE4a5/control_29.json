She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girl and the author have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The author feels like they were moving towards a relationship because the girl texted him to hang out and said nice things. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again. He also mentions that her boyfriend doesn't like him, and a friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl.\n\nSo, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The author is continuing to pursue her even after she's in a committed relationship. Even though he thought there was a connection, once he knew she was dating someone else, he should have respected her relationship. Pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can lead to emotional harm for everyone involved. The fact that her boyfriend is similar to him doesn't change the fact that she's with someone else now. The friend calling him creepy might indicate that his actions are crossing boundaries. Also, continuing to pursue her despite the boyfriend's disapproval suggests he's not respecting her relationship. So, the author is in the wrong here because he's not respecting her current relationship status.\n"
