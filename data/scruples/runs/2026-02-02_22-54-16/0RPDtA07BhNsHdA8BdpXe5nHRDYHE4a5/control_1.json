She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author has been spending a lot of time with this girl. They mention she's fun, beautiful, and they felt a connection. The girl also texted him to hang out and said nice things. But then he found out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her, then tried to reconnect. Now her friend is calling him creepy if he doesn't confess or stop.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the author is continuing to pursue her despite that, and he's being accused of being creepy. The main issue is whether pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship is wrong.\n\nI know that in most social contexts, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is considered inappropriate. Even if the person isn't aware they're being pursued, if you know they're with someone else, continuing to show romantic interest could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author's actions might be leading the girl's boyfriend to feel threatened, which adds another layer. The friend threatening to tell the girl suggests that the author's behavior is being viewed negatively by others.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he believes there's a connection and that the girl might prefer him over her current boyfriend. But just because he feels a connection doesn't mean it's right to pursue her when she's already committed. The girl might not reciprocate his feelings once she knows about her boyfriend, so his assumption that there's hope could be misguided.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's trying to maintain a friendship while having romantic feelings complicates things. It's possible he's misinterpreting her actions as signs of interest, when she's just being friendly. The author's actions could be leading to emotional harm for everyone involved, including the boyfriend, the girl, and himself.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who's already in a relationship, which is generally considered disrespectful. The friend's reaction supports that perspective. Even if he's not intentionally trying to break them up, his actions can still be seen as inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
