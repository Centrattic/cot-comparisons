She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and the girl have been hanging out since the school year started. They mention that she's fun, beautiful, and that they have a good connection. The author felt they were moving towards a relationship and even mentions that the girl told them she loved spending time with them. But then they found out the girl has a boyfriend who looks similar to them. The author was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then reached out again. Now, the boyfriend doesn't like them, and the author's friend called them creepy and threatened to expose their feelings if they didn't stop.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the author was previously close but didn't realize she was dating someone else, and then continued pursuing her after finding out. The author's friend is concerned because they might be crossing boundaries by continuing to pursue someone who's already in a relationship.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. Dating someone who's in a relationship is generally considered unethical because it can lead to emotional harm and betrayal. The author's actions might be seen as interfering in an existing relationship. Even if the author thought there was mutual interest before knowing about the boyfriend, once they found out, continuing to pursue her could be problematic. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure and dislikes the author suggests that the author's presence is causing tension. The friend's reaction also points to the idea that the author is overstepping by not respecting the girl's current relationship status.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they didn't know about the relationship initially and were genuinely interested. But once they knew, continuing to pursue her without considering her relationship is where the issue lies. The question is whether the author's actions after knowing about the boyfriend are wrong. In most social contexts, pursuing someone who is already in a committed relationship is frowned upon, regardless of initial intentions.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be yes, the author is in the wrong for continuing to pursue a girl who's in a relationship, even if there were previous signs of mutual interest. The key point is respecting her relationship status once it's known.\n"
