She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that he's been hanging out with a girl since the school year started, and he thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then he found out she has a boyfriend who looks like him. He felt hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days but then reached out again. Now he's continuing to hang out with her, even though her boyfriend doesn't like him. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl already has a boyfriend. The author thought there was a mutual romantic interest, but that's not the case. The girl is in a committed relationship, so pursuing her while she's in a relationship could be problematic.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014like continuing to pursue her even after knowing she's dating someone else\u2014could be seen as interfering in an existing relationship. The fact that the boyfriend is similar in appearance might not matter because the main issue is that she's in a relationship. The author might be under the impression that there's a chance for a relationship, but the girl hasn't expressed any interest in ending her current relationship.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is a red flag. The author confessed his feelings to someone else, which might not be appropriate. The friend's threat suggests that the author's behavior is being viewed as inappropriate or overstepping boundaries.\n\nSo, even though the author feels he's not in the wrong, the reality is that pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong. The author is continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship, which can be hurtful to the current partner and may not be reciprocated by the girl. The key issue is the existing relationship. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
