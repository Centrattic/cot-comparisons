She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the girl and the author have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. They both seem to enjoy each other's company, and there were signs of mutual interest. The author felt they were moving towards a relationship. But then it's revealed the girl is dating someone else who looks similar to the author. The author was hurt, stopped talking to her, then tried to reconnect. The boyfriend is reportedly uncomfortable with the author, and a friend warns the author that their actions are creepy.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the girl is in a committed relationship, and the author is pursuing her despite that. Even if there were signs of mutual interest, once it's known she's dating someone, continuing to pursue her could be seen as crossing a line. The author's friend calls them creepy, which is a strong accusation. The author's actions might be infringing on the boyfriend's relationship boundaries. Even if the author believes there's potential, the presence of a boyfriend makes the situation ethically complex. The author's justification is that they \"love our relationship and the time we spend together,\" but if that relationship is with someone who is in a relationship, it's problematic. The author might be ignoring the girl's current commitments and the boyfriend's feelings. So, even if the author had good intentions initially, continuing after knowing she's in a relationship might make them at fault. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because pursuing a friend who is in a relationship can be considered inappropriate, regardless of the initial signs of mutual interest.\n"
