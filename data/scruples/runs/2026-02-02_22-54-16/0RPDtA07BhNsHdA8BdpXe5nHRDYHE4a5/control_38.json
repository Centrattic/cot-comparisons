She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot, both seemed to have feelings, but then the girl is already dating someone who looks similar. The author got hurt, stopped talking, then tried to reconnect. Now there's a friend threatening to tell the girl about his feelings if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, the girl is in a relationship. The author knew she had a boyfriend but kept pursuing her. Even if they had a close friendship and mutual affection, the girl is committed to someone else. Continuing to pursue someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as disrespectful to both the partner and the person they're pursuing. The author's actions might be making the boyfriend uncomfortable, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nThe author mentions that they stopped talking for a few days but then resumed hanging out. That shows they didn't completely cut off contact. However, continuing to spend time and express feelings toward someone who's in a relationship crosses boundaries. The friend calling them creepy suggests that the pursuit is not appropriate. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might be ignoring the reality that the girl is already in a relationship. \n\nEven if the girl reciprocated feelings, pursuing her while she's with someone else is ethically questionable. The author's actions could lead to emotional harm, whether to the boyfriend or the girl herself if the relationship was already complicated. The key point here is that respecting a person's current relationship is important. The author's actions might be seen as selfish, not considering the girlfriend's commitment and the existing relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A). They're pursuing someone who's in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate and could be harmful.\n"
