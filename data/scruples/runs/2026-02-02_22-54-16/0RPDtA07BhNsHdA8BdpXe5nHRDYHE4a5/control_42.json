She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person has been hanging out with a girl since the start of the school year. They found her attractive, fun, and they had a good time together. The girl also seemed to like spending time with him. Then he found out she's dating someone else who looks just like him. He was really hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days but then reached out again. Now he's pursuing her friendship despite her being in a relationship, and a friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl unless he stops.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the girl is already in a relationship. The author is continuing to pursue her, even after knowing she has a boyfriend. The fact that the boyfriend looks similar might make the author feel like he's being replaced, but that doesn't justify pursuing a relationship with someone who is already taken. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole. The main issue is whether it's wrong to pursue a girl who is in a relationship. Generally, relationships are exclusive, so if someone is in a committed relationship, pursuing them could be seen as interfering or being inconsiderate. The author mentions that the girl's boyfriend is uncomfortable with him, which might indicate that the boyfriend feels threatened or that the author's actions are inappropriate.\n\nEven if the author and the girl were close before the boyfriend came into the picture, once the girl is in a relationship, the author's continued pursuit could be seen as crossing a boundary. The fact that the friend called him creepy suggests that others might view his actions as inappropriate. Also, the author's belief that there's still \"hope\" implies he's not respecting the existing relationship.\n\nThe girl might not have reciprocated his feelings in a romantic way because she's already in a relationship. The author might be misinterpreting her friendliness as romantic interest. Pursuing someone who is in a relationship can be considered wrong because it can lead to emotional harm for all parties involved. The boyfriend could feel betrayed, and the girl might be caught in a difficult position.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is indeed in the wrong for continuing to pursue a girl who is already in a relationship, despite knowing her boyfriend exists and his discomfort. His actions could be seen as creepy and respectful boundaries are not being maintained.\n"
