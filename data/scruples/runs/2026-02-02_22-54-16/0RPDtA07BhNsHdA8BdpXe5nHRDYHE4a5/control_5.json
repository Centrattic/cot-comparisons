She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girl and the author have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The girl seems to enjoy his company, texting him to hang out, and even compliments him. The author feels they're moving towards a relationship. However, he later finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then tries to reconnect. He's still pursuing her despite her being in a relationship, and a friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl about his feelings.\n\nKey points here: The girl is already in a relationship. The author is pursuing her even after knowing this. The boyfriend looks like the author, but that's probably not relevant. The main issue is that the author is trying to get close to someone who is not single. \n\nIn many cultures, pursuing someone who's in a committed relationship is considered wrong. It's often seen as interfering and can cause emotional harm. Even if the girl is friendly, the author's actions might be crossing a line. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior is socially unacceptable. The author might be under the impression that there's a chance for the girl to leave her boyfriend, but that's not his decision to make. He should respect her current relationship status. \n\nAlso, the author is continuing to engage with her despite the boyfriend's disapproval, which adds another layer of conflict. The friend's threat implies that the author's persistence is making others uncomfortable and potentially violating boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because he's pursuing a relationship with someone who is already committed, which is generally considered disrespectful and inappropriate.\n"
