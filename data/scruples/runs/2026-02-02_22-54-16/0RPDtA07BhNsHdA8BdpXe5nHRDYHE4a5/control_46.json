She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The situation is that the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot this school year, and they both seemed to enjoy each other's company. The girl even said nice things about him, which made the author feel like they were moving towards a relationship. Then the author found out she's dating someone else who looks very similar to him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, his friend is calling him creepy and threatening to tell the girl about his feelings.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong. Let me break this down. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing her while she's with someone else. In most social norms, that's considered inappropriate. Even if the girl seems to enjoy his company, she's already committed to another person. The author's actions might not be respectful of her current relationship. The fact that the guy looks similar adds a layer here, but that doesn't justify the author's pursuit. The author's friend is concerned enough to call him creepy and warn him to stop. Also, the boyfriend seems to dislike him, which could be a sign of tension. The author's belief that there's still hope might be ignoring the reality that she's in a relationship. Even though the girl might have feelings for him, acting on them when she's with someone else is problematic. The author might be overstepping boundaries, and the girl's actions (continuing to hang out after she knows he's interested) could be just as much an issue. But the main point is, the author is pursuing someone who is not available, which is generally seen as wrong. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
