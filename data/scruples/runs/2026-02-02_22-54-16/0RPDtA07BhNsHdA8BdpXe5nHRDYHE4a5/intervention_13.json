She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the girl they're interested in is dating someone else. The writer mentions that they've been hanging out a lot and thought there was a mutual attraction. They even felt like a relationship was forming. Then they found out she's dating someone similar to them, which made them hurt. They stopped talking, then tried to reconnect, and now they're continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship. A friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl if they didn't stop.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the writer is continuing to pursue her, and they're ignoring the friend's warning. From a social standpoint, pursuing someone who's already in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can interfere with the existing relationship and is disrespectful to all parties involved. The writer's friend's reaction suggests that this behavior is not acceptable. Even if the writer believes there's hope, the girl is committed to someone else, so pursuing her could be seen as unethical or inappropriate.\n\nThe writer might feel they're not in the wrong because they thought there was mutual interest, but the fact remains that the girl is with someone else. The writer should respect her current relationship and not continue pursuing her. The fact that the boyfriend is similar in appearance doesn't justify the actions. The writer's actions could be causing emotional harm and complicating the girl's relationship. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're engaging in behavior that's not respectful of the girl's current commitments.\n"
