She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The situation is about feelings and interactions between people, so I need to analyze the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the girl and the author were hanging out a lot, and the author felt they were moving towards a relationship. But then the author found out she's dating someone else who looks similar. The key points here are: the girl is in a committed relationship, the author knew about it but kept pursuing her, and even after being called out as creepy, the author still wants to continue the friendship or more.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong. The girl's boyfriend is in the picture, and the author's actions could be seen as interfering. Even if the author believes there was a connection before the boyfriend, once it's known that the girl is committed, continuing to pursue her is inappropriate. The author's friend called them creepy, which suggests that others see the behavior as unacceptable. Also, the author's insistence on maintaining the relationship despite the boyfriend's disapproval adds to the problem.\n\nThe author might argue that they thought there was mutual interest, but the reality is that the girl is in a relationship. The line between friendship and pursuing a relationship is crossed here. The fact that the author is still trying to maintain closeness after being confronted could be seen as not respecting the girl's current relationship. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
