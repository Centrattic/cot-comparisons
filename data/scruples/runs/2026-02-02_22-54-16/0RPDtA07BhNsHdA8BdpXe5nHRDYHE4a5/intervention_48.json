She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship but they've been hanging out a lot. The girl seems to like the author, but she's dating someone else. The author is confused and hurt because he thought there was a chance they could be together. After finding out about her boyfriend, he stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The girl is in a relationship, so even if she's spending time with the author, she's not free to be in a relationship with him. The author is continuing to pursue her despite her being in a committed relationship. That's a red flag. Even if the girl reciprocates some feelings, she's already in a relationship, so pursuing her could be seen as interfering. The author is trying to maintain a friendship, but the context of her being in a relationship complicates things. The friend's reaction is another point\u2014calling him creepy and threatening to expose his feelings suggests that his actions might be crossing boundaries.\n\nThe author's actions might be considered wrong because he's not respecting the girl's relationship status. Even if he thought there was mutual interest, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered unethical. The fact that he continued to reach out and maintain contact could be seen as inappropriate. His justification is that he loves their friendship, but if that's leading to romantic feelings, it's problematic. The friend's warning indicates that others see his behavior as creepy, which supports the idea that he's overstepping.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author might feel he's not at fault, the ethical standard here is that pursuing someone who's in a relationship is wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
