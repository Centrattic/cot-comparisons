She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has been hanging out with a girl since school started, felt there was a budding relationship, but then found out she's already dating someone who looks like him. The author was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, a friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl unless they stop pursuing her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the author is pursuing her despite her being in a relationship, and the author is trying to maintain a friendship while having feelings. The author's actions might be considered morally wrong because they are pursuing someone who is already in a committed relationship. Even if the girl is being affectionate, if she's in a relationship, then the author's pursuit could be seen as interfering or not respecting her current relationship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girl's boyfriend looks similar to them, which might add to the confusion. But that doesn't excuse the behavior. The main issue is that the girl is in a relationship, so the author's pursuit is problematic. The fact that the author is trying to maintain a friendship while having romantic feelings could lead to complications. The friend's threat suggests that the author's actions are making others uncomfortable, which might indicate that their behavior is indeed inappropriate.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to check if that's the case. From a moral standpoint, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can cause harm to the existing relationship and is disrespectful. Even if the girl is open to the attention, the author's pursuit is still inconsiderate of her boyfriend's feelings and her own committed relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
