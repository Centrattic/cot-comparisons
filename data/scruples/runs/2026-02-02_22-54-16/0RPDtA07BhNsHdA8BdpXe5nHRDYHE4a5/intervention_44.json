She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person has been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. They describe her as fun, beautiful, and that they have a good connection. The girl texts them often, and they felt like they were moving towards a relationship. Then they found out she's dating someone else who looks like them, which causes them to feel hurt and stop talking to her for a few days. After that, they try to reconnect and continue hanging out, but the boyfriend is uncomfortable. Another friend calls them creepy and threatens to tell the girl if they don't stop.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is whether pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship is wrong. The person isn't in the relationship, but they thought there was a possibility. However, the girl is already dating someone else. So even if they felt there was mutual attraction, if the girl is in a committed relationship, then pursuing her would be problematic. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's break it down. The key points are: the girl has a boyfriend. The author is continuing to interact with her despite the boyfriend's disapproval. The friend called them creepy for not stopping. \n\nEven if the author thought there was a chance the girl might be interested, once they knew she was in a relationship, pursuing her could be seen as interfering. Also, the boyfriend's discomfort suggests that the author's actions might be causing tension in the existing relationship. \n\nThe author's justification is that they love the friendship and the time together. But if the girl is in a committed relationship, the author's actions could be considered inappropriate. The term \"pursuing\" implies trying to build a relationship with someone who is already taken, which is generally considered wrong because it can undermine the existing partnership. \n\nAdditionally, the author's friend is concerned and calls them creepy, which might indicate that their behavior crosses boundaries. Even if the girl doesn't object, the fact that she's in a relationship means the author's pursuit is ethically questionable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is more likely A (the author is in the wrong). They are pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship, which is generally frowned upon. Even if they have feelings, respecting the existing relationship is important. Continuing to interact and express feelings could be seen as inappropriate and potentially harmful.\n"
