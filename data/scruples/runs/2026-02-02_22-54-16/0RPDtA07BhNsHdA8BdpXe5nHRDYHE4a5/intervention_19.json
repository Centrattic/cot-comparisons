She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and the author felt like there was a budding relationship. Then they found out the girl is dating someone else who looks similar. The author is hurt but continues to interact with her, even after being told they might be creepy. The friend then warns them to stop or else.\n\nThe key points here are about respecting boundaries. The girl is in a relationship, so she's committed to someone else. The author is continuing to pursue her despite that. Even if the author thinks there's a connection, the girl is already in a relationship, which means the author is essentially trying to interfere or create a situation where there's no mutual consent. \n\nThe author mentions that they stopped talking for a few days but then resumed. The fact that her boyfriend is reportedly insecure and dislikes the author suggests that the author's actions might be making the boyfriend uncomfortable, which isn't good either. Also, the friend called them creepy, which is a strong warning sign. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered inappropriate because it can create emotional harm and disrupt an existing relationship. The author might not be malicious, but their actions are disregarding the girl's current commitment. Even if the girl is open to the friendship, the author's feelings and actions could be complicating her relationship and causing tension. \n\nThe author's belief that there's \"hope\" isn't valid if the girl is in a relationship. It's possible that the girl isn't interested in ending her relationship, and the author's persistence could be seen as pressuring her. The fact that the friend intervened and called them creepy indicates that others around them see a problem with the behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting in a way that's not respecting the girl's relationship status and potentially creating a hostile environment for both her and her boyfriend. Even if feelings are mutual in some way, the existing relationship is the key factor here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
