She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot, both had positive feelings, but then the author finds out she's dating someone else who looks like him. The author was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then reached out again, and is now continuing their friendship despite the boyfriend's disapproval. A friend calls the author creepy.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The author's actions involve pursuing someone who's committed to another person. Even if both parties had mutual positive feelings before the author knew about the boyfriend, once the boyfriend exists, pursuing the girl could be considered interfering in an existing relationship. The author is in a situation where the girl is not available, so continuing to pursue her might be crossing a boundary. \n\nThe author mentions that they're still friends and hanging out, but the boyfriend's disapproval is a red flag. The fact that the author confessed feelings to a friend and might be spreading this around could also be problematic. The friend's reaction that they're \"creepy\" suggests that the actions are socially unacceptable. \n\nEven if the author felt there was mutual interest, once the relationship is known, the pursuit becomes ethically questionable. The author's insistence on continuing the pursuit despite the boyfriend's presence and disapproval shows a lack of respect for the existing relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
