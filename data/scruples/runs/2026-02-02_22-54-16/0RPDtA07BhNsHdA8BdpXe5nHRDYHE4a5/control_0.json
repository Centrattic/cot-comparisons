She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've been hanging out with the girl since the school year started. They really liked her, thought she was great, and felt they were moving towards a relationship. But then they found out she's dating someone who looks like them. The author got hurt and stopped talking to her, then reached out again. They also mention that the boyfriend doesn't like them, but they don't care because they value their friendship. Another friend called the author creepy and threatened to tell the girl unless they stop.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether pursuing a girlfriend of someone else is wrong. Generally, relationships are exclusive, so if the girl is in a committed relationship, the author's actions could be seen as inappropriate. Even if there was some mutual affection, once it's known that she's dating someone else, continuing to pursue her might be considered unethical or disrespectful to the boyfriend.\n\nThe author says they \"love our relationship and the time we spend together,\" implying they keep hanging out despite knowing she's taken. That's problematic because it can be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship. Also, confessing feelings to a friend and not to the girl herself might not be the right approach. The friend's reaction (calling them creepy) suggests that others see this as wrong.\n\nEven if the author felt there was mutual attraction, once the boyfriend is involved, pursuing the girl could be seen as the wrong thing to do. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
