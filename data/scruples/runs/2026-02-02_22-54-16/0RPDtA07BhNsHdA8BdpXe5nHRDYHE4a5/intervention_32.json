She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The writer started hanging out with her, thought they were developing feelings, but then found out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He's hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. The guy's friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the writer is in the wrong. The girl is in a relationship, so pursuing someone who's already in a relationship is generally considered unethical. Even if they were close friends before, the writer's actions after finding out she's dating someone else might be problematic. He continued to pursue her, which could be seen as interfering with her relationship. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure and doesn't like him adds another layer, but that's not an excuse for the writer's behavior.\n\nThe writer mentions that they had a \"wonderful thing brewing,\" but if she's in a relationship, then pursuing that would be wrong. The line between friendship and pursuing a relationship is crossed here. Also, the writer's friend called him creepy, which is a red flag. Even if the writer thinks there's hope, the girl is not single, so continuing to pursue her is inappropriate. The writer's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the girl's current relationship and her partner. So the answer would likely be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
