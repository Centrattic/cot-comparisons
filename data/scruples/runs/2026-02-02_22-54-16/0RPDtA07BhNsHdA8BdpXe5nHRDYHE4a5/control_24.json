She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has been spending a lot of time with a girl since the school year started. They both enjoyed each other's company, and the author thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then the author finds out the girl is already dating someone who looks similar to him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to resume their friendship. However, his friend called him creepy for continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing someone who's already in a committed relationship. Even if they were close friends and had mutual enjoyment, the fact that she's with someone else complicates things. The author's actions might be seen as inappropriate because he's continuing to pursue her, which could be considered disrespectful to both the girl and her boyfriend. \n\nThe author mentions that he loves their friendship and doesn't want to let it go, but the friend who warned him says he's being creepy. The line between friendship and romantic pursuit can be blurry, especially when one person is in a relationship. If the author is still showing interest or trying to develop a romantic relationship with her, that's likely the issue. Even if the girl isn't reciprocating, his actions could be interfering with her relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the girl's perspective. If she's in a relationship, she might not be interested in pursuing a romantic connection with the author, even if they have a good friendship. The author's pursuit might be making her uncomfortable or complicating her existing relationship. The boyfriend's dislike towards the author could be due to feeling threatened, which is a natural reaction in such situations.\n\nThe author's justification is that he believes there's hope, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Just because he feels a connection doesn't mean it's appropriate to pursue someone who's already in a relationship. The friend's warning about being creepy is a red flag. The author might be ignoring boundaries here, thinking that friendship allows for romantic overtures, but that's not the case when there's a committed partner involved.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: the girl is in a relationship, the author is pursuing her romantically despite this, which is likely inappropriate. The friend's warning highlights that the author's actions are crossing a line. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
