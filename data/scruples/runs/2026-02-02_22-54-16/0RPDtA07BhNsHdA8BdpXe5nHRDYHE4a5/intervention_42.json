She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The key points here are that the girl has a boyfriend, the narrator found out later and was hurt, then tried to reconnect but the boyfriend is uncomfortable. Also, a friend called them creepy.\n\nFirst, the girl's in a relationship, so by definition, any pursuit by someone else is problematic. The narrator thought they were building something, but the girl chose her boyfriend instead. Even if they were close friends, once you know she's with someone else, continuing to pursue her could be seen as crossing a line. The narrator mentions feeling hurt and moving on, but then they reached out again, which might not be respectful of her current relationship. The friend's reaction suggests that the pursuit is making others uncomfortable, which adds to the issue. So, even if the narrator had good intentions, pursuing someone who's already in a relationship is generally considered wrong. The answer is probably A.\n"
