She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The scenario is that the girl and the author were hanging out a lot, and he thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then he found out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now his friend called him creepy and wants him to stop or tell her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing her despite that. Even if the boyfriend looks similar, the fact remains she's already with someone else. The author thought they were moving towards a relationship, but maybe he misread the signals. The key here is whether his actions after knowing she's in a relationship are appropriate.\n\nHe mentioned that after finding out, he stopped talking for a few days, which could be a mature reaction. But then he reached out again, implying he still wants to continue their friendship. However, pursuing a relationship with someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong. The author might be in the wrong if he's actively trying to get the girl to leave her boyfriend. The friend calling him creepy suggests that his actions are being seen as inappropriate or intrusive.\n\nAlso, the girl's boyfriend is uncomfortable with him, which adds to the problem. Even if the author thinks there's hope, continuing to pursue someone who's in a committed relationship can be seen as unethical. The author's justification is that he loves their friendship, but if he's trying to get her to choose him over her current boyfriend, that's crossing a line.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on the fact that he's aware she's dating someone else and still pursuing her. Even if he thinks they were close, once the relationship is known, continuing to pursue is problematic. So the answer is probably A, yes, he is in the wrong.\n"
