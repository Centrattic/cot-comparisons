She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation involves the author and a girl who have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The author felt they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out she's dating someone else who looks similar. The author was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, a friend is threatening to tell the girl about the author's feelings unless he stops.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing someone who's already committed. The author thought there was a mutual connection, but the girl chose someone else. The author's actions after finding out might be questionable. \n\nThe main issue here is whether pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend is wrong. Generally, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is considered ethically wrong because it can be seen as interfering in an existing relationship. The girl's boyfriend might feel threatened or disrespected. Also, the author might be leading the girl on if there's any hint of reciprocation, even if she's not single. \n\nThe author mentioned that after finding out, they stopped talking for a few days but then resumed. The friend called them creepy, which suggests that the pursuit might be making others uncomfortable. The threat from the friend indicates that the author's behavior is crossing boundaries. \n\nEven if the author believes there's a connection, respecting the girl's current relationship status is important. The fact that the boyfriend doesn't like the author adds another layer, as it could create tension and disrespect towards the boyfriend's feelings. \n\nThe author might not realize that continuing to pursue someone who is in a relationship is inappropriate, regardless of their feelings. The key here is about respecting others' relationships and boundaries. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're pursuing someone who isn't available, which can be seen as disrespectful to both the girl and her boyfriend.\n"
