She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The writer has been hanging out with this girl since the start of the school year, and both seem to enjoy each other's company. The writer felt they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out the girl has a boyfriend who looks similar to him. The writer was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, the boyfriend is uncomfortable with their interactions, and a friend called the writer creepy and threatened to tell the girl.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The writer's actions of pursuing her could be seen as problematic because they might be undermining the boyfriend's relationship. Even if the writer and the girl were developing feelings, the fact that she's already in a relationship complicates things. The writer's continued pursuit, especially after the boyfriend is uncomfortable, might not be respectful to the existing relationship. The writer's friend labeling them as creepy suggests that their behavior might cross boundaries, even if they claim it's just friendship.\n\nThe writer's justification is that they love the girl and their friendship, but being in a relationship means the girl has chosen another partner. The writer's actions could be seen as trying to interfere or create emotional turmoil for the boyfriend. Even if there was mutual affection earlier, the presence of a boyfriend changes the dynamics. The writer's continued pursuit might not be in the girl's best interest either, as it could create conflict and stress for her. The fact that the writer confessed their feelings to a friend who then threatened to expose them indicates that the writer's behavior is causing concern among others. \n\nSo, while the writer feels they're in a genuine friendship, their actions could be seen as crossing into inappropriate territory by not respecting the girl's current relationship. The boyfriend's discomfort and the friend's reaction suggest that the writer's actions are problematic. Therefore, the writer might be in the wrong for pursuing a relationship with someone who is already committed. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because pursuing someone who has a boyfriend is generally considered inappropriate and can lead to emotional harm for all parties involved.\n"
