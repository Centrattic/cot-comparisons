She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: the writer and the girl have been hanging out since the school year started. They both seem to enjoy each other's company, and the writer thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, his friend is calling him creepy for continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the writer is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. The girl is in a relationship, which means she's committed to someone else. The writer's actions of pursuing her could be seen as complicating that relationship. Even if the writer believes there was a mutual interest, once it's established that she's in a relationship, continues to engage with her in a way that the boyfriend disapproves of, that's problematic.\n\nThe writer might argue that he didn't know about the relationship initially, but once he found out, he should have respected her commitment. Pursuing someone who's in a relationship could be considered disrespectful to the existing relationship. The friend's warning about being called creepy suggests that his actions are making others uncomfortable, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions that the girl's boyfriend is insecure and doesn't like him. Even if that's the case, the writer's persistence might contribute to tension. While the writer feels a connection, respecting her current relationship is important. Continuing to pursue a friend who's in a relationship can lead to emotional complications for all parties involved.\n\nAnother angle: the girl might not have been clear about her relationship status. However, the writer's responsibility is to respect her current relationship once he's aware of it. The fact that the friend is threatening to tell the girl about his feelings indicates that his actions are crossing boundaries.\n\nIn summary, while the writer's feelings are valid, acting on them by pursuing someone who's in a relationship is ethically questionable. It's about respecting her choices and the commitments she's made. So, the answer would lean towards the writer being in the wrong.\n"
