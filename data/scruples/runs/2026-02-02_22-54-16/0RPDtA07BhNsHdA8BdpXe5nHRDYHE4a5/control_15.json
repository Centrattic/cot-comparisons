She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who's been spending time with a girl who has a boyfriend. He thought they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out she's already dating someone who looks like him. He got hurt, stopped talking to her, then reached out again. His friend called him creepy for continuing to pursue her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider key factors here. The girl already has a boyfriend, which is a major point. The author knew about the boyfriend after some time, yet continued to pursue her. Even though he felt there was unspoken potential, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it's not ethical. The boyfriend's disapproval adds another layer, but the main issue is the author's actions towards the girl.\n\nHe mentions that they were hanging out a lot before he knew about the boyfriend. However, once he found out she's dating someone else, he should have respected her current relationship. The fact that he thought there was \"hope\" might not matter because she's already committed. Continuing to pursue her after that could be seen as interfering in an existing relationship, which is typically viewed as wrong.\n\nAlso, his friend's reaction is a sign that his behavior is crossing a line. Even if he feels there was mutual feelings before, the girl's relationship status changes things. The author's actions, like continuing to hang out and expressing his feelings, might be making the situation uncomfortable for the girl and her boyfriend. \n\nSo, the main question is whether pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is wrong. In most ethical standards, yes, because it's not respecting her current committed relationship. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" doesn't justify his actions. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
