She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The author feels they were moving towards a relationship, and the girl has shown positive attention. Then, the author finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar. The author is hurt, stops talking to her, then tries to resume the friendship. However, the boyfriend doesn't like the author. The author's friend labels them as creepy and threatens to tell the girl if they don't stop. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, key points here: the girl is in a relationship, the author was pursuing her, the author was aware of the boyfriend, but continued to interact with her. The author confesses their feelings to a friend, which leads to the friend threatening to expose them.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong. Even if the girl was flirting or showing interest, if she's in a committed relationship, the author's actions could be seen as inappropriate. The author might not have known about the boyfriend initially, but once they found out, continuing the pursuit is problematic. The fact that the boyfriend looks similar might add some confusion, but that's not an excuse. The author should respect the girl's relationship status, regardless of their feelings. The author's behavior of continuing to reach out and not heeding the friend's warning could be seen as crossing a line. The friend calling them creepy suggests that the behavior is unwelcome. So, even if the author believes there's hope, pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is generally wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
