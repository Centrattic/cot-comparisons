She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend, despite some signs that their relationship was moving towards a romantic connection.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: They've been hanging out a lot since the start of the school year. The girl is described as fun, beautiful, and modest. The author feels they were developing feelings and thought they were moving towards a relationship. The girl texts him to hang out, and he's happy. Then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He's hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again and continues the friendship. The boyfriend seems to dislike him, and a friend calls the author creepy and threatens to tell the girl.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. Even if they were spending time together a lot and the author thought there was potential, the fact remains she's with someone else. The author's actions could be seen as pursuing someone who is not available. Even if the girl didn't reciprocate romantic feelings explicitly (she might have thought they were just friends), the author's belief that there's \"hope\" might not consider her current relationship status. \n\nThe friend calling him creepy and threatening to tell the girl suggests that the author's behavior might be overstepping boundaries. Continuing to pursue a friend who is in a relationship, especially after being told by a mutual friend to stop, could be seen as persistent and potentially disrespectful towards both the girl and her boyfriend. The author might not realize that the girl's actions (like texting to hang out) don't necessarily indicate romantic intent, especially if she's already in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author continued to pursue the relationship despite the boyfriend's dislike might be seen as disregarding the boyfriend's boundaries. The author's justification is that he loves the friendship and the time they spend together, but if the girl is in a committed relationship, maintaining that friendship while the author has romantic feelings could be problematic. The girl might not reciprocate those feelings, leading to potential hurt if the situation is exposed. \n\nIn terms of social norms, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally frowned upon, regardless of mutual friendship or perceived signs of interest. The author's interpretation of the girl's behavior as leading towards a relationship might be a misreading of her intentions, especially since she's already committed. The friend's warning about being creepy and the threat to expose his feelings indicate that his behavior is not socially acceptable in this context. \n\nTherefore, considering the girl's relationship status and the potential disruption to her current partnership, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
