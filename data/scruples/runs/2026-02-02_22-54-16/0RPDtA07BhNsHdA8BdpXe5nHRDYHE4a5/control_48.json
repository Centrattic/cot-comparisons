She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The situation is that the girl has been hanging out with the author a lot since the school year started, leading him to believe they might be moving towards a romantic relationship. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a bit, then tries to reconnect. His friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl if he doesn't stop or confess.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The author's actions involve pursuing her despite her being with someone else. Even if they had a close friendship and she seemed to enjoy his company, she's not single. The problem is that the author might be misinterpreting her friendship as romantic interest. The fact that she's with someone else means that continuing to chase her could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of how genuine his feelings are.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's been hanging out with her a lot, and after finding out she's in a relationship, he's upset and then tries to reconnect. His friend's reaction suggests that his actions might not be respectful of her current relationship. The line between friendship and romantic pursuit can be blurry, but since she's in a committed relationship, his pursuit could be crossing that line.\n\nEven if the author believes there's hope, the ethical consideration here is that he should respect her relationship. Pursuing someone who's already in a relationship can be seen as interfering, especially if it's clear they're not looking for something else. The author's actions, regardless of his feelings, might be causing discomfort to both the girl and her boyfriend. The friend's warning adds another layer, indicating that others see his behavior as problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is in a relationship, which isn't respectful of her commitment. Even if the girl is friendly and they shared time together, that doesn't mean she's open to a romantic relationship. The answer should be A.\n"
