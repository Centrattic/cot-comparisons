She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is saying that they've been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. They really like her and thought there was a mutual connection. But then they found out she's dating someone else who looks a lot like them. The author was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days but then went back to being friends. Now, the author is continuing to pursue her even though she's in a relationship. A friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl if they don't stop. The question is, is the author the asshole here?\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author thought there was a budding relationship with a girl, but she's actually in a relationship with someone else. The author is continuing to pursue her despite that. The boyfriend is apparently uncomfortable with the author. The author's friend says they're being creepy.\n\nSo, the main issue here is that the girl is already in a committed relationship, and the author is trying to pursue her. That seems like a problem because pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong. It could be seen as disrespectful towards the other person's relationship and could cause emotional harm.\n\nThe author mentions that they thought there was a connection and that the girl was showing interest. However, the girl's actions (dating someone else) might mean that she isn't actually interested in a relationship with the author. The author's assumption that there was mutual interest might be incorrect, which could lead to them misinterpreting friendly interactions as romantic.\n\nAnother point is the author's continued pursuit after finding out the girl is in a relationship. Even if they thought there was a connection, once they know she's with someone else, it's not appropriate to keep trying. The boyfriend's discomfort is a red flag, but the author ignores it, which could be seen as insensitive or even manipulative.\n\nThe friend's warning adds another layer. The author is being told that their behavior is inappropriate and could lead to the girl finding out. The author's response is to keep pursuing her, which might be considered persistent despite others' concerns. That persistence could be interpreted as not respecting boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a situation where they have feelings for someone who is in a relationship. Their actions of pursuing her could be seen as interfering with her committed relationship. Even if there was a mutual friendship, continuing to express romantic interest and pursue her while she's with someone else is generally considered wrong. It's possible the author misread the girl's signals, but once they knew about the relationship, they should have stopped. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the girl's relationship and for continuing to pursue her despite the boyfriend's disapproval and their friend's warning.\n"
