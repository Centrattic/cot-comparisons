She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post, which is pretty common online where people seek opinions on their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and a girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. He's developed feelings for her, and she seems to reciprocate in some ways\u2014texting him, asking to hang out, telling him she enjoys spending time with him. But then he finds out she's in a relationship with someone who looks similar to him. He's hurt and stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again. They continue their friendship, but her boyfriend is apparently uncomfortable. The author's friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl if he doesn't stop or come clean. Now he's questioning if he's the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and respect in relationships. The girl has a boyfriend, so pursuing a relationship with her while she's in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong. Even if the author believes there's mutual interest, the fact remains that she's in a relationship. The author's actions might be seen as interfering or leading her on if he knew about the boyfriend. \n\nHe mentions that she's been texting and spending time with him, which could lead to mixed signals. But the core issue is whether he's aware that she's in a relationship. If he pursued her knowing she was seeing someone else, that's definitely problematic. However, if he didn't know initially and only found out later, the situation changes slightly. But even then, continuing the pursuit after discovering she's in a relationship is still inappropriate.\n\nThe author's friend calling him creepy is a red flag. It suggests that his actions are making others uncomfortable and might be perceived as harassment. The boyfriend's insecurity also indicates that the social dynamics are tense. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might stem from the girl's affectionate texts and interactions, but that doesn't negate the fact that she's in another relationship. \n\nIn social norms, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally frowned upon because it can cause harm to all parties involved. Even if the author isn't intentionally trying to sabotage the relationship, his actions could be seen as unethical. The girl might also be at fault for not being clear about her relationship status, but the question is about the author's actions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he is pursuing a relationship with someone who is already committed. However, there's some nuance if he didn't know about the relationship initially, but since he found out and continued, that makes his actions more blameworthy. The friend's warning and the potential impact on the girl's existing relationship support the conclusion that he's in the wrong.\n"
