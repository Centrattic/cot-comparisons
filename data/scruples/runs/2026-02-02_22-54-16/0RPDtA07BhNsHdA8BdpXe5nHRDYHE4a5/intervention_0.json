She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the girl and the author have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. She's described as fun, beautiful, and modest. The author feels they were moving towards a relationship, with mutual compliments. But then he finds out she's dating someone who looks like him. He's hurt, stops talking to her, then tries to reconnect. His friend calls him creepy if he doesn't stop pursuing her. The author is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here: the girl is already in a relationship. The author believes there was a budding connection, but she chose someone else. Now he's trying to maintain a friendship while possibly pursuing her. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, pursuing someone who's in a committed relationship is generally frowned upon. Even if the author thinks the relationship isn't serious or that the girl isn't happy, it's still not his place to intervene. The girl has made her choice, and the author's actions could be seen as disrespecting her current relationship. Also, the friend's warning about being creepy suggests that his persistence might be making the girl uncomfortable, even if she hasn't said so herself.\n\nBut the author argues that their friendship is important to him, and he's trying to maintain it despite the boyfriend's disapproval. However, the act of \"pursuing\" implies more than just friendship\u2014it suggests trying to develop a romantic relationship. That could be problematic because it might interfere with her existing relationship. The author's feelings are valid, but acting on them when she's already committed could be seen as wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not realize that his actions are crossing a boundary. Even if the girl hasn't explicitly rejected him, the fact that she's in a relationship means that the author should respect that. The friend's reaction (\"creepy\") is a red flag that the author's behavior is inappropriate. So, despite the author's good intentions, his actions are likely in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who is not available, which can harm the existing relationship and potentially hurt all parties involved.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's pursuing a girl who is in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate regardless of his feelings.\n"
