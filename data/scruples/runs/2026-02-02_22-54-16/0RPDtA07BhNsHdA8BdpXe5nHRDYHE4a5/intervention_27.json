She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person has been spending a lot of time with a girl who has a boyfriend. They both seem to enjoy each other's company and the author thought there might be a romantic connection developing. But then they found out the girl is already in a relationship with someone who looks similar. The author felt hurt, took a break, then tried to reconnect, but the friend called them creepy for pursuing someone in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether it's appropriate to pursue someone who is already in a committed relationship. The author mentions that the girl is dating someone else, so even if their interactions are friendly, the fact that the author is interested in a romantic relationship while the girl is with someone else is problematic. The key point is that the girl has a boyfriend, so any romantic pursuit by the author is interfering with her existing relationship. \n\nEven though the author claims they love their friendship and the time together, the line between friendship and romantic pursuit is blurry here. The author's feelings might be genuine, but pursuing a relationship with someone who is already committed is generally considered wrong because it can cause emotional harm to all parties involved. The boyfriend's disapproval is another sign that this situation is uncomfortable and inappropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the friend's reaction that the author is being creepy is a red flag. It suggests that the author's actions might be seen as inappropriate or intrusive, even if they're not intentionally doing anything malicious. The fact that the author is still trying to maintain a close relationship despite the girlfriend's existing commitment could be interpreted as persistent attention that isn't welcomed, especially in the context of a boyfriend.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are understandable and they might not have intended to cross any lines, the act of pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong. The right thing would be to respect the girl's relationship and step back to avoid causing further emotional complications. Therefore, I think the answer is A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
