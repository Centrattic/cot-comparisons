She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is a bit complicated. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and this girl have been hanging out a lot since school started. They both seem to enjoy each other's company. She's described as fun, beautiful, etc., and the author feels they were moving towards a relationship. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He's hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again. The guy's friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop. The question is if the author is the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl is already in a relationship. The author thought there was a mutual connection leading to a relationship, but she's already dating someone else. The author continues to pursue her after finding out, even though the boyfriend is present and maybe uncomfortable. The friend calls him creepy, which suggests that his actions might be overstepping.\n\nIn most ethical and social standards, pursuing someone who is in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong. Even if both people feel there's a connection, the girl is already with someone else. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to her current partner. Also, if the girl isn't making it clear that she wants to end her current relationship before moving on, the author might be complicating things. The fact that the friend called him creepy indicates that his behavior is being perceived as inappropriate or harassing.\n\nEven if the author believes there was a brewing relationship, once it's clear that she's in a relationship, continuing to pursue her would be problematic. The author's statement about loving their friendship and not wanting to stop suggests he might not be respecting her relationship status. The boyfriend's discomfort is a sign that the situation is causing issues for others involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship, which is generally considered unethical and could be harmful to all parties involved. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
