She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author has been hanging out with this girl since the school year started. They describe her as fun, beautiful, and modest, and they really feel a connection. The girl has been texting him to hang out and even says he's great and loves spending time with him. The author thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then he finds out she's dating someone who looks just like him in their dorm. He's hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again because he values their friendship. However, a friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl if he doesn't stop pursuing her. The author is wondering if he's the asshole here, and the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social norms around pursuing someone who is already in a relationship. Generally, it's considered wrong to pursue someone who is committed to another person because it can disrupt their relationship and is disrespectful to the partner. Even if the girl seems interested, the fact that she's in a relationship means that pursuing her could be seen as unfaithful or manipulative.\n\nThe author mentions that the girl is in a relationship with someone who looks similar to him. This might explain why she chose the other guy, but that doesn't justify the author continuing to pursue her. The key point here is that the girl is already in a committed relationship. Even if the relationship isn't ideal or if the partner is insecure, that's not the author's concern. The author's actions could be making the situation uncomfortable for the boyfriend and complicating the girl's relationship.\n\nThe author says that after finding out, he took a break, then reached out again because he loves their friendship. However, continuing to hang out and express feelings for someone who's in a relationship can be seen as inappropriate. The friend's reaction that he's creepy suggests that his behavior is crossing boundaries. The author might not realize that even if the girl is open to the relationship, pursuing her while she's with someone else is considered wrong in most social contexts.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The girl hasn't explicitly said she wants to end her current relationship or is interested in the author. Her texts and compliments might be signs of friendship or appreciation for spending time together, but not necessarily romantic interest. The author might be misinterpreting these signals, leading him to believe there's a mutual romantic connection that doesn't exist beyond friendship.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions could be causing emotional harm. The boyfriend's insecurity is a result of the author's pursuit, which is his problem to deal with, but the author isn't helping by continuing to interact with the girl. The friend's warning is a red flag that the author's actions are not accepted by others around him.\n\nIn most ethical frameworks, respecting people's relationships and boundaries is crucial. Even if the author believes there's hope, pursuing someone in a relationship without considering the consequences is generally frowned upon. The author's belief that he's not in the wrong might stem from his feelings and the girl's positive responses, but those positive interactions don't override the fact that she's already committed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is in a relationship, which is socially and ethically problematic regardless of his intentions or the girl's mixed signals.\n"
