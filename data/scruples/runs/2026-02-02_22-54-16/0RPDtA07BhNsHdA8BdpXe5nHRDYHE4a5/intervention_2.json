She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author started hanging out with the girl early in the school year. They both seemed to enjoy each other's company, with mutual positive feelings. The author thought they were moving towards a relationship but later found out the girl was dating someone else who looks like him. The author was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. They continue to hang out, but the boyfriend is uncomfortable. Another friend called the author creepy and threatened to reveal their feelings if they didn't stop.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the author pursued her after knowing this, and continued interacting despite the boyfriend's discomfort. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can undermine the committed relationship. Even if the author believed there was mutual interest, the girl is with someone else. Continuing to pursue after being made aware of the boyfriend's existence could be seen as crossing a line. The author's actions might lead to emotional harm for the girl and her boyfriend. The friend's comment about being creepy and the threat to expose the feelings suggests others see the behavior as inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the author claims they still want to maintain the friendship, which is a positive intent. But the issue is the continued pursuit despite the existing relationship. The line between friendship and pursuit can be blurry, but if the author is showing romantic interest and the other person is in a relationship, that complicates things. The author's continued interaction might be seen as leading the girl on or causing discomfort to her partner.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is likely in the wrong because they are pursuing someone who is not available, potentially harming an existing relationship. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
