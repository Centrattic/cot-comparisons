She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The writer mentions they've been hanging out a lot, and there were signs of mutual interest, but the girl is dating someone else. The writer even acknowledges that the boyfriend looks similar, which adds to the confusion. \n\nThe writer says he stopped talking to her for a few days after finding out but then decided to continue their friendship. However, the boyfriend is uncomfortable with the writer's presence. The writer's friend even called him creepy and threatened to expose his feelings. \n\nNow, the key points here: pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can disrupt the existing relationship and is disrespectful to the partner. The writer's actions, like reaching out despite the boyfriend's disapproval and continuing to pursue the girl, show that he's not respecting her current relationship. Even if there were mutual feelings, the girl chose to be with her boyfriend, so the writer's persistence might be seen as crossing boundaries. \n\nThe friend's reaction also indicates that the writer's behavior is perceived as inappropriate. The writer's belief that there's \"hope\" despite the girlfriend's existing relationship is problematic. It's important to respect people's relationship status and not push for something that's not available. \n\nTherefore, the writer is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is already committed to someone else, which is not acceptable regardless of his feelings.\n"
