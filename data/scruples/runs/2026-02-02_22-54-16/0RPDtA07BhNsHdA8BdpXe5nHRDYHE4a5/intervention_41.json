She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot, the author thought there was potential for a relationship, but then found out she has a boyfriend. The author is confused and hurt, and after some back and forth, they're still trying to maintain the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing someone who's not available. Even if they were close friends, it's generally considered wrong to pursue someone who is already with someone else. The author mentions that they stopped talking for a few days after finding out but then tried to reconnect. They also mention that the boyfriend doesn't like them, which might indicate some jealousy or tension.\n\nThe author's friend called them creepy and warned to stop or confess. This suggests that others see the behavior as inappropriate. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might stem from the time they spent together, but the girl is already committed to someone else. So, pursuing a relationship with someone who is in a relationship is generally frowned upon because it can lead to emotional harm and breaches of trust.\n\nEven if the author isn't intentionally trying to sabotage the relationship, their actions could be seen as leading the other person on or creating complications. The fact that the girl is with someone else is a clear boundary that the author is crossing. So, from a social standpoint, the author is likely in the wrong because they're continuing to pursue someone who is not available.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
