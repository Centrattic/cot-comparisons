She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot, both seemed to have mutual feelings, but then the girl is revealed to be dating someone else. The author is hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect, and now a friend is calling them creepy.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the girl is in a relationship. If the author knew she was dating someone else, then pursuing her would be wrong. But the author didn't know initially. However, the key point is that once they found out she was in a relationship, they should have stopped. The author did stop for a few days but then resumed hanging out. That's problematic because continuing to pursue someone who's in a relationship is generally considered unethical. The author is also ignoring the boyfriend's discomfort, which shows a lack of respect for his feelings. The friend's warning adds another layer\u2014being called creepy implies that the persistence is unwelcome and possibly harassment. The author's belief that there's still hope might not align with the girl's actual situation, especially since she's already in a committed relationship. So, the author is in the wrong because they're pursuing a relationship with someone who's not available, despite knowing the boyfriend exists. The answer should be A.\n"
