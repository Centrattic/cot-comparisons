She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation starts with the author hanging out with the girl since the school year began. They describe her as fun, beautiful, etc., and mention that they felt a relationship was forming. However, the girl is actually dating someone else who looks similar. The author got hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, the author is continuing to hang out despite the boyfriend's disapproval, and a friend called them creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue here is that the girl is in a committed relationship. The author is continuing to pursue her, which could be seen as interfering with her existing relationship. Even if the author believes there's potential, the girl is already with someone else. The author's actions after finding out about the boyfriend are questionable. \n\nThe author mentions that the girl told them great things and they felt a connection, but the girl was already in a relationship. That suggests the girl might have been leading the author on, but the author still chose to continue pursuing her. The author's friend's reaction is also a red flag; being called creepy and threatening to expose the feelings implies that the behavior is indeed inappropriate.\n\nEven if the author didn't know about the boyfriend initially, once they found out, continuing to pursue her despite the boyfriend's presence and the friend's warnings crosses ethical boundaries. The author's belief in \"hope\" doesn't absolve them of responsibility. Relationships require mutual consent, and the girl is already in a relationship. Continuing to pursue someone who is in a relationship can be seen as wrong, regardless of personal feelings.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because pursuing someone who is in a committed relationship is generally considered inappropriate and unethical. The author's actions, despite their emotions, interfere with another person's relationship and can be seen as disrespectful to both the girl and her partner.\n"
