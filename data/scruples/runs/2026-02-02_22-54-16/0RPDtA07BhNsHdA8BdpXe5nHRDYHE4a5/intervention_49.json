She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot, and the author felt they were getting close, maybe even developing feelings. Then he found out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He got hurt, stopped talking to her, then reached out again. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what's considered ethical or right in such situations. The main point is that she's in a relationship. If the author knew she was dating someone else, then pursuing her would be wrong. But the key detail here is when he found out. He says he found out she was dating a guy in their dorm. Wait, when did he find out? The timeline is a bit unclear. Did he know from the start that she was dating someone else, or did he find out after they had been hanging out a lot?\n\nLooking at the original message: \"This girl and I have been hanging out since the beginning of the school year.\" Then he mentions he found out she was dating a guy in their dorm. So, did he not know she was dating someone when he started hanging out with her? If he didn't know, then maybe he wasn't in the wrong initially. But once he found out, he should have respected her relationship. However, he says he stopped talking to her for a few days but then reached out again. So he continued to pursue her after knowing she's in a relationship. That part would be wrong because he's trying to form a relationship with someone who's already committed.\n\nAlso, the fact that her boyfriend is similar in appearance might make the situation more complicated, but it doesn't excuse the behavior of pursuing an already taken person. The author's actions after knowing she's in a relationship could be seen as unethical because he's not respecting her current commitment. The friend calling him creepy is because he's showing interest in someone who's in a relationship, which is generally frowned upon. \n\nAnother angle: even if they weren't in a relationship, if there was mutual romantic interest and then she chose someone else, moving on is expected. But the author is trying to maintain contact and continue their friendship while having feelings, which might not be appropriate if he's still in love with her. However, if he's just friends and respects her relationship, that's okay. But if he's making moves or trying to get her to choose him over her current boyfriend, that's where the problem lies.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author started hanging out with her without knowing she had a boyfriend, which might not be his fault. But once he found out, continuing to pursue her and express his feelings to others (like the friend) and trying to maintain contact despite the boyfriend's disapproval would make him complicit in a situation where he's not respecting her relationship. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
