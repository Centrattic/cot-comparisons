She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. He really likes her and thinks she's perfect for him. They've been spending a lot of time together, and he thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then he finds out she's already dating someone who looks just like him. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then tries to reconcile and continue their friendship. However, his friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he doesn't stop or come clean.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship, and the author is pursuing her despite that. The author feels like the boyfriend is similar to him and that the girl wasted a good connection with him. He's trying to maintain a friendship with her even though she's with someone else. But the problem is that pursuing someone who's already in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can undermine the existing relationship and create jealousy or conflict.\n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend is insecure and doesn't like him, which he doesn't care about. But by continuing to pursue a friendship with the girl while she's in a relationship, he's ignoring the boyfriend's feelings and potentially making things uncomfortable for the girl. The fact that he confessed his feelings to a friend, who then called him creepy, suggests that his actions might be crossing boundaries. The friend's threat to expose his feelings if he doesn't stop indicates that others see his behavior as inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that he loves their friendship and wants to continue it, but he's also clearly still interested in her romantically. Even if he's trying to maintain a friendship, his actions might be interpreted as trying to create a romantic connection while she's with someone else. This is where the moral dilemma lies. In most social contexts, pursuing a relationship with someone who's already in a relationship is considered wrong because it's not respecting the existing commitment and can lead to emotional harm for all parties involved.\n\nThe author's belief that there's hope might be misplaced. The girl has chosen to be with someone else, and the author's continued pursuit could be seen as not respecting her choice. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure is a result of the author's actions, not the other way around. The author needs to step back and respect the girl's current relationship instead of trying to push for something that's not there. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing a relationship with someone who is already in a committed relationship, which is generally considered unethical and can cause harm.\n"
