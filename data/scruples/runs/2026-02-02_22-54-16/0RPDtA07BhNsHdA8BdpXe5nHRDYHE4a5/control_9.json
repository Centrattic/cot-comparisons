She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's been hanging out with a girl since the start of the school year, and he feels like they were moving towards a relationship. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks a lot like him. He's hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then tries to reconnect. Now, his friend is calling him creepy because he's still pursuing the girl who's in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The girl already has a boyfriend, so the author is pursuing her despite that. The fact that she's in a relationship is important because it means the author is trying to get involved with someone who's not available. Even if he thought there was a mutual attraction, once he knows she's dating someone else, continuing to pursue her might be considered inappropriate.\n\nHe mentions that she's been texting him and asking to hang out. But if she's in a relationship, maybe she's just maintaining a friendship. The author might be misinterpreting her actions as romantic interest when she's actually just being friendly. Also, the fact that her boyfriend looks like him might mean she's drawn to that type, but that doesn't justify the author's actions. He needs to respect her current relationship.\n\nThe friend calls him creepy, which is a strong term. If the author continues to reach out and try to build a relationship with someone who's taken, that could be seen as obsessive or not respecting boundaries. Even if he says he loves their friendship, if she's in a relationship, he should probably step back and not pursue anything romantic, because that's not fair to her or her boyfriend.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is in a relationship. Even though he might have had feelings, once he knew her status, he should have stopped the pursuit. Continuing to do so is inappropriate and could be hurtful.\n"
