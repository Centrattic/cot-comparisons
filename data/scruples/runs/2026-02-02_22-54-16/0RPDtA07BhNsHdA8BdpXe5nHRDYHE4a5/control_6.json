She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The situation is that the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and the author thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then the author found out the girl has a boyfriend who looks similar to him. The author was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then reconciled and continued the friendship. However, a friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are wrong. The key points here are that the girl is in a relationship, which the author was aware of after finding out. The author continued to pursue her despite her being in a relationship. Even though the author might have thought there was a chance they could be together, once he knew she had a boyfriend, continuing to pursue her would be inappropriate. The author's justification is that he loves their friendship and the time they spend together, but the boyfriend is clearly uncomfortable with the author. \n\nThe friend's reaction indicates that the author's behavior is seen as inappropriate, even creepy. In most ethical and social standards, pursuing someone who is in a committed relationship is considered wrong because it can cause emotional harm to all parties involved. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" despite the existing relationship suggests a lack of respect for the girl's current commitment. \n\nThe author might argue that the girl's friend's reaction is overblown, but the fact that the girl's boyfriend is insecure and the friend is threatening to expose his feelings implies that the situation is not healthy. The author's actions could be seen as manipulative or ignoring clear boundaries once the relationship was known. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for continuing to pursue a relationship with a girl who is already in a committed relationship, even if the initial interactions seemed promising. The correct answer is A.\n"
