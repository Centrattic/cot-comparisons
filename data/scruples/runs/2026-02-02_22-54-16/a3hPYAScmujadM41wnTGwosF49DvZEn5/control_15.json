It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything.

I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for vetoing their husband's choice of the name Aryann for their daughter. The husband picked Aryann, pronounced Ah-ree-ann, but the author is Jewish and finds the name too close to \"Aryan,\" which has negative historical connotations related to Nazism. She tried to change the spelling, but he won't budge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had an agreement to each pick a name and then decide on the arrangement. The author didn't think she'd hate his choice. Now, she's opposing it because of the \"Aryan\" similarity. The husband thinks she's overreacting and that no one would think it's related. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author has a valid concern. The name Aryann, even if pronounced differently, might still evoke associations with Aryan, especially given its historical context. For a Jewish person, this could be particularly sensitive due to the Holocaust and Nazi use of the term. The husband's insistence on keeping the name despite her objection could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and historical awareness.\n\nThe agreement they had wasn't about naming conventions, though. They didn't discuss vetoes. So, if they agreed to each choose one and decide who's first/middle, maybe the husband's choice is within the agreed process. However, the author is now vetoing it because of a valid concern. The question is whether her objection is reasonable.\n\nIn such cases, respecting each other's values is important. The husband's stance that it's just a name and people won't think of Aryan might overlook the author's legitimate emotional response. The key here is whether the author is justified in her objection. Since the name is causing her significant distress due to its association, and she's trying to find a compromise (changing the spelling), but he refuses, her standing up for her beliefs makes sense. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's standing by her values, and the husband isn't considering her perspective adequately.\n"
