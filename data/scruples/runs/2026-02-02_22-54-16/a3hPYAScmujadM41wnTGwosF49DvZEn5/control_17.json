It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetoing their husband's chosen name for their child. The husband picked \"Aryann,\" which the author finds problematic because it's close to \"Aryan,\" and being Jewish, she's uncomfortable with that association. The husband isn't willing to budge, thinking it's just a pretty name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and historical context. The term \"Aryan\" has a very specific and negative connotation, especially in Jewish history due to its association with Nazi ideology. Even if the husband intended it as a neutral or pretty name, the author's objection is valid given the potential for misunderstanding or offense. The author's perspective is rooted in her cultural and religious background, which is a significant factor here.\n\nNext, the situation arises from a mutual agreement to pick names and decide the arrangement. The author didn't think there would be something she'd hate, but this case is a clear example where her values are at stake. The husband, while not malicious, might not be aware of the depth of the issue. However, the fact that the author is pointing out the historical context and the husband dismisses it by saying people won't think twice could be problematic. It's about respect for each other's values and sensitivities.\n\nAlso, in parenting decisions like naming a child, both parents should consider each other's concerns. The husband's refusal to change the spelling despite the author's valid concern could show a lack of compromise. The author's stance is about protecting her cultural identity and avoiding a name that could be seen as insensitive, which is a strong argument.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her objection is based on legitimate cultural and historical reasons, and the husband isn't respecting her perspective by not considering the implications. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
