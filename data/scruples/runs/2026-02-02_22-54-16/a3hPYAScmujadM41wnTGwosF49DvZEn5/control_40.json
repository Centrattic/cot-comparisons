It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child. The name in question is Aryann, which she finds problematic because it's close to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations, especially in a Jewish context. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple agreed each would pick a name and then decide on the arrangement. The husband chose Aryann, and the wife objects due to the association with Aryan, which is a term linked to Nazi ideology. She's Jewish, so that connection is particularly sensitive. The husband thinks she's overreacting and that the name is just a pretty spelling.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the wife is justified in her veto. The husband's choice has a problematic historical and cultural context that the wife is rightfully concerned about. Even if the husband doesn't see the issue, the wife's perspective is valid because the name's similarity to a term with such a dark history could cause issues. The husband is unwilling to budge, which complicates things. \n\nShared decision-making in naming a child is important, and if one person has a strong objection with a valid reason, it's reasonable to reconsider. The wife's objection is based on cultural and historical sensitivity, which is a legitimate concern. The husband's dismissal of her feelings by saying she's reading too deep into it might indicate a lack of understanding of the issue's seriousness. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her veto is justified given the potential negative associations of the name. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
