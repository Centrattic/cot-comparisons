It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child. The name in question is Aryann, which the husband wants to use. The author, who is Jewish, finds the name problematic because it's close to \"Aryan,\" which has strong negative connotations related to racism and the Holocaust. The husband doesn't see the issue and won't change the spelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The author's objection is based on a significant historical and cultural context that causes her distress. Being Jewish, the term \"Aryan\" is deeply associated with Nazi ideology, which targeted Jews during the Holocaust. So her sensitivity to the term is valid and rooted in a painful history.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might not be aware of the full implications, or he might not see the connection. However, in naming a child, it's important to consider the potential for misunderstanding or causing offense, especially when it comes to a name that's commonly used and could be misinterpreted. The husband's insistence on using the name despite the author's concerns could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the historical context.\n\nThe question is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the name's similarity to \"Aryan\" is a real and sensitive issue for someone with her background, her objection is justified. The husband's stance of not changing the name despite her strong feelings could be seen as not respecting her perspective. In a shared decision-making process like choosing a child's name, mutual respect and compromise are essential. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for vetoing the name choice to avoid using a name that has such negative connotations for her. The answer should be B (No).\n"
