It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child. The name in question is Aryann, which is close to \"Aryan,\" a term with strong negative connotations, especially in Jewish context.\n\nFirst, the couple had a process where each picked a name and then decided on the arrangement. The husband's choice of Aryann was unexpected to the author because of its similarity to Aryan. She's Jewish, so the connection is particularly sensitive. He thinks the spelling difference makes it okay, but she's concerned about the connotations.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband might not see the issue, thinking it's just a name. However, the author's objection is based on a significant cultural and historical context. It's important to note that even if the spelling is different, the sound is similar enough that it could be problematic. People might mispronounce it as \"Aryan\" or associate it with the term, leading to unintended offense.\n\nIn terms of the agreement, they didn't discuss vetoes beforehand, but the author is now objecting for a valid reason. The husband's refusal to change the spelling shows he's not considering her concerns. The author is asserting her right to be uncomfortable with a name that has such a charged meaning for her. It's about respect and sensitivity in a partnership.\n\nSo, the author is justified in her stance. The husband isn't considering her valid cultural and personal reasons. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
