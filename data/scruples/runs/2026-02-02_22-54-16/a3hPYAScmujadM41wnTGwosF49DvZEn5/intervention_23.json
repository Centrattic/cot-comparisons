It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully. The author and her husband were trying to pick names for their baby daughter. They each picked a name and then decided which would be first or middle based on how they sounded together. The husband chose Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann), but the author is Jewish and finds the name too close to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations for her. They tried changing the spelling, but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. She's asking if she's the asshole for vetoing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and historical context. The term \"Aryan\" is associated with Nazi ideology and white supremacism. For someone with Jewish heritage, this might trigger strong negative reactions due to the Holocaust and historical persecution. The author is making a veto based on this association, which is a valid personal and cultural response. Even if the pronunciation is different, the written name \"Aryann\" can still bring up those associations, especially in written form where pronunciation might not be as clear. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might not see the issue because he's not considering the historical weight of the term. He might think the pronunciation is different enough, but that doesn't negate the author's feelings. It's possible he's not malicious, just unaware or dismissive of her perspective. \n\nThe question is whether her veto is justified. Since they were supposed to each pick a name and then decide the arrangement, there's no prior agreement on vetoes. However, the author's objection is based on a significant cultural issue. The husband's refusal to change the spelling despite the objection could be seen as not respecting her feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is standing up for her cultural sensitivity, which is important. The husband's insistence might be seen as inconsiderate. But since the situation is about mutual decision-making, maybe there's room for both to compromise. However, given the strong negative connotations, the author's stance isn't unreasonable. So I think the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
