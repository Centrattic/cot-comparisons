It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's choice of the name Aryann for their daughter. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the couple was trying to agree on a name for their daughter. They decided each would pick one name, and then they'd decide on the arrangement. The husband chose Aryann, which the wife found problematic because it sounds too close to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations, especially given her Jewish background. The husband thinks she's overreacting and that the name is just a pretty spelling. The question is whether she's in the wrong for objecting.\n\nLet me consider the key points here. The author is Jewish, and the term \"Aryan\" has historical and cultural significance in that context. Aryans, in the context of the Holocaust, were the master race ideology promoted by the Nazis, which the Jewish community would naturally find offensive. Even if someone else doesn't see the connection, the author's objection is based on her personal and cultural sensitivity. It's important to respect that perspective, especially since the name's pronunciation is similar enough to cause discomfort.\n\nThe husband, on the other hand, might not see the issue. He chose the name for aesthetic reasons, not considering the connotations. However, when the author brings up the potential problem, he dismisses it, thinking others won't notice. This dismissal might be the issue here. In a joint decision like naming a child, both partners' concerns should be taken seriously, even if they differ. The author's objection is valid because it's a matter of cultural sensitivity and personal values.\n\nAlso, the original agreement wasn't about vetoes, but the author is now objecting because of a specific concern. The question is whether her stance is reasonable. Since the name's similarity to a problematic term is real and affects her deeply, her veto isn't just about preference but about a significant ethical or cultural issue. In such cases, it's reasonable for her to insist on a change, even if the husband disagrees. \n\nSo, the husband's refusal to change the spelling despite the author's valid concerns might make him the one at fault. The author is standing up for her values, which is justified. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
