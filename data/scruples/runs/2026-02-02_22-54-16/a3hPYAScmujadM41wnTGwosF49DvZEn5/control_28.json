It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted about vetoing her husband's name choice for their child is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple had a method where each picked a name and arranged them. The husband chose \"Aryann,\" which the wife finds problematic because it's close to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations, especially considering she's Jewish. He doesn't see the issue and won't change the spelling. She's asking if she's wrong for standing her ground.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Cultural sensitivity. The name sounds like \"Aryan,\" which is associated with white supremacy and has a very negative history, especially in the context of the Holocaust. The wife's Jewish background makes this issue more sensitive for her. 2) Respect in decision-making. They had a process, but maybe didn't discuss vetoes. However, if one parent finds the name offensive for a valid reason, shouldn't the other listen? 3) Compromise vs. non-negotiables. The husband is inflexible about the spelling, even when she suggests changing it. But if the issue is about a sensitive term, is that a reasonable place to stand firm?\n\nI think the wife is right to be concerned. \"Aryann\" could be misread as \"Aryan,\" which is offensive. Given her background, her objection is valid. The husband dismissing her concern seems like he isn't respecting her feelings. Even if he thinks others won't notice, the potential for misunderstanding or causing distress is there. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her values. So the answer should be B.\n"
