It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetoing their husband's name choice for their child. The name in question is Aryann. The husband is choosing this name, but the author, who is Jewish, finds it problematic because it's close to \"Aryan,\" which has negative historical connotations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and husband had an agreement where each would pick a name, and they'd decide the arrangement. The author didn't think they'd hate any name he chose, but this one is an issue. The husband won't change the spelling, thinking the author is overreacting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about the name's association with Aryan, which is linked to white supremacy and the Holocaust, especially in the Jewish context. The author's objection is based on valid historical and cultural sensitivity. The husband, on the other hand, seems dismissive, thinking no one will associate it. But that's a naive view; people might make the connection, especially in the Jewish community. \n\nThe author is standing up for their values and the potential pain the name could cause. They're not just being picky; it's a matter of ethics and respect. The husband isn't willing to compromise, which is problematic because he's ignoring the author's valid concerns. In a shared decision-making process, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're protecting their cultural identity and the child's future. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
