It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child. The name in question is Aryann, which the husband wants to use. The author is Jewish and finds the similarity to \"Aryan,\" which has negative historical and racial connotations, especially given the Holocaust and the Jewish experience. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the name. \"Aryan\" is a term with a problematic history, associated with Nazi ideology and white supremacy. Even if the pronunciation is different (Ah-ree-ann vs. Ah-ree-uhn), the spelling is very similar. For someone Jewish, this could be a sensitive issue because of the strong associations.\n\nThe husband, on the other hand, might not see the connection and thinks the name is just pretty. He's unwilling to budge, which shows he might not fully grasp the depth of the issue for the author. The key here is that the author's objection is based on her identity and cultural sensitivity, which are valid reasons.\n\nThe situation started with an agreement to each pick a name and decide the arrangement. They didn't discuss vetoes beforehand, but the author is now exercising her right to object because of the name's problematic connotations. It's about respecting each other's values and boundaries. The husband's insistence might be seen as dismissive of her feelings and cultural background.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is standing up for her values and the potential harm the name could cause. She's not being unreasonable here. The husband's refusal to consider changing the spelling or choosing another name shows a lack of sensitivity to her perspective. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
