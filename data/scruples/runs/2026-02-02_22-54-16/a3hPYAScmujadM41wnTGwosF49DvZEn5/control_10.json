It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child. The husband picked \"Aryann,\" which the author finds problematic because it's similar to \"Aryan,\" a term with negative connotations, especially given her Jewish background. The husband doesn't see the issue and is resistant to changing the spelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had a mutual agreement to each pick a name and decide the arrangement. The author didn't anticipate any names being so offensive to her. The issue here is the name choice conflicting with her values. The husband's stance is that the name is just a name and that others won't think of it as offensive. \n\nNow, considering cultural and historical sensitivities, \"Aryan\" has a very specific and problematic history, especially in relation to Holocaust denial and white supremacy. For someone with a Jewish background, that term would indeed be extremely sensitive. Even if the husband didn't intend any harm, the name's similarity might trigger those associations. \n\nThe author's concern is valid because names can carry cultural weight and personal meaning. The husband's refusal to budge despite her valid reasons might come off as dismissive. The question is whether the author is overstepping by vetoing it. But given the historical context and personal background, her objection is reasonable. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have discussed this sensitivity beforehand. But since they didn't have an in-depth conversation about vetoes, she might not have known to bring it up until the name was presented. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's name choice is problematic because it's too close to a term with such negative implications. The author is standing up for her values and her child's name not being associated with something offensive. So, she's not in the wrong for rejecting it.\n"
