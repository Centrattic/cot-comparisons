It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.\n\nHe picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to \"aryan\" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name \"Aryann.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for vetoing her husband's chosen name for their child. The name in question is Aryann, which the husband pronounces as Ah-ree-ann. The wife is Jewish and finds the name problematic because it's similar to \"Aryan,\" which has negative connotations. The husband doesn't see the issue and won't budge on the spelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had a method to decide names, and they each picked one. The wife didn't think there would be any names she hated, but this one is a dealbreaker for her. The key points here are the emotional and cultural significance of the name. The wife's objection is based on the association with a term that has a racist and oppressive history, especially considering her Jewish background. That's a serious concern because using a name that could be linked to such ideologies might cause distress or be seen as insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband thinks the pronunciation is different enough and that others won't notice. But the problem here isn't just about others' perceptions; it's about the parents' comfort and the child's future. The wife's right to feel uncomfortable with a name that has such a negative association is valid. Even if the husband doesn't see the issue, the wife's perspective is legitimate, especially considering the historical context.\n\nIn terms of the agreement they had, they didn't discuss vetoes, but in cases of strong objections, especially those involving ethical or emotional concerns, it's reasonable for one parent to have a say. The husband being unwilling to compromise might be the issue here. The wife isn't just being petty; she's standing up against something that's deeply offensive to her culture and history. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her objection is based on significant cultural and ethical reasons, and it's reasonable for her to vet the name choice to avoid any association with harmful ideologies.\n"
