I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's brother is the father of a child but won't take a paternity test to avoid child support. The author offers their own DNA to help determine if there's a familial match. The ex-girlfriend declines because the court will handle it. The brother and father are upset, accusing the author of betrayal.\n\nFirst, the author's brother is legally responsible if he is the father. By not taking the test, he's trying to avoid that. The author, thinking they're helping, offers their DNA. But since the author isn't the father, their DNA wouldn't confirm paternity. The ex says the court will compel the test, which is correct because courts can force a paternity test. \n\nThe issue is whether the author overstepped. The brother's refusal is illegal if he is the father. By offering DNA, the author might have thought they were providing alternative evidence, but that's not valid for legal paternity. The brother and father are upset because the author potentially exposed the brother's refusal, which could lead to legal consequences. \n\nLegally, the author isn't at fault. They tried to help, even if their method was flawed. The brother's actions are the problem. The author didn't know the legal process, but their intent was good. The family's reaction is about protecting the brother's interests, but the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer is B.\n"
