I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person's brother had a child with his ex, but the brother refused a paternity test to avoid child support. The writer offered their own DNA to establish a familial link, but the ex didn't need it because the court would handle it. The brother and father are upset, calling it betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the writer did something wrong. The brother's refusal to take the test is likely to avoid legal responsibility. The writer, not knowing legal procedures, offers their DNA to help establish a connection. The ex declines because the court can compel the father to take the test. The family is angry, but is the writer at fault?\n\nLegally, the brother's refusal is problematic. Paternity tests can be enforced by courts, so his refusal might not prevent child support. The writer's action was well-intentioned, trying to help resolve the issue. However, offering their DNA could be seen as overstepping if the family didn't want that approach. But the writer didn't force the test; the ex didn't use it. The family's reaction is about perceived betrayal, but was the writer wrong to act?\n\nEthically, the writer might have thought they were helping, but maybe they shouldn't have involved themselves without the family's consent. However, the brother's actions are self-serving and possibly harmful to the child. The writer's act of offering DNA might be seen as trying to do the right thing, even if it caused family tension. So, is the writer in the wrong? The answer might hinge on whether their action was justified despite family disapproval. Since the brother is the one avoiding responsibility, the writer isn't at fault. Answer B.\n"
