I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who offered their DNA is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother refusing a paternity test, and the author stepping in with their own DNA.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, paternity tests can be mandated by the court if there's a dispute. The brother's refusal might be a problem legally because the court can compel him to take the test. The author's offer to provide their DNA for a familial match isn't directly about proving paternity but could be used to infer a relationship. However, the ex-girlfriend declined, saying the court would handle it. \n\nNext, the family's reaction. The brother and father are upset about \"betraying the family\" and trying to get the brother into trouble. But the author's intention was to help figure out the situation, not to cause harm. The brother's refusal to take the test is his own choice, and the author's action was a misguided attempt to assist. \n\nEthically, the author isn't necessarily at fault. They acted out of concern and didn't have the legal knowledge. However, there's a question of overstepping by offering their DNA without being asked. But since the ex-girlfriend rejected it, the author's action didn't actually affect the legal process. The main issue is the brother's refusal, not the author's offer. \n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to take a test unless compelled by the court. By offering their DNA, the author might have overstepped, but since it wasn't used, there's no real harm. The family's anger is more about the perceived betrayal than any legal wrongdoing. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because their actions were based on a lack of legal knowledge and an attempt to help, even if it wasn't the right approach. The main fault lies with the brother for not cooperating with the court.\n"
