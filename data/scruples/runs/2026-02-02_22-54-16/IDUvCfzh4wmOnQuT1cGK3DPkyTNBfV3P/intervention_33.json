I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is at fault for offering their DNA when their brother refused a paternity test. The brother didn't take the test because he's worried about legal consequences, like being forced to pay child support. The author, not knowing much about the legal stuff, offered their DNA to help determine a familial match. However, the ex didn't need it because the court would handle it, and the brother and their father are upset, calling it a betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the brother is being evasive about a paternity test, maybe he's trying to avoid responsibility. The author's action was to help confirm if he's the father, which could be seen as trying to do the right thing. But the brother might feel like the author is exposing him or interfering in his personal and legal matters. The father is upset too, possibly because he doesn't want to face any potential embarrassment or financial burden if his son is the father.\n\nThe author's intention was good, to help the ex prove paternity through their DNA. But the ex already said the court would handle it, so maybe the author's offer was unnecessary. The question is: is the author wrong for stepping in? Legally, I think the author is not obligated to take the test. The brother and father's anger is more about family dynamics than the author's legal responsibility. The author didn't have to get involved, but their offer was to help. However, they might have overstepped by offering their DNA without understanding the legal process. The ex didn't need it, so the author's action might not have been helpful. But the brother's refusal is problematic, and the author's intent was to assist. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. The answer would be B, No.\n"
