I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who shared their DNA is in the wrong. The situation is that the person's brother refused a paternity test, and the person offered their own DNA to help determine paternity. The ex then said she didn't need it, but the brother and father found out and are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Paternity tests are usually required by the court, and the father can be compelled to take one. If the brother is avoiding the test to dodge child support, maybe the person thought offering their DNA could help prove the relationship. But wait, how would the person's DNA be relevant? Unless the brother and the person are siblings, and the DNA test could show a familial link, maybe the ex is trying to establish a connection. But if the brother is the alleged father, the person's DNA wouldn't prove paternity. So maybe the person misunderstood how DNA testing works here.\n\nThe ex told her she doesn't need it, so the person's action might not have been necessary. The brother and father are upset because the person is trying to help the ex, which they see as betraying the family. So, the question is whether offering DNA was a betrayal or not.\n\nLegally, if the person was trying to help the ex, maybe they overstepped. But if the brother's refusal could harm the child, maybe the person had good intentions. However, the brother's legal rights are important. The person might not have considered that their DNA wouldn't help and that their action could be seen as interfering. So, maybe the person is in the wrong because they acted without understanding the legal process and caused family conflict. But the brother's refusal is also problematic. The person's intentions might be good, but the action could be seen as crossing a line. I think the answer is A, the person is in the wrong, because they offered DNA unnecessarily and caused family issues, even if their intentions were to help.\n"
