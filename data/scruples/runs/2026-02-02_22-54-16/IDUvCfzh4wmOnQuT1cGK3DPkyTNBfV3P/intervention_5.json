I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves offering DNA to help establish paternity because the brother won't take a test. \n\nFirst, the brother's ex wants a paternity test, but he refuses, thinking it protects him from child support. The author offers their own DNA to help, but the ex says the court will handle it. The brothers and father are upset, saying the author betrayed the family.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are intent and legality. The author's intention was likely to help the ex prove paternity, which is a legal matter. However, offering DNA without the brother's consent might be seen as interfering in a legal process. But the ex already said the court would compel the test, implying it's a legal process that doesn't need the author's intervention. \n\nLegally, can someone offer their DNA for a familial match? If the test is to see if the author is a sibling (which would imply the brother is the parent), then maybe it's a way to indirectly prove paternity. But the ex's statement suggests she doesn't need that because the court can force the brother to take the test. \n\nEthically, the author might think they're helping, but the family sees it as betrayal. The brother's refusal is based on a misunderstanding about legal consequences. The author's action, while well-meaning, could be seen as overstepping, but if the ex didn't actually use the DNA, maybe it's not harmful. \n\nHowever, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to resolve a legal issue in a way they thought was helpful. The brother's actions are the root of the problem, and the author's offer might be an innocent attempt to assist. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
