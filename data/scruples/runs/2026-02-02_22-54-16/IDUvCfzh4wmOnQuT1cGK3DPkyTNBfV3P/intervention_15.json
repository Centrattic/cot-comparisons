Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe situation is the brother's ex had a baby, and the brother refused a paternity test because he thinks that if he doesn't take the test, he won't have to pay child support. The author offered their DNA to help, but the ex said the court would handle it. But then the brother and their father found out and are upset, blaming the author. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Legally, in many places, if a man is named on the birth certificate and then refuses a paternity test, the court can indeed compel him. So the brother's belief that avoiding the test prevents child support is a misunderstanding. The author offering their DNA might be an attempt to help establish a familial connection, but the ex didn't need it because the court can force the brother to take the test.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to do the right thing by helping the child and the ex. However, the brother and father see it as a betrayal. The author might have overstepped by offering DNA without considering the family's dynamics. But the brother's refusal to take the test is the root issue here. The author's intent was good, but maybe they should have discussed it with the family first?\n\nHowever, the brother's actions are problematic. He's prioritizing avoiding support over the child's well-being. The author's offer might be seen as trying to help, but the method could be questionable. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the one who refused the test. The brother is the one at fault for not taking responsibility. The author's mistake, if any, is perhaps not understanding family dynamics, but not being in the wrong overall.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The main issue is the brother's actions, not the author offering help, even if it was in a way the family found upsetting.\n"
