I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who refused a paternity test, and the author offered their DNA to help determine if the brother is the father. The ex is going through the court process, and the author's family is upset with them for \"betraying the family.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the court is involved, they can compel someone to take a paternity test, especially if it's necessary for child support. The brother refusing might be causing legal issues because the court can force the test anyway. The author stepping in by offering their DNA might be seen as trying to help the ex prove the brother is the father, which could be beneficial for the child's support. But the family is upset, thinking the author is undermining them.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's intention seems to be helping the ex, which might be seen as the right thing for the child's welfare. But the family values could be different, valuing loyalty over supporting the ex. The author might not have considered the family's perspective, so even if their action was well-intentioned, it could be seen as disloyal.\n\nBut legally, offering DNA isn't a crime. The ex didn't need it because the court can handle it. The author's action might have been unnecessary, but not wrong. The family's anger is more about perceived betrayal than legal wrongdoing. So the author isn't in the wrong legally or morally if their intent was to help the child. The answer is B.\n"
