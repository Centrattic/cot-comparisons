I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about offering their DNA to help determine paternity when their brother refused. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. The brother didn't take a paternity test because he's worried about child support. The author offered their DNA to help, but the ex didn't need it because the court can force the test. However, the author's family is upset because they think the author is betraying them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. Legally, paternity tests can be compelled by the court, so the brother's refusal might not hold up. The author's offer to provide DNA isn't harmful if it's for establishing a familial link, not directly proving paternity. But the brother and father are angry about it.\n\nThe author's intent was to help, but maybe they overstepped by offering without considering the family's dynamics. However, the ex already mentioned the court would handle it. The author's action might not have been necessary, but was it wrong? It's a family conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, unless the author had a duty to keep this secret, offering DNA might not be wrong. The brother's legal issues are his own, but the author's action could be seen as trying to help. However, family dynamics and trust are involved. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to assist, even if the method was flawed or unnecessary. The family's anger is more about betrayal than legal wrongdoing.\n"
