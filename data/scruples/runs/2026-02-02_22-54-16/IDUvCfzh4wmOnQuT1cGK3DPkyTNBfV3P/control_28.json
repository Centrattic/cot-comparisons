I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The scenario is that the author's brother refused a paternity test, so the author offered their own DNA to help. The ex is not interested, but the brother and father found out and are upset, accusing the author of betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Paternity tests are usually required by the court, so the ex might not need the author's DNA since the court can force the brother to take a test. The author's action might be unnecessary, but was it wrong?\n\nEthically, the author is trying to help clarify the situation. The brother's refusal is selfish, possibly to avoid child support. The author's offer could be seen as trying to support the child's legitimate claim, which is a moral stance. However, the family is upset because they feel the author is interfering in family matters.\n\nBut the author didn't know about the legal process. They acted with good intentions, thinking they could help. The ex politely declined, so maybe the author overstepped, but without malicious intent. The key is whether the action was wrong, not the intent. Legally, offering DNA might not be required, but the author's intentions were to help. The family's reaction is about protecting the brother, but the author's actions don't have malicious intent. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B."
