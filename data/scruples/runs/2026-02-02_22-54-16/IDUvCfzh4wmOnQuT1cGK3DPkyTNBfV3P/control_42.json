I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for offering their DNA to the brother's ex when the brother refused the paternity test. The situation involves family dynamics and legal matters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the brother is avoiding the paternity test to dodge responsibility, like child support, then the court can indeed compel him to take the test. The author offered their DNA, which might not be legally valid because they're not the alleged father. Paternity tests need to involve the biological father and child. So the author's DNA wouldn't establish paternity; it might show a familial relationship, but not direct parentage. The ex probably knows this and declined because it's not useful. \n\nNow, the ethical side. The author is trying to help resolve the situation, but their brother and father are upset because they see it as betrayal. The author's intent was to assist the ex, possibly to ensure the child's support, but the family perceives it as siding against their brother. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Legally, offering DNA might not be helpful and the ex declined. The author might not have considered the legal implications of their offer. However, their intention wasn't malicious. The family's reaction is about protecting the brother, but the author's action was well-meaning, even if misguided. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they might have been naive. Answer B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
