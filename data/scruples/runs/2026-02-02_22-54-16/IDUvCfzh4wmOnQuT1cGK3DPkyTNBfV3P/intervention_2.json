I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother refused to take a paternity test because he's worried about child support, and the author offered their own DNA to help. The ex girlfriend declined, but the author's family is upset, calling it betrayal. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's brother is avoiding a legal responsibility by not taking the test. The author tried to help by offering their DNA, thinking maybe it could show a familial link. But the ex didn't need it because the court can compel the test. The family is upset, but does the author have a valid reason?\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the brother is the one who should take the test. The author's action was well-intentioned but might have overstepped. However, the author didn't have malicious intent. They were trying to help the situation, even if they didn't know the legal details. The family's reaction is more about the brother's refusal and the author's involvement, but the author isn't the one refusing the test.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is trying to do the right thing by supporting the child's possible father, even if they made a wrong move. The brother is the one shirking responsibility. The author's action might not be legally necessary, but it's not unethical. The family's anger is misplaced because the real issue is the brother's refusal. \n\nSo, the author's intent was good, even if the action was unnecessary. The answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
