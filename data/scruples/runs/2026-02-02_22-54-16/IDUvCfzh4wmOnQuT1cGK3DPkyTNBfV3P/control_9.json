I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about offering their DNA to help determine paternity when their brother refused. The brother's ex is having a baby, and he's avoiding a paternity test to dodge child support. The author tried to help by offering their DNA, but the ex didn't need it, and now the brother and father are angry, saying it's a betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The brother's refusal to take the test is his own issue. The author, not knowing legal stuff, offered their DNA to help. The ex declined, saying the court would handle it. So the author's intention was to help clarify the situation, maybe to be fair or to prevent the brother from being a deadbeat. But the family is upset because they think the author is trying to harm the brother.\n\nThe main question is whether the author overstepped. The author didn't force the test; they just offered their DNA. The ex didn't use it. The court would have compelled the brother's test anyway. So the author's action didn't actually cause any harm, right? They tried to help, but the ex already had legal avenues. The brother's anger is because the author tried to help, but is that the author's fault?\n\nLegally, if the ex had used the author's DNA, maybe it could have been part of the evidence. But the ex said the court would handle the brother. So maybe the author's action was unnecessary but well-intentioned. The family's reaction is about betrayal, but the author's intentions were to help. The brother's problem is his own actions. So the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to assist. The answer should be B (No).\n"
