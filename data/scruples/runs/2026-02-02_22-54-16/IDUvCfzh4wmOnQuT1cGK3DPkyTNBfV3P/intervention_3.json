I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who offered their DNA is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the brother refuses a paternity test, thinking it avoids child support. The author offers their DNA to help determine a familial connection. The ex declines but the family is upset.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, paternity tests can be court-ordered, so the brother's refusal might not help him. The author offering their DNA\u2014does that interfere with legal processes? Probably not, as the ex didn't take it. The author's intention seems to be to help resolve the issue, even if the brother didn't want to participate.\n\nEthically, the brother's refusal might be selfish, avoiding responsibility. The author's offer could be seen as trying to do the right thing. However, the family's reaction is about betrayal. But is the author at fault for trying to help? Maybe not. They didn't force the ex to take the test; they just offered. The problem arises from family dynamics, not the author's action itself.\n\nAlso, the brother's reasoning is flawed. Courts can compel tests, so his inaction doesn't protect him. The author's offer might be a way to speed up the process. The author didn't act with malice, just a good intention. So, the answer is likely B\u2014author not in the wrong.\n"
