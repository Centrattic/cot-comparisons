I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a brother who refuses a paternity test because he's worried about child support, and the author offers their DNA to help establish a familial match. The ex didn't need it because the court would force the test, but the brother and their father are upset, calling it betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Paternity tests are usually handled through the court, and the father can be compelled to take one. If the brother refuses, the court can force him. So the author's offer might have been unnecessary, but was it wrong? The ex said she didn't need it, but the author still offered. The brother and father are upset because the author is trying to help the ex, which they see as against the family.\n\nThe author's intention was to help clarify the situation, maybe thinking that if their DNA could show a familial match, it would support the brother's paternity. But since the ex didn't need it, maybe the author overstepped. However, the author didn't know the legal process and thought they were helping. The key points here are intent and legal understanding.\n\nThe brother's refusal is a legal issue, and the author, not knowing the legal procedures, tried to assist in a way that might not be necessary. But since the ex didn't use the offer, the author didn't actually interfere. The family's reaction is about perceived betrayal, but the author's action was well-intentioned, albeit misinformed.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author didn't break any laws. The brother's refusal is his own choice, and the author's offer was a good faith attempt to help. Even though it wasn't needed, the intent was not malicious. The family's anger is more about protecting their brother's interests rather than the action itself being wrong. So the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
