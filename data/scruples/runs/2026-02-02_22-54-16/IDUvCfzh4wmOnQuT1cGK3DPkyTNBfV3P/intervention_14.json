I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that their brother refused a paternity test, so the author offered their own DNA for a family match. The ex didn't need it, but the author's brother and father are upset, calling it a betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the court can compel a paternity test, then the brother's refusal might not prevent the court from making him take it. The author's offer to provide their DNA could be seen as helping the ex, but if the court is going to handle it anyway, maybe the author's action wasn't necessary. However, the author didn't know the legal process well, so they might have thought they were helping.\n\nEthically, the brother's refusal is problematic because he's trying to avoid potential child support, which is a legal obligation. The author's intent was likely to help resolve the situation, even if the method was misguided. The father and brother feel betrayed, but is the author responsible for that? If the author didn't mean harm and was trying to assist, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the action might have caused family conflict, which is a consideration.\n\nAlso, the ex didn't need the DNA, so the author's action didn't actually affect the legal outcome. The main issue is the family's reaction. The author's intent was good, but the consequences caused family tension. But does that make them at fault? The brother's refusal was the real problem, and the author's action was a misguided attempt to help. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
