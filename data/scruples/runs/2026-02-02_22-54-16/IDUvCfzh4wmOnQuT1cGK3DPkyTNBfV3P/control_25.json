I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for offering their DNA to their brother's ex to help determine paternity since their brother refused a test. The brother's logic is flawed because not taking the test could still lead to the court compelling him to do it, which is standard procedure. The author's intention was to help clarify the situation, but their family is upset because they feel betrayed.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know the legal process, but they tried to help. The brother's refusal is misguided, so the author's offer might have been a good-faith attempt to resolve things. However, sharing DNA without consent could be an issue. But the ex declined the offer, so maybe the author's action didn't actually cause harm. The family's anger is based on misunderstanding the legal process and taking it as a betrayal. Legally, the court can force the brother to take a test regardless. So the author's action might not have been necessary, but it wasn't malicious. They didn't force the brother to do anything; they just offered help. The key here is intent and whether the author overstepped. Since the ex didn't use the offer and the family is upset, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the family dynamics, but the main issue is the brother's refusal. However, the author's action was well-intentioned but perhaps naive. So the answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
