I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who offered their DNA is at fault. The situation is that their brother refuses a paternity test to avoid potential child support, and the person offered their DNA to help, but the family is upset.\n\nFirst, the brother's refusal is a legal issue. In most places, a court can compel someone to take a paternity test. So the brother's belief that avoiding the test prevents child support is misguided. The person offering their DNA might think they're helping by providing evidence, but the ex has already been told the court will handle it. \n\nThe key points are: the person's intent wasn't to betray but to help, the ex didn't need the DNA, and the family's reaction is based on anger towards the brother's situation. Legally, the person isn't obligated to take a test unless compelled by the court. By offering their DNA, the person might have overstepped, but it was likely a good intention. The brother and father's anger is more about protecting the brother's interests, even if it's misguided. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? They didn't do anything illegal. The problem is the brother's refusal and the family's reaction. The person's action was well-meaning but perhaps unnecessary since the ex didn't need it. However, there's no malicious intent. Therefore, the answer is B, they are not in the wrong."
