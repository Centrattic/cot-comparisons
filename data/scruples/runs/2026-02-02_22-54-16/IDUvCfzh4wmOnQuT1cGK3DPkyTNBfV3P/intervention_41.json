I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about their brother not taking a paternity test, so the author offers their own DNA for a familial match. The ex is handling it, the court will compel the test, but the brother and father are upset, seeing it as betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. If the brother is refusing a paternity test, the court can indeed compel him to take it, right? So the ex probably knows that the court will make him take the test, which is why she declined the author's offer. The author might not realize that their DNA isn't necessary here. But is offering their DNA a problem legally?\n\nThen, the family's reaction. The brother and father are angry, thinking the author is trying to harm the brother. But the author's intention was to help clarify the situation. However, by offering DNA, maybe the author is inadvertently causing more stress or legal issues for the brother, even if it's not directly. Did the author overstep by providing their own DNA without consulting the brother first? The brother might feel that his privacy was invaded or that the author is taking sides without his consent.\n\nBut from another angle, the author is trying to do the right thing by supporting the child's needs, even if the brother is being unreasonable. The father being upset might be because the author didn't follow family dynamics, perhaps. However, the author didn't know about legal stuff, so maybe their good intentions could be considered, but intentions don't always override the impact.\n\nIs there a legal wrong? Probably not, since the DNA wasn't used and the court handles the brother. But ethically, maybe the author should have discussed it with the brother first. But the brother is an adult and made his own choice to refuse the test. The author isn't legally obligated to get his permission before offering to help.\n\nSo the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help, even if they didn't know the legal details. The brother's actions are his own, and the author's offer, though perhaps misguided, was not a legal breach.\n"
