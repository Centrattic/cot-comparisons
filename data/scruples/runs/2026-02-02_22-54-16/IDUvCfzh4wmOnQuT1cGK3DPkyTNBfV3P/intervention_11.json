I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that their brother refused a paternity test, so the author offered their own DNA to help determine if there's a familial match. The ex-girlfriend declined, and then the brother and father got angry at the author for \"betraying the family.\" The user is wondering if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and ethical aspects here. The brother's refusal to take the paternity test is a red flag because, legally, a court can compel him to take one. By not taking it, he's possibly trying to avoid responsibility, which is a problem. The author, not knowing the legal stuff, offered their DNA. But does that cross a line?\n\nLegally, the author isn't the father, so their DNA isn't needed for the paternity test. However, offering it might be seen as trying to help the ex-girlfriend, which the brother and father perceive as betrayal. From a family perspective, maybe they feel the author is siding with the ex against their brother. But the author didn't know the legal stuff and just wanted to help. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the brother's actions are questionable, and the author was trying to help. But maybe the author should have known that their DNA wouldn't be helpful and that it's up to the father to take the test. But the author didn't know that. So maybe not in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the ex turned down the DNA offer, which suggests that the author's action wasn't necessary. The real issue is the brother's refusal. The author's intentions were good, even if they didn't realize the legal implications. The family is upset because they see it as interfering, but the author wasn't the one avoiding responsibility. \n\nSo, answer B: No, the author isn't in the wrong."
