I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is about a brother refusing a paternity test, so the author offered their own DNA to help. The ex-girlfriend declined, and the family is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, a court can compel someone to take a paternity test. The author's brother not taking it might be an issue, but the author stepping in with their DNA\u2014if that's even legally valid? Wait, DNA from a sibling can show a familial relationship but not direct paternity. So maybe the author didn't understand that. The ex didn't need it because the court would handle it. The author's intention was to help, but maybe they didn't realize their DNA wouldn't prove paternity. \n\nThen, the family's reaction. The brother and father are angry about \"betraying.\" The author didn't do anything illegal. The ex didn't use the DNA, so there's no actual harm done. The author's actions were well-meaning, even if misguided. The family's anger seems more about the brother's refusal and the author's role in it. Legally, the author isn't at fault. Ethically, their intention was to help, so they're not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
