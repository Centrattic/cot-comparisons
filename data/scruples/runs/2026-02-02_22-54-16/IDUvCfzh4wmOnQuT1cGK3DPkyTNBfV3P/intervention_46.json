I didn't know anything about legal stuff but I offered her my DNA to test for a familial match. She very nicely told me she doesn't need it and the court will compel the test, but somehow my brother and my father found out and they're really pissed at me for \"betraying the family\" and \"trying to fuck my brother over.\" AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that the brother refused a paternity test, so the author offered their own DNA to help determine if the brother is the father. The ex girlfriend didn't need it, but the family found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, legally, the brother has a right to refuse a paternity test. The author isn't legally obligated to take one, but they offered their DNA to help. Since the ex said the court would handle it, maybe the author's action wasn't necessary. But the intention was to help, right? Maybe the brother and father feel like the author is interfering in their family matter. But is the author actually at fault? They didn't force the test, just offered to help. The ex even declined the offer. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. It's more about family dynamics than legal right. The answer might be B.\n"
