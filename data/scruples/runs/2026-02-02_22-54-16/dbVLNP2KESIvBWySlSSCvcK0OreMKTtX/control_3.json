She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is the asshole for ditching their prom date. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author set up a date with the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend for prom, using a friend named Luke as the other date. The problem arises when the girls at the restaurant are being mean to Luke, especially about his height and the restaurant's food. The author feels bad for Luke and decides to cut the date short by taking the girls to the school and leaving them there. Now, the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author had the right to act that way. The key points are the girls' behavior. They were making fun of Luke, one of them insulted the restaurant, and the author felt it was unacceptable. The author took a stand to protect their friend. That seems like a valid reason to leave. However, ditching someone without warning can be considered rude or inconsiderate.\n\nBut there's context here. The author was involved in setting up the date, knowing the girls' background (the daughter's ex was problematic). The cleaning lady might have known the girls were \"trashy,\" as mentioned. The author's actions could be seen as standing up for Luke, who was being harassed. However, the act of leaving them stranded might have been harsh. Maybe they could have left more politely instead of kicking them out. But the girls were already rude, so the author's response was a form of self-defense and protecting a friend.\n\nAlso, the author didn't get angry or retaliate in a worse manner. They tried to apologize and explain. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating that the author had a legitimate reason. So, while ditching someone isn't ideal, the circumstances justify the action. The author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their friend from bullying. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not the Asshole).\n"
