She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves a setup where the author agreed to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom but ended up taking another friend (Luke) with him. The key events are the girls' behavior at the restaurant, including making fun of Luke's height and calling the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author and Luke then decided to ditch the girls at the school parking lot. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author set up a situation where Luke was put in a bad spot. The girls' behavior was clearly rude and hurtful. Luke was embarrassed and possibly humiliated. The author, feeling responsible, decided to take action to stop the abuse. Was it right to ditch them? On one hand, they had a right to walk away from a hostile environment. On the other, they did so without the girls' consent, which could be seen as a betrayal of the agreement made with the cleaning lady.\n\nLegally, there's not much to consider here. They didn't commit a crime by leaving them. Ethically, it's more complex. The author acted to protect Luke from further harm, which is commendable. However, the method of doing so involved abandoning the girls, which could be seen as irresponsible or inconsiderate. The cleaning lady was apologetic later, which suggests that the author's actions were justified in some way. \n\nBut wait, the author had agreed to take the girls to prom. By ditching them, they broke that agreement. However, the girls' behavior was inexcusable. The author might argue that they had the right to withdraw from an abusive situation. The key question is whether the author had a duty to uphold the date despite the girls' behavior, or if they could reasonably decide to leave to protect their friend.\n\nAnother angle: the author set Luke up with the shorter girl, knowing she was 4'9. Luke was shorter, so maybe the author knew there was a potential for conflict. But it's possible that the author didn't anticipate the girls' behavior. Regardless, when the situation turned, the author took steps to protect Luke, which is a good decision. However, the act of ditching the girls might have been the wrong way to handle it. They could have tried to de-escalate the situation differently, like calling a parent or leaving politely. \n\nThe girls' comments were offensive, especially the racial slur about the restaurant. This shows a lack of respect and maturity. The author might feel justified because the girls were the ones who created the hostile environment. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating she saw the girls' actions as inappropriate. So, the author's decision might be seen as a form of standing up against bullying or poor behavior.\n\nIn summary, while the author broke the initial agreement by ditching the girls, the girls' behavior was inexcusable. The author's actions were to protect Luke and themselves from further harassment. So, it's a judgment call. Depending on perspective, the author might be seen as justified or as having gone too far. But given the offensive actions of the girls, the author's decision to leave could be seen as reasonable. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
