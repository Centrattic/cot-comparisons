She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about ditching a prom date and another girl after a bad experience at a restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author set up a double date with his friend Luke for two girls. The girls were mean to Luke, making fun of his height and the restaurant. The girls were also rude, with one even calling the food \"Chink food.\" The author and Luke decided to take them to the school instead of the dance and kicked them out. Now the author is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Did the author have the right to ditch them? The author was trying to help the cleaning lady's daughter after she was left without a date. The other girl was a friend of the cleaning lady's daughter. The girls were clearly being unkind and disrespectful to Luke. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to take action. \n\nBut, was it right to abandon them? Legally, maybe not, but morally? The girls were being abusive. The author tried to warn them before the date that the friend was short, so he had a heads-up. However, by setting up the date, he may have felt responsible for the outcome. The girls might have known Luke's height but still made fun of him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't force them to go on the date. The cleaning lady asked him to find a date for the friend, which he did. The problem was the behavior of the girls. The author stood up for his friend, which is commendable. However, ditching them in the parking lot might have been an extreme reaction. Maybe he could have handled it differently, like confronting the girls directly or ending the date politely. But given the context, the girls were being cruel, so the author's action might be seen as a justified response to protect his friend from further humiliation. \n\nThe cleaning lady apologized, so she acknowledged the girls' bad behavior. The author's intention was to help and ended up standing up for Luke. So, he's probably not the asshole. The answer would be B (No).\n"
