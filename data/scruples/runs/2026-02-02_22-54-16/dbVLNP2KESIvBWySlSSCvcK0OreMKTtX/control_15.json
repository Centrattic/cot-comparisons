She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who agreed to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom, but then ended up ditching them because the girls were being mean to his friend. \n\nFirst, the author set up a date for his friend Luke, who's shorter, with the cleaning lady's daughter's friend, who's also very short. The problem starts when the date, the friend, makes fun of Luke's height and even calls the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is pretty offensive. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to take both girls back to the school and ditch them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing by cutting off the girls. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author did have prior knowledge that the cleaning lady's daughter's friend was short, and he matched her with Luke, who's also short. Maybe there was an expectation that they could relate, but instead, the friend was rude. The girls' behavior at dinner was pretty bad\u2014mocking Luke's height and using a racial slur. The author and Luke decided to walk out on them, which is understandable given the harassment.\n\nBut then, the author is now questioning if he was in the wrong. On one hand, the girls were being awful and the author protected his friend. On the other hand, the author and Luke decided to leave the girls stranded without warning. However, the cleaning lady did apologize later, acknowledging the girls' bad behavior. \n\nThe key points here are the harassment and the offensive remarks. The author's actions were a response to the girls' unacceptable behavior. It's a form of standing up for his friend, which is commendable. The girls were the ones in the wrong, so the author isn't necessarily the asshole here. The act of leaving them might have been harsh, but it was a reaction to their mistreatment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
