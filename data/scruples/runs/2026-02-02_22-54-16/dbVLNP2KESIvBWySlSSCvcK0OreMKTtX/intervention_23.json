She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The main points are:\n\n1. The author, through the cleaning lady, set up a double date with two girls. The cleaning lady's daughter and her friend needed dates. The author's friend Luke was chosen, probably because he's rich but shorter. The girls were supposed to go to prom with them.\n\n2. At dinner, the girls were mean to Luke, especially about his height. The friend's date even made a racist comment about the restaurant. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch the girls.\n\n3. They drove the girls to the school parking lot and told them they wouldn't be taking them to the dance. The girls were upset, and the cleaning lady later apologized.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are consent and the setup. The cleaning lady asked the author to find a date for her daughter, which he did. However, he didn't consider that Luke might be uncomfortable. The girls' behavior was inappropriate, and the author took action to protect his friend. But was it right to ditch them without a better plan? The author had a valid reason to be upset with the girls' behavior, but did he have the right to abandon them, even if they were unpleasant? \n\nEthically, the author might be seen as standing up for his friend, but he did leave them stranded. However, the girls had agreed to go with them, possibly without knowing the full context. The cleaning lady's involvement adds another layer\u2014she set this up, perhaps not considering the girls' personalities. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author was following through on the arrangement made by the cleaning lady. The girls' actions were problematic, but the author's decision to abandon them might be seen as a justified reaction to their behavior. However, leaving them stranded could be seen as a problem, as they were teenagers and not in a position to handle being stranded. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions were in response to the girls' unacceptable behavior towards his friend. He didn't want to subject Luke to further humiliation, so he took action to protect him. The cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests she didn't expect the girls to act that way. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because he was protecting his friend from bullying and inappropriate comments. The girls' actions were the root issue, and the author acted to prevent further harm. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
