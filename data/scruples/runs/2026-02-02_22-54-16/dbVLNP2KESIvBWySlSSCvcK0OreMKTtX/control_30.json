She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author was asked by their mom's cleaning lady to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom. The catch was that the daughter's friend, who's very short, also needed a date. The author asked their friend Luke, who's shorter and from a rich family, to be the date. They both took the girls to prom, but the girls were mean to Luke, especially at a Chinese restaurant. The girls made fun of Luke's height and called out the food. After enough, the author and Luke decided to ditch the girls at the school and drive off.\n\nNow, considering the actions: the author set up a situation where their friend was put in a bad position. The girls were being rude, and the author felt bad for Luke. They decided to end the date abruptly. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: Did the author have the right to ditch the girls, or was it a justified response to their behavior? The girls were clearly being unkind and disrespectful. The author tried to protect their friend, which could be seen as standing up for Luke. However, ditching someone without warning can be seen as rude and inconsiderate. But given the context, maybe the author had a valid reason.\n\nAlso, the cleaning lady admitted fault later, which might indicate that the girls were known for being trashy. The author might have felt that they couldn't control the girls' behavior and had to make a choice to protect their friend's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, ditching someone at an event like prom could leave them embarrassed or stranded. But in this case, they were taken to the school, and the author tried to handle it as gently as possible. It's a balance between standing up for their friend and being considerate of the girls' situation.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they acted to protect their friend from harassment, even if the method was abrupt. The key is that the girls were being unacceptably rude, and the author made a judgment call to stop the situation. The cleaning lady's apology also suggests that the author's actions were justified in the context.\n"
