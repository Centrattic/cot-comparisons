She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The scenario is a little complex, so I need to consider all the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's mom's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom and also find another date for the friend. The author approached their friend Luke, who was shorter and from a rich family. They set up a double date using Luke's dad's car. \n\nAt the restaurant, Luke's date made derogatory comments about the Chinese food and mocked Luke's height. The author's date also joined in. Luke was visibly upset. The author and Luke decided to ditch the girls and leave them at the school. The cleaning lady later apologized.\n\nSo, the key points here are the behavior of the girls, specifically their racist remark about the Chinese restaurant and the bullying of Luke. The author and Luke felt it was beyond unacceptable and took action. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to assess if their actions were justified. The girls were hostile and disrespectful, which could be a valid reason to leave. However, ditching someone mid-event, even if the other party was acting badly, might have its own ethical issues. \n\nBut in this case, the girls were abusive towards Luke, which might have crossed a line. The author stood up for their friend, which is a positive action. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating that the mother acknowledged the daughters' bad behavior. \n\nConsidering that the author's actions were in response to the girls' unacceptable behavior, it's possible that the author isn't the asshole here. The decision to leave was a reaction to the mistreatment of their friend, which is understandable. However, there's a part of me that wonders if there was another way to handle it without just ditching them. But given the circumstances, the author's actions seem justified as a self-defense and protection of their friend.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
