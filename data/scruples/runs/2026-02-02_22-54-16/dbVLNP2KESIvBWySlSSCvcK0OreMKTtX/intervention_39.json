She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves ditching a prom date and a friend's date after they made fun of the friend's height and were rude.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's mom asked him to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom, but with the caveat that the daughter's friend (who is very short) also needed a date. The author approached his friend Luke, who's shorter, to be the date for the friend. Luke agreed, and they set up a plan where they both would go to prom with their respective dates. \n\nThen, on prom day, the dates were rude. Luke's date made a derogatory comment about the Chinese restaurant, and both girls were making fun of Luke's height. The author felt bad and decided to ditch them, driving them to the school and kicking them out. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my take. I have to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nConsidering the circumstances: The author was tricked into setting up a date where his friend was the target of bullying. The girls were not just being rude, but specifically mocking Luke's height and the restaurant's name. The author and Luke intervened to stop the harassment. \n\nLegally, maybe not much to say here. Socially, though, it's a gray area. The author was following a request from his mother, but the setup was problematic. However, once the harassment started, the author took a stand. The key is whether the author acted in self-defense or was justified in protecting his friend. \n\nSince the girls were the ones acting inappropriately, and the author's actions were a response to their bullying, it's likely the author isn't the asshole. The cleaning lady's apology supports that the girls had it coming. The author probably did the right thing by standing up to them, even if the initial setup was a bit of a mistake. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
