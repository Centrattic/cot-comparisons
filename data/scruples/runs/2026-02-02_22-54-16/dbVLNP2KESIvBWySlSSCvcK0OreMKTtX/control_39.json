She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about ditching a prom date. The user set up a date for his friend Luke with the daughter of the cleaning lady and her friend. The problem starts when the girls are really mean to Luke during dinner, making fun of his height and calling the restaurant derogatory names. The user and Luke then decide to ditch them, leaving them at the school parking lot. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions. The user was asked by the cleaning lady to take the daughter to prom, and he arranged for Luke to take the friend. The girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate\u2014mocking Luke's height and using a racial slur. The user felt bad for Luke and decided to stand up to the girls by abandoning them. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. On one hand, he did set up the dates and might have a responsibility to see it through, but the girls were being abusive and derogatory. The user and Luke were protecting their friend from further humiliation. The user also informed the cleaning lady later, who apologized. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user didn't force the girls to go to dinner; they were volunteers. However, by orchestrating the plan to ditch them, he acted preemptively. But given the girls' misconduct, it could be seen as self-defense against their bullying. \n\nThe key points are the girls' behavior, the user's intent to protect his friend, and the fact that the cleaning lady later acknowledged the issue. So, the user might not be the asshole here. The answer is likely B.\n"
