She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The story is about the author taking a prom date for a cleaning lady's daughter and a friend, but then things go wrong when the dates are rude, especially to the friend. The author then decides to ditch them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author set up two dates: one for himself and one for his friend Luke. Luke's date was mean, calling him a jerk about his height and even using a racial slur at the restaurant. The author's date also joined in. So the girls were being really disrespectful. The author felt bad for Luke, especially when he was on the verge of tears. Then they decided to take the girls to the school and kick them out. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Were the girls in the wrong for being rude? Probably yes. But what about the author and Luke? They left the girls at the school. Is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to protect his friend from harassment. Standing up against bullying or disrespectful behavior is generally seen as the right thing. But on the other hand, taking someone out of a car and leaving them could be considered abandoning them, which might have its own issues. However, given the context of the girls being abusive, the author's actions might be seen as a form of self-defense or protecting a friend. \n\nThe mother of the cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests that the author's actions were justified in her eyes. Also, the author didn't just leave them stranded without a word; he explained his reasons, which shows they had a cause. \n\nI need to consider if there were any other options. Maybe the author could have tried to confront the girls more directly, but given the situation, the immediate action might have been the best to stop the harassment. The author and Luke were in a position of power with the car, so using that to remove the aggressors could be seen as reasonable.\n\nIn summary, the girls were clearly being rude and disrespectful, the author acted to protect his friend, and the cleaning lady's mother apologized. So the author likely isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
