She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about ditching a prom date after some pretty bad behavior by the date and her friend. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was asked by their mother's cleaning lady to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom. The daughter's friend also needed a date, so the author arranged for their friend Luke to go with her. Luke is described as a nice guy but shorter, and his family is wealthy. \n\nThen, on prom night, they go to a Chinese restaurant. The main issue starts here. Luke's date is making fun of him for being short, and the author's date is joining in. There's also an incident where the girl calls the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is a racist slur. The author feels embarrassed and is clearly upset about how Luke is being treated. After an hour and a half of this, they decide to take the girls to the school parking lot and kick them out of the car, leaving them stranded. \n\nNow, the key points here are the behavior of the girls, the author's reaction, and whether ditching them was justified. The girls were being derogatory about Luke's height and using a racist term. The author and Luke decided to leave them at the school. The author is now questioning if they were the asshole for doing that.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? Well, the girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. Making fun of someone's height and using a racist slur is unacceptable. The author was trying to protect their friend from being mistreated. However, ditching the girls without any warning could be seen as an extreme reaction. They did give the girls a chance to go to the dance, but instead, they left them stranded. \n\nOn one hand, standing up against bullying and racism is commendable. On the other hand, the method of response might have been harsh. The author could have tried to address the behavior at the table or left them at the restaurant, but taking them to the school and kicking them out might have been unnecessary. However, considering the context that the author was the one who set up the dates, maybe they felt responsible for the situation and wanted to protect their friend. \n\nThe cleaning lady apologized afterward, which suggests that the behavior was out of line. The author's actions were a response to protect their friend, which is understandable. While the method might have been a bit extreme, the intent was to stop the bullying. So, does that make the author the asshole? I think not. They were reacting to unacceptable behavior, even though their response might not have been the best. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
