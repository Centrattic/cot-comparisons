She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was asked by their mother's cleaning lady to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom. The catch was that the daughter's friend also needed a date, and the author found a friend, Luke, who was a bit shorter. The girls turned out to be rude, especially the friend, making fun of Luke's height and being disrespectful. The author and Luke decided to ditch the girls after the dinner, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author set up the dates with knowledge of the girls' backgrounds, including the friend's short stature. Luke's date was mean to him, and the author's date joined in. The author felt responsible for Luke's date's experience and took action by cutting the girls off mid-prom.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author didn't know the girls would behave that way, but once they did, they took a stand to protect their friend. The action of ditching them was a response to their unacceptable behavior. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating she acknowledged the problem.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be seen as standing up against bullying and protecting Luke. On the other hand, they did leave the girls stranded, which could be seen as harsh. But considering the context of the girls' behavior and the prior knowledge from the cleaning lady about the boyfriend being a problem, the author's actions might be justified.\n\nAlso, the cleaning lady had warned about her daughter's friend being short, which Luke accepted, but the girls still targeted him. The author felt bad for Luke and acted to stop the harassment. The girls were the ones at fault here for their actions, so the author's response was in self-defense and for Luke's sake.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't the asshole because they responded to being wronged. The answer should be B (No).\n"
