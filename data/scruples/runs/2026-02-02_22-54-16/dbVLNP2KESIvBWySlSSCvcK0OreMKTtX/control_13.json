She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about ditching a prom date after the date and her friend were rude to their friend Luke.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The main character (MC) was set up with the daughter of the cleaning lady, who had a friend who also needed a date. The MC asked his friend Luke to go with the friend. At the dinner, Luke's date was making fun of him for his height, and even called the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is racist. The MC's date also joined in. The MC and Luke decided to leave the girls at the school parking lot and not take them to the dance.\n\nNow, the question is whether the MC was in the wrong. On one hand, the girls were being mean and making Luke uncomfortable. The MC tried to stop it but when it didn't work, they decided to ditch them. On the other hand, ditching someone on prom night is a big deal. The MC did set things up, so maybe he's responsible. But the girls' behavior was pretty bad, and the MC was trying to protect his friend.\n\nThe MC did tell the cleaning lady later, and she apologized. So maybe he wasn't entirely at fault. The problem is whether the ditching was justified. The girls were disrespectful, but was the response appropriate? The MC didn't try to resolve the situation during dinner, maybe they could have left earlier instead of waiting until the end. However, considering the harassment Luke faced, the MC might have felt it was necessary to stop it. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the girls were the ones being rude, the MC might not be the asshole here.\n"
