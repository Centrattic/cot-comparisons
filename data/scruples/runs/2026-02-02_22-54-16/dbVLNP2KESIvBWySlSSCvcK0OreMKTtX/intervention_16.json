She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The story involves the author's friend Luke being set up with a date who was rude and insulting, including making fun of his height and the restaurant's menu. The author and Luke then decided to leave the girls at the school parking lot.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions. The girls were clearly being disrespectful, especially considering the derogatory comments about Luke's height and the racial slur (\"Chink food\") when they were at a Chinese restaurant. That's pretty hostile behavior. The author felt responsible for Luke's well-being and intervened to stop the abuse. \n\nBut wait, the author had agreed to take both dates. By ditching them, he's breaking a commitment. However, the context is important. The girls were being abusive, and Luke was visibly upset. The author's actions were to protect his friend. Is that justifiable? It's a tough call. Legally, maybe not, but in terms of moral judgment, it's more about protecting someone from being mistreated. \n\nThe cleaning lady's daughter and friend were not good people, as per the author's account and later the mother's apology. The author might have felt it was necessary to act to prevent further harm. The alternative would have been to let Luke endure more humiliation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the intent was to protect vs. abandoning the dates. The story presents the author as acting in self-defense and for his friend's sake. The girls' behavior was inexcusable. Therefore, the author's actions were a response to being treated badly, which might mitigate his responsibility. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He took a stand against unacceptable behavior, even if it meant breaking a social agreement.\n"
