She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's mom's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom. But there's a catch: the daughter's friend also needs a date, who's very short. The author finds a friend, Luke, who's shorter but a nice guy. So they set up a double date.\n\nOn prom night, they pick up the girls, go to a Chinese restaurant. The friend's date makes a racist comment about the restaurant being \"Chink food,\" and the daughter joins in making fun of Luke's height. The author feels bad for Luke, especially after an hour and a half of this behavior. They decide to ditch the girls at the school, refusing to take them to the dance because of their behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points here. The girls were being disrespectful and making fun of Luke, including using a racial slur. The author stood up for Luke, which is a positive action. However, ditching someone without a clear plan for their after-prom plans might have consequences. The author did try to inform the cleaning lady later, who apologized.\n\nBut were the author's actions justified? The girls were being inconsiderate and cruel. The author and Luke confronted them and decided to leave. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision. The author might have considered ensuring the girls had another way to get to the event, but given the circumstances, their primary concern was to protect Luke from further humiliation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author wasn't obligated to take the girls to prom, especially since the cleaning lady's daughter was the one who initially needed a date. The author's actions were a response to the girls' behavior, which was unkind. While ditching someone isn't ideal, the context here suggests that the author acted in defense of a friend. The cleaning lady even apologized later, acknowledging the daughters' behavior.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while abrupt, were in response to the girls' unkind actions. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
