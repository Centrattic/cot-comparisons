She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about ditching his prom date after a bad experience with both her and her friend. The main points to consider are the actions of the author and whether they were justified.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, and he arranged for his friend Luke to take the daughter's friend. The daughter's friend is described as very short, and Luke is on the shorter side. Then, during the dinner, Luke's date is rude, making fun of his height, and even insults the Chinese restaurant. The author's date also joins in. The author feels bad for Luke and decides to ditch them after an hour and a half. They drop the girls off at the school, inform them they won't take them to the dance due to their behavior, and the girls react angrily. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's actions.\n\nSo, the key issue here is whether the author was wrong to abandon his date. Let's break it down. The author's date (the daughter) was disrespectful to Luke, and her friend was even more so. The author, seeing his friend being treated poorly, decided to cut the evening short. The author didn't just leave without a reason\u2014he had a clear reason based on the girls' behavior. He even tried to stand up for Luke, which shows he was looking out for his friend's feelings. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating that she acknowledged the daughter's bad behavior.\n\nNow, considering the circumstances, the author faced a situation where he was part of an arrangement that he didn't initiate but was asked to help with. The girls' behavior was inappropriate, and the author's reaction was to protect his friend from further humiliation. Dropping them off might have been harsh, but the girls were already acting in a way that was causing distress. The author didn't have to continue the evening if it was making his friend uncomfortable. The fact that the cleaning lady apologized later suggests that the author's actions were justified, as the mother was aware of her daughter's \"trashy\" behavior.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: the author did agree to be the date, so maybe he should have handled the situation differently, like confronting the girls in a more respectful way or ending the date politely. But given that the girls were being openly rude and the author felt compelled to act to stop the harassment, his decision to leave might be seen as a necessary action to protect his friend's dignity.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" test, the question is whether the author's actions were inexcusable. The girls' behavior was the catalyst, and the author responded to protect his friend. While the method of ditching them might be abrupt, the intent was to stop the bullying, not to be malicious. The cleaning lady's apology also supports that the author wasn't entirely at fault. So, it seems like the author isn't the asshole here. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
