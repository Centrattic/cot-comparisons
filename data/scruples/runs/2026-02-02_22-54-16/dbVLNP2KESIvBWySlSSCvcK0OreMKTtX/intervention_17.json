She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is about a prom date setup by the author's mom's cleaning lady. The cleaning lady asked the author to take her daughter to prom, and also wanted him to find a date for the daughter's friend, who's very short. The author asked his friend Luke, who's shorter and from a rich family, to go with the friend. \n\nThen, on prom day, they all go to a Chinese restaurant. Luke's date, the friend, is being really rude, making fun of Luke's height. The author's date also joins in. The author feels bad for Luke and decides to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, refusing to take them to the dance. The girls get angry, and later the cleaning lady apologizes for her daughter's behavior.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to confirm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author was set up in a situation where he was asked to take two girls to prom. The cleaning lady's daughter had a friend who needed a date, and the author tried to help by involving Luke, who was a good guy but shorter. The girls' behavior toward Luke was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author observed this and decided to stand up for his friend, leading to the decision to ditch the girls.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, standing up against bullying or hurtful behavior is generally considered the right thing to do. The author didn't just leave without reason; he had a valid cause\u2014the girls were being cruel to Luke. The scenario shows that the girls were the ones being disrespectful, which could justify the author and Luke's actions. \n\nHowever, there's a social aspect to consider. Ditching someone at an event like prom can be seen as disrespectful, especially if done without prior warning. But in this case, the author had tried to handle it by talking to Luke and then taking action when the situation was ongoing and hurtful. The girls' own behavior might mitigate the author's responsibility here.\n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, indicating that she acknowledged her daughter's poor actions. This suggests that the author's decision had some validity, as the mother recognized the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have handled the situation differently, like confronting the girls directly or ending the date earlier. But given the immediate and public nature of the bullying, the author's quick response to protect his friend could be seen as justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted in response to the girls' mistreatment of his friend, which was a protective measure. The primary fault lies with the girls for their behavior, and the author's actions were a reasonable reaction to uphold respect and stop the harassment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
