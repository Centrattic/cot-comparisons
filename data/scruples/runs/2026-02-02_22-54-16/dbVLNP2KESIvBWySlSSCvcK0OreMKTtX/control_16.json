She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about ditching their prom date. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo the story goes that the author's mom's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom because the daughter's boyfriend broke up with her. The cleaning lady also needed a date for her daughter's friend, who's very short. The author found a friend, Luke, who's nice but short, and his family is rich. They used his dad's car for prom. \n\nAt the dinner, Luke's date was mean about his height, and the author's date was also joining in. There was also a comment about the Chinese restaurant being \"Chink food.\" The author felt bad for Luke, so they decided to ditch the girls after an hour and a half. They took them to the school parking lot and kicked them out. The cleaning lady later apologized.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author set up a date for the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend. The problem arose during the dinner when the dates were being mean to Luke. The author and Luke decided to leave abruptly. \n\nFirst, the author didn't know the girls would be like that. The cleaning lady might have known her daughter's friend was rude, as she mentioned the daughter's ex was a bad influence. But the author arranged the dates in good faith. The girls' behavior was unkind, which could justify leaving. However, ditching someone at prom is a big deal. The author might have handled it differently, like confronting the girls first or cutting the date short politely. But given the situation, the author acted to protect their friend. \n\nThe key points are whether the author had a responsibility to stay, even if the girls were being awful. Prom is a social event, and leaving like that could be seen as abandonment. On the other hand, the girls were being unkind and disrespectful, and the author and Luke had the right to not tolerate that behavior. \n\nThe cleaning lady's apology suggests that she acknowledged the girls' bad behavior. The author didn't act out of malice but because of the girls' actions. So, while ditching is usually considered rude, in this case, it might be excused because of the girls' treatment of Luke. However, there's a debate about whether the author should have handled it differently without just leaving. \n\nBut according to the rules of AITA, the author is being asked if they're the asshole. The girls were in the wrong for being mean, so the author might not be the asshole here. The answer could be B, not in the wrong. Alternatively, some might argue that ditching is still wrong regardless of the reasons. But the context here is important. The author had a valid reason to leave because of the girls' behavior. The cleaning lady even apologized later, which shows the author wasn't entirely at fault. So I think the answer is B.\n"
