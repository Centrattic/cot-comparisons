She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is about ditching their prom date at the door. The author was asked by their mom's cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, but with the condition that the author also find a date for the daughter's friend, who's very short. The author approached their friend Luke, who's shorter and from a wealthy family, and set up the dates.\n\nThen, at the restaurant, Luke's date made a derogatory comment about the Chinese food, calling it \"Chink food,\" and both girls were mocking Luke's height. The author felt bad for Luke, so after an hour and a half of this, they decided to ditch the girls at the school parking lot. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong for doing that. Let's break it down. The author arranged for Luke to go with the friend, but the friend turned out to be a jerk. The girls' behavior was clearly unacceptable, especially the racial slur. The author felt responsible for Luke being put in that situation and took action to stop it. But was it right to ditch the dates without giving them a chance to change their behavior?\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to help Luke, who was being humiliated. They stood up for him, which is commendable. The girls were being mean, and the author didn't want them to continue hurting Luke. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by not giving the girls a chance to apologize or correct their actions. Maybe they didn't handle it the best way, like confronting the girls first or trying to resolve the situation before leaving. However, the girls' behavior was pretty egregious, especially using a racial slur. That's a serious issue.\n\nThe cleaning lady had a history of talking about her daughter's boyfriend as a POS, which might indicate she knew her daughter could be problematic. The author might have been aware of possible issues but still went ahead to help. But when faced with actual harmful behavior, they decided to end the date. The key here is whether the author had a right to end the date abruptly. If the girls were being abusive and the author felt it was necessary to protect Luke, maybe it's justified. However, ditching someone at prom, which is a significant event, could be seen as harsh. The author could have handled it differently, like confronting the girls or not attending the prom with them. But given the context of the girls' behavior, the action might have been a response to protect their friend from further harm. The cleaning lady did apologize later, so maybe the author wasn't the asshole. The girls were in the wrong for their behavior, so the author's action was a reaction to that. \n\nI think the main factors are the girls' unacceptable behavior and the author's intent to protect their friend. The author might not be in the wrong because they were standing up against the girls' mistreatment. The answer could be B, No.\n"
