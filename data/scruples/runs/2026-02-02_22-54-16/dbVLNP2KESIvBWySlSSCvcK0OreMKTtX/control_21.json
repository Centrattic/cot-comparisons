She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. So the story is that the author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom. But there was a catch: the daughter's friend also needed a date. The author asked his friend Luke, who is shorter and from a wealthy family. Then, during the prom dinner, Luke's date is being really rude, making fun of him for being short, and even calling the Chinese restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author's date also joins in. The author and Luke get so fed up that they drive the girls to the school and kick them out.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of the author. The key points are the treatment of Luke by the girls and the author's decision to cut the date short. The author intervened when Luke was being harassed, which seems like a good intention. However, ditching the girls without a proper explanation might be problematic. \n\nBut considering the context: the girls were being abusive towards Luke, making him feel awful. The author tried to help a friend who was being mistreated. The action of leaving them at the school was a direct response to their behavior. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating she understood her daughter's actions were wrong. \n\nSo, the author's intent was to protect Luke from bullying. While the method of leaving abruptly might not be the best approach, the situation involved harassment. The author had the right to feel responsible for stopping the mistreatment. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The main issue was the girls' behavior, not the author's response.\n"
