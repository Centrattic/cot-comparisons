She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves setting up a date for a friend's daughter through a friend, but things go south because the date and her friend are rude.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, and also asked if he could find another date for the daughter's friend, who's very short. The author found his friend Luke, who's also short and from a rich family. They all went to a Chinese restaurant. The problem started when Luke's date was making fun of him for his height, and the author's date joined in. The menu comment was offensive, and after enduring the dinner, the author and Luke decided to ditch the girls at the school, refusing to take them to the dance.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author set up the dates, knowing that Luke was short and the girl was also short. The girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author intervened when they saw their friend being mistreated. The action taken was to leave them at the school, which is a strong move. But was that right?\n\nOn one hand, the author and Luke were the victims of bullying. The dates were rude and offensive. The author felt bad for Luke and acted to stop the abuse. That seems like a justified response. On the other hand, ditching someone at prom, even if they were acting badly, might be seen as harsh. However, the girls were the ones who started the problem, so the author's actions could be a form of self-defense or standing up against bullying.\n\nThe cleaning lady apologized later, acknowledging her daughter's behavior. The author is still feeling guilty, which shows they care about their actions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether their response was excessive. Since the girls were being cruel and the author tried to protect a friend, it's more likely that the author isn't the one at fault. The girls and their friend were the aggressors. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
