She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for ditching his prom date and his friend's date. \n\nFirst, the setup: the author agreed to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom, and he convinced his friend Luke to take the daughter's friend. The problem arises when Luke's date is rude and offensive, making fun of Luke's height and calling the restaurant names. The author and Luke then decide to ditch the girls and leave them at the school parking lot.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intention was to help the cleaning lady's daughter after her boyfriend left her. He set up the dates with Luke, who was a good friend. The issue started with the girls' behavior. The date's derogatory comments towards Luke were clearly unacceptable. The author felt responsible for protecting his friend from being humiliated. \n\nBut is ditching them the right response? Legally, they're just cutting the date short, but ethically, it's a bit tricky. Did the author have the right to decide their fate? The girls were being abusive, but was there a better way to handle it? The author could have intervened differently, like trying to stop the insults or walking out politely. However, considering the emotional state of Luke and the fact that the girls were being openly cruel, the author's actions might be seen as standing up against bullying.\n\nAlso, the cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests she saw the problem too. The author didn't plan to ditch them but reacted to the situation. So, while it was abrupt, the intent was to stop the harassment. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that ditching is still a form of abandonment. But given the circumstances, the author's decision to protect his friend and end the harmful behavior could be justified. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the actions were in response to the girls' misconduct and aimed at stopping further harm.\n"
