She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is the asshole (AITA) for ditching their prom date at the door. I need to determine if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's mother's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom because the daughter's boyfriend broke up with her. The cleaning lady also wanted the author to find a date for the daughter's friend, who is short. The author arranged for their friend Luke, who is shorter, to take the friend. \n\nOn prom night, things go wrong. Luke's date (the friend) is rude, making fun of Luke's height and calling the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author's date (the daughter) also joins in. After enduring this, the author and Luke decide to ditch the girls at the school, leading to the girls being upset and the author feeling guilty afterward.\n\nNow, considering the actions: The author set up a situation where they thought they were helping two girls by securing dates. However, the dates were made uncomfortable by the girls' behavior. The author and Luke stood up for their friend by cutting the night short. The key points here are intent and proportionality. \n\nThe author's intention was to help, and the response to the girls' cruelty was a stand against bullying. However, ditching the girls without a viable alternative might be seen as harsh. But given the context\u2014verbal abuse and public humiliation\u2014maybe the author's reaction is justified.\n\nWas there a better way? Perhaps, but the girls' behavior was inexcusable. The author isn't the one being mean; they're the one defending their friend. The cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging her daughter's trashiness. So, the author's actions seem selfless and protective. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
