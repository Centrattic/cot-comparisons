She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author ditching their prom date and a friend's date after both girls were rude to their dates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mother's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, and he arranged for his friend Luke to take the friend. The problem arises when the girls, especially Luke's date, are extremely disrespectful towards Luke and the food. The girls make fun of Luke's height and use offensive language. The author and Luke decide to cut the evening short, leaving the girls in the parking lot after the restaurant.\n\nThe key points here are the behavior of the girls. They were clearly being mean and derogatory. The author felt responsible for Luke and tried to protect him from the harassment. The decision to ditch the girls was a response to their unacceptable behavior. The cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging her daughter's actions.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, there's no issue because they didn't cause harm. Ethically, the author had the right to remove themselves from a hostile situation. However, some might argue that they could have handled it differently, like confronting the girls or ending the date politely. But given the context of harassment and the emotional impact on Luke, the author's actions seem justified as self-defense and protecting their friend. The alternative actions might not have been safe or effective in that moment.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the girls' behavior was inexcusable, and the author acted to stop the harassment.\n"
