She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who was set up by his mom's cleaning lady to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom. The catch was that he also had to find a date for the daughter's friend, who's really short. He asked his friend Luke, who's shorter and from a rich family, to go along. \n\nThe problem starts when they go to dinner. Luke's date is being a jerk, making fun of his height, and the author's date joins in. The menu comment about \"Chink food\" is pretty offensive. The author and Luke get upset, so they decide to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, refusing to take them to the prom. The author is now wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the initial setup. The cleaning lady asked the author to do this, and he agreed. He helped set up dates for both the daughter and her friend. That part seems okay, maybe even kind. But then the girls were being mean and rude to Luke. The author felt responsible for Luke's treatment and decided to take action. \n\nNow, ditching someone at a school parking lot is a serious action. Even if the girls were being jerks, was it right to just leave them without a way to get to the prom? They might have been unpleasant, but taking away their prom date entirely could be seen as harsh. However, the author had tried to intervene during dinner, and when the girls continued their behavior, he and Luke felt it was necessary to remove themselves from the situation.\n\nThe key here is the author's responsibility. He didn't force the girls to act that way, but he did set up the dates. By leaving them, he left them without a prom date. But the girls were the ones being offensive. The author might argue that he was protecting his friend from further humiliation. On the other hand, he could be seen as abandoning the girls, especially since they might not have had another way to get to prom.\n\nAlso, the cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests that even she thought the girls' behavior was unacceptable. The author's intention was to stop the bullying, which is a valid concern. However, the method of ditching them in the parking lot might be seen as extreme. Maybe there was a better way to handle it without leaving the girls stranded.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were motivated by stopping the mistreatment of his friend, which is understandable. But the consequences for the girls could be significant. If the author had at least tried to get them a ride or something, maybe it would be different. As it stands, he removed both the girls and his friend from the situation, but the girls were left in a bad spot.\n\nSo, is he the asshole? It's tricky. He might not be entirely in the wrong because the girls were being awful, but ditching them could be seen as going too far. Still, considering the circumstances and that the cleaning lady apologized, the author might not be the asshole. The answer is probably B (No), but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe there's a middle ground where he's not in the wrong because he was protecting his friend.\n"
