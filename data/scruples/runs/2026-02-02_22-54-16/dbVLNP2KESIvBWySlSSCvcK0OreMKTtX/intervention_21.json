She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ditching his prom date and his friend's date after a bad experience at a restaurant.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, and he arranged for his friend Luke to take the daughter's friend. The friend is short, and the cleaning lady mentioned the friend's height. Luke is also short but a nice guy from a wealthy family. They pick up the girls, go to a Chinese restaurant. The friend is rude about Luke's height, and the date joins in. There's an incident where one of the girls calls the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is a big no-no. The author feels awful for Luke and decides to cut the trip short, taking the girls to the school and leaving them. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nNow, considering the actions: The author and Luke stood up for themselves when faced with harassment. The girls were being unkind and using a racial slur, which is definitely inappropriate. The author's decision to leave was a response to protect his friend and himself from further humiliation. The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating she recognized the behavior was wrong.\n\nIs the author at fault? He was in a situation where he was set up with girls who were disrespectful. He didn't force them to be rude. His actions were a reaction to their behavior. The key point is that he took a stand against harassment. In many cases, people are encouraged to walk away from toxic situations. So, the author isn't the one in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
