She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did the right thing when they ditched their prom dates. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want to know my take.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author's mom's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom. The cleaning lady also mentioned a friend of the daughter who needed a date, so the author asked their friend Luke to be the other date. Luke's family was very rich, and they gave him a new car. \n\nThen, at the restaurant, Luke's date was really mean, making fun of his height. The author's date also joined in. The menu comment was offensive too. The author felt bad for Luke, so they decided to ditch the girls, take them to the school, and leave them. They told the cleaning lady later, who apologized.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the author have a right to abandon the dates? Was their action justified given the behavior of the girls?\n\nThe author and Luke were put into a situation where they were expected to go on prom dates with girls who were being hostile. The girls' behavior was disrespectful and hurtful. The author and Luke decided to leave, which they did. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's actions.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: They didn't confront the girls or give them a chance to apologize. They took a drastic action (ditching them) instead of trying to resolve the situation. However, the girls were being cruel, and the author was protecting their friend. Also, the cleaning lady knew her daughter could be \"trashy,\" so maybe the author wasn't entirely surprised.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have to endure the abuse. Standing up for Luke and themselves by leaving seems reasonable. Abusing someone's height and making racist comments is not okay. The author and Luke were victims of the girls' behavior, so leaving was a way to stop it.\n\nThe cleaning lady's daughter and her friend were the ones in the wrong, but the author might be seen as taking control of the situation. However, ditching someone mid-event could be seen as harsh. But considering the context, it's hard to blame the author. They prioritized their friend's well-being and their own comfort. The cleaning lady did apologize later, which implies she saw their side.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
