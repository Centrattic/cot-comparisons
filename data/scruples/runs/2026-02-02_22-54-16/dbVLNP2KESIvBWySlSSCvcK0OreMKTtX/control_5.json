She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is an asshole for ditching their prom date after her friend was rude to his friend. So, the setup was that the cleaning lady wanted the author to take her daughter to prom, but also needed a date for the daughter's friend. The author asked a friend, Luke, who was shorter and from a wealthy family. \n\nOn prom night, Luke's date was mean about his height and even called the restaurant \"Chink food.\" The author's date also laughed at this. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch them after an hour and a half, taking them to the school and kicking them out of the car.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. The key points are the behavior of the girls, the author's actions in response, and the context of the setup. The author tried to help the cleaning lady's daughters by finding dates, but the dates were treated poorly. The author stood up for Luke, who was being harassed. So, the author is defending a friend from bullying, which is understandable. However, ditching someone at prom could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since the author's date was part of the issue. But the friend was the one being targeted, and the author felt responsible. \n\nThe cleaning lady acknowledged the problem, so maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The main issue is whether the action was justified given the circumstances. Since the girls were the ones acting poorly and the author was protecting his friend, it's more about standing up against bullying. Therefore, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
