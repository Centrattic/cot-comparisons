She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is the asshole for ditching their prom date. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: the narrator's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom. The cleaning lady also wanted the narrator to find a date for her daughter's friend, who's very short. The narrator asked his friend Luke, who's nice but short and from a wealthy family. Luke agreed, thinking he was going to take the friend. \n\nOn prom night, they pick up the girls. The restaurant part is where things go wrong. Luke's date is rude, making fun of his height, and the narrator's date joins in. There's also an offensive comment about the Chinese restaurant. The narrator feels bad for Luke, and they decide to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, refusing to take them to the dance. The girls were upset, but the cleaning lady apologized later.\n\nNow, the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe narrator set up this date arrangement with the knowledge that Luke was short and the friend was also short. The girls' behavior towards Luke was clearly inappropriate. The narrator couldn't stand it and decided to leave. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the narrator stood up for his friend when Luke was being bullied. The girls were acting disrespectfully, so the narrator's actions were a response to that. However, ditching someone on prom night is a big deal. The narrator did promise to take them, so breaking that could be seen as inconsiderate. But on the other hand, the girls' behavior was unacceptable. \n\nAlso, the cleaning lady had a history of a problematic boyfriend, which might indicate that the daughter could be similar. The narrator tried to protect Luke from a bad situation. \n\nSo, was the narrator wrong? If someone is being harassed, standing up for them is right. The narrator didn't know what would happen at prom but acted when it was happening. However, they could have tried to de-escalate the situation instead of leaving abruptly. But given the circumstances, it's understandable. \n\nIn the end, the cleaning lady apologized, which suggests she saw the girls' behavior as wrong too. The narrator's actions were a last resort after witnessing the bullying. So, probably not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
