She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about ditching prom dates after a bad experience.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom, and in the process, also arrange for a date for the daughter's friend. The author found a friend, Luke, who was nice but shorter. The dates turned out to be problematic: Luke's date was rude, making fun of his height, and even calling the Chinese restaurant's food \"Chink food.\" The author felt bad for Luke, so they decided to ditch the girls and take them back to school, which upset the girls and their mother apologized later.\n\nThe key points here are: the dates were mean to Luke, the author stood up for their friend, and they left the girls. The author is wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nNow, considering the options. Answer A is yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer B is no. \n\nOn one hand, ditching someone at prom might be seen as inconsiderate or rude. But on the other hand, the girls were being really mean and discriminatory, especially with the racial slur. The author and Luke were protecting their friend from further humiliation. The cleaning lady already knew her daughter was trashy and apologized. The action was a form of standing up against bullying, even if it was a harsh method.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently, like confronting the girls first or trying to remove them from the situation without ditching. However, the immediate reaction was to stop the abuse towards Luke. The story mentions that the girls were screaming and swearing after being kicked out, but the author didn't back down.\n\nLegal or ethical wrongs? Probably not, since it's a personal decision between people. The main question is whether it was the right thing to do morally. The author's intent was to protect their friend, which is commendable. The outcome was that the mother apologized, indicating that the action was justified.\n\nSo, considering all, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
