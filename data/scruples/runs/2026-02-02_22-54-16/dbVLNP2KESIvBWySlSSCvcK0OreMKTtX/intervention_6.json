She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date after the girls acted poorly towards Luke. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author's mother's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom, and also to find a date for the daughter's friend, who's very short. The author found Luke, a friend who's shorter but nice. They all went to a Chinese restaurant, where the dates made fun of Luke for his height and even called the food \"Chink food.\" The author felt bad for Luke and decided to leave the girls there at the school parking lot, not taking them to the dance.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they were wrong. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. \n\nLet me break this down. The key points here are the behavior of the girls. Making fun of someone's height and using a racial slur are definitely inconsiderate and mean. The author noticed this and felt it was unacceptable, so they took action to protect their friend. \n\nHowever, the author was supposed to be the date for one of the girls. By ditching them, they broke their promise. But the reason was because the girls were being cruel. So, was that a justified reason? \n\nOn one hand, the author had a responsibility to their date, but on the other hand, the girls were acting in a way that was hurtful. The author stood up for their friend and left the situation. It's a tricky balance. \n\nBut considering that the girls were the ones who initiated the bad behavior, and the author acted to stop the harassment, it's more of a self-defense situation. The author didn't start any of it; they just took a stand against the girls' poor treatment of Luke. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is protecting their friend from bullying, which is a positive action. The girls were in the wrong for their comments, so the author isn't the one at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be that the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author should have talked to the girls first before leaving? Maybe they could have addressed the behavior directly. However, the situation was escalating, and the girls were unapologetic. The author and Luke decided to leave before things got worse. \n\nAnother angle: the author was in a position where they were set up to be a date for someone else's daughter. The cleaning lady might have known her daughter's tendency to be \"trashy,\" as she admitted later. The author might have had some role in choosing Luke as a date, but given that the friend was short, it's understandable. \n\nIn conclusion, the main issue was the girls' behavior, and the author's response was a reaction to that. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
