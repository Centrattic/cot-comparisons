She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong by ditching their prom date. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup. The author's mom's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom. There was also a friend, Luke, who was short and had family money. The cleaning lady's daughter's friend, who is very short, was also supposed to go with Luke. So the author arranges for Luke to be the date for the friend. \n\nNow, on prom day, they pick up the girls and go to a Chinese restaurant. The problem starts here. Luke's date is being a jerk, making fun of his height. The author's date joins in sometimes. There's an incident where Luke's date calls the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is pretty offensive. The author feels bad for Luke, who is getting picked on. After an hour and a half, they decide to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, refusing to take them to the dance. The girls get angry, but they stick to their decision.\n\nThe author is now wondering if they were wrong to do this. So, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the arguments.\n\nOn one hand, the author and Luke were in a situation where they were being treated disrespectfully. The girls were making fun of Luke's height and using a racial slur. It's understandable that they would want to leave such a toxic environment. The author tried to handle it by talking to Luke, and they both decided to stand up for themselves. The cleaning lady even apologized later, acknowledging her daughter's behavior. In this case, the author might have acted in self-defense against the girls' bullying.\n\nOn the other hand, ditching someone at prom could be seen as abandoning them. However, the context here is that the girls were being abusive and offensive. The author's decision could be seen as protecting Luke from further humiliation and refusing to tolerate disrespect. The act of leaving might be justified as they were not the ones acting inconsiderately; the girls were. Also, the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend had a history of problematic behavior (the boyfriend was a \"POS,\" etc.), so the author might have anticipated some issues but still agreed to help, only to face more than expected.\n\nAnother angle: The author isn't the one who was being bullied. Luke was the target, and the author stepped in to support him. By leaving, they were taking a stand against the girls' behavior. It's possible that the author was in the right to prioritize their friend's well-being and their own dignity over keeping the dates for the prom.\n\nBut wait, what about the dates themselves? The author was set up by the cleaning lady, so maybe there was an obligation? However, the obligation might be overridden by the girls' unacceptable behavior. The author did inform the cleaning lady later, and she apologized, which suggests that she understood her daughter's actions were wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were in a situation of being mistreated and took a stand. The answer should be B (No).\n"
