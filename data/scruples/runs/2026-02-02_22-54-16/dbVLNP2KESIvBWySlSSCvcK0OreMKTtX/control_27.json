She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The story is about ditching a prom date after her friend was rude to his friend. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The cleaning lady asked the author to take her daughter to prom, along with the daughter's friend. The author arranged for his friend Luke to date the friend. On the day of prom, Luke's date made derogatory comments about his height and the restaurant's food. The author and Luke decided to ditch the girls after an hour and a half, leading to the girls being upset.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author was wrong for ditching them. The author felt responsible for Luke being treated poorly and took action to stop the situation. However, ditching the date could be seen as abandoning them, which might be considered disrespectful. But the girls' behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful to Luke, so the author's decision might be seen as standing up for a friend.\n\nI need to consider if the author had a duty to stay with his date despite the behavior. The cleaning lady set up the arrangement, so the author might have a responsibility to his date. On the other hand, the girls' conduct was clearly inappropriate, and the author acted to protect his friend. \n\nAnother angle is consent and communication. The author didn't consult the girls before leaving, which could be an issue. However, the girls were the ones who were rude first. The author apologized to the cleaning lady later, showing he felt responsible.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who acted inconsiderately. Here, the girls were the ones making Luke uncomfortable. The author's action, while abrupt, was a response to their behavior. Therefore, the author might not be the asshole because he was protecting a friend from being mistreated. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
