She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. So, the situation is that the author was set up with a girl by their mom's cleaning lady, who also wanted the author to find a date for the friend. The friend is short, and the author's friend Luke was chosen because he's rich but also shorter. Then, during prom, Luke's date is rude about his height, and the author's date joins in. They make a lot of derogatory comments, including a racial slur when they're at a Chinese restaurant. The author and Luke then decide to ditch the girls.\n\nSo, the author is wondering if they're the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of the author. The key points here are the behavior of the girls, the author's response, and the consequences. The girls were being mean to Luke, making fun of his height and even using a racial slur. The author was embarrassed and felt bad for Luke. They decided to confront the girls and then leave them at the school. \n\nIs ditching them acceptable? Well, the girls were being unkind and disrespectful. The author didn't tolerate their behavior and took action after the girls were abusive. However, ditching someone could be seen as a harsh response. But in this case, the girls were the ones acting inappropriately. The author might have overstepped by taking matters into their own hands, but the alternative is enduring a night of being mocked. \n\nAlso, the author informed the cleaning lady about the incident, and she apologized. So maybe the author wasn't wrong in their actions, especially since the girls were the ones in the wrong. The author's actions were a reaction to being mistreated. \n\nBut is there a better way to handle it? Maybe confronting the girls then and there, but once the girls decided to be hostile, the author and Luke had the right to remove themselves. So, the author isn't the asshole here because they were responding to the girls' unacceptable behavior. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
