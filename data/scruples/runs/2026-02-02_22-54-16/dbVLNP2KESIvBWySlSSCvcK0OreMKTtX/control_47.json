She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe author was asked by their mother's cleaning lady to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom. The catch was that the daughter's friend also needed a date, and the friend is very short. The author found a date for the friend, Luke, who is also on the shorter side but a good kid from a wealthy family. \n\nOn prom night, they pick up both girls, go to a Chinese restaurant. The friend immediately insults the food, calling it \"Chink food,\" and throughout dinner, she mocks Luke's height. The daughter joins in here and there. The author feels bad for Luke, who's near tears. They decide to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, refusing to take them to the dance because of their behavior. The girls are upset, and the cleaning lady later apologizes for her daughter's actions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author set up this arrangement with the cleaning lady, knowing the friend was short. The friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate and unkind towards Luke. The author and Luke stood up for themselves and left the situation, which could be seen as standing up against bullying. The cleaning lady even apologized later, indicating she recognized the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did ditch the girls, which is a breach of social expectations. They had a plan to take them to prom, and instead, they left them. However, the context is important here. The girls were being cruel, and the author's actions could be seen as a response to protect their friend. The author might argue that they were in the right to leave when faced with such disrespect.\n\nThe key points here are consent and intent. The girls were taken to prom under the assumption that they would be going together. However, their behavior was unacceptable, and the author felt compelled to leave. The author's actions were in response to the girls' mistreatment of Luke. In this case, the author's decision to leave might be justified as self-defense and protecting a friend, even though it resulted in ditching the dates.\n\nAdditionally, the cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests that the author's actions were understood as a necessary response to the girls' behavior. The author's main concern was preventing further humiliation of Luke, which is a valid reason. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't the asshole. They acted to stop bullying and protect their friend, even if it meant going against the original plan. The answer should be B.\n"
