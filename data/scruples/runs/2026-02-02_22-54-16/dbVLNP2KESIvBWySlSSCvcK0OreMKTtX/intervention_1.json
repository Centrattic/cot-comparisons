She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date after a bad experience. The situation involves the author's friend Luke being set up with a date by their mom's cleaning lady. The problem starts when Luke's date and the author's date start mocking Luke's height and making derogatory comments. The menu comment is also a big issue. The author and Luke then decide to dump the girls at the school, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the key points to consider: the girls were acting unkindly towards Luke, which was causing him distress. The author felt responsible because they had set up the dates. The decision to leave was made to protect Luke from further humiliation. The author's actions were a response to the girls' unacceptable behavior. \n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging her daughter's trashy behavior. The author's main concern is whether they were wrong to leave despite the bad conduct. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author and Luke were standing up against bullying. The girls were in the wrong for their actions. The author didn't abandon them without reason; they had a valid cause to leave. The cleaning lady's apology supports the idea that the girls deserved the consequence. \n\nHowever, one might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like confronting the girls first or not setting up the dates in the first place. But given the circumstances\u2014seeing a friend being emotionally harmed\u2014it's understandable they took action. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions were a justified response to the girls' behavior.\n"
