She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking whether they were the asshole for ditching their prom date. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the user was asked by their mom's cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom, with the caveat that the daughter's friend also needed a date. They arranged for their friend Luke to go with the friend. Now, Luke is shorter, and the friend was also short. \n\nAt the prom dinner, Luke's date starts making fun of his height, and the user's date joins in. There's also an incident where the girl calls the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is racist. The user and Luke decide to ditch the girls because their behavior was intolerable. \n\nSo, the user is now wondering if they were wrong. The key points here are the girls' disrespectful and racist behavior towards Luke. Insulting someone's height and using a racial slur is definitely unacceptable. The user and Luke stood up for Luke by leaving the situation, which could be seen as standing up against bullying.\n\nHowever, ditching someone at prom is usually considered a major breach of social etiquette. Even if the girls were being jerks, walking out on them might leave them stranded and could be seen as cruel. But the user argues that the girls were the ones being cruel first. \n\nOn one hand, the user had the right to protect their friend from harassment. On the other hand, they took a drastic action that could have left the girls in a bad spot. The cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging her daughter's behavior. \n\nSo, the question is whether the user's action was justified. The girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate, but the response was to abandon them. It's a tough call. If someone is being harassed, it's reasonable to remove oneself from the situation. But the user could have considered other options, like leaving the table or not going with them, rather than ditching them at the school. But given the context, maybe there wasn't time to think of alternatives. \n\nIn the end, the user's intent was to stop the bullying, which is a good reason. The fact that the cleaning lady apologized suggests that the user had valid concerns. So, maybe the user isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
