She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is about ditching a prom date. The author was set up by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom because the daughter's ex was a problem. The catch was that the author also had to find a date for the daughter's friend, who's really short. The author's friend Luke, who's nice but short and rich, agreed to go along.\n\nNow, the main issue is what happened at the restaurant. Luke's date immediately calls out the restaurant as \"Chink food,\" which is a racist slur. The other girl, the author's date (the daughter), laughs and joins in, making fun of Luke's height. The author and Luke can't take it anymore, so they ditch the girls at the school and leave them there. The author is now wondering if ditching them was the right move.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. First, did the author do something wrong? Well, the key points here are the behavior of the girls and the author's response. The initial setup was that the author was helping out because the daughter was left without a date. The author's friend Luke was also being set up with the short girl. The problem arises when the girls are being rude to Luke and the author.\n\nThe racist comment at the start is a major red flag. Using a derogatory term like \"Chink food\" is clearly offensive. Then, the ongoing teasing about Luke's height, which is another form of bullying. The author felt that Luke was being treated unfairly and decided to take action. They confronted the girls, and then decided to ditch them. \n\nNow, the question is: is ditching them the wrong thing to do? Well, the girls were acting in a way that was cruel and disrespectful. The author and Luke were in a situation where they were being humiliated. By standing up to the girls and leaving, they were protecting Luke's feelings. The author even tried to resolve it by talking to Luke before the plan to ditch them. \n\nHowever, ditching someone, even if they're being jerks, is a serious action. It could be seen as abandoning their commitments, especially since the author had agreed to take them to prom. But on the other hand, the girls were the ones who behaved badly. The author's actions were a response to harassment. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girls' behavior was definitely wrong. The author's actions were a reaction to being treated poorly. The key is whether the author had a right to leave in those circumstances. Since the girls were the ones being abusive, the author's decision to end the date might be justified. The cleaning lady even apologized later, which suggests she saw her daughter's misbehavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't the asshole. They stood up against bullying and protected their friend. The answer should be B.\n"
