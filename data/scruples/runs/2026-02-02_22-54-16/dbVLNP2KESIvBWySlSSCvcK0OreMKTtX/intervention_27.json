She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong based on the given situation. The person had set up dates for their friend Luke and another girl, but during prom, Luke's date and the other girl were being really rude to Luke. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch them at the school, not taking them to the dance. Now they're wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions and intentions. The author's main motivation was to protect their friend Luke from being harassed. The girls were making fun of Luke's height, which is a sensitive issue, especially for a teenager. The situation escalated to the point where the author felt it was necessary to stop the abuse, even if it meant breaking their commitment to take them to prom. \n\nOn one hand, the author did go along with the plan to take the girls, but when they saw the girls being unkind, they took action to prevent further harm. The mother had a role in setting this up, possibly unaware of her daughter's behavior. The author's decision to leave was to protect their friend's emotional well-being and dignity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did break their promise to the girls, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the girls' behavior was inexcusable, and the author's response was a form of self-defense for Luke and themselves, as they were embarrassed and upset by the girls' actions. The fact that the cleaning lady later apologized suggests that the mother recognized her daughter's faults, implying some accountability on her part too.\n\nThe key factors here are the intent to prevent harm versus breaking a commitment. The author's actions were driven by a desire to stop the harassment, which is a valid reason. The decision to walk out was a reasonable response given the circumstances, even if it wasn't the easiest choice. The girls' behavior was inexcusable, and the author's intervention prevented Luke from being further humiliated.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were justified in protecting their friend and themselves from the girls' toxic behavior. While they did break their promise, the context of the abuse makes their decision understandable and morally sound. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
