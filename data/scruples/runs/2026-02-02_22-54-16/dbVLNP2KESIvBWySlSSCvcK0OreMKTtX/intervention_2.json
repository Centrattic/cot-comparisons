She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user set up a scenario where they were asked by their mother's cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom. The catch was that the cleaning lady also wanted the author to find a date for the daughter's friend, who's very short. The author then asked their friend Luke, a nice guy but shorter and from a wealthy family. They borrowed Luke's family's car for prom night.\n\nAt the restaurant, Luke's date was being a jerk, making fun of his height. The author's date also joined in. The food was Chinese, and the girl made a racist comment about it. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch the girls after an hour and a half. They drove them to the school and left them there, not going to the dance. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nLet me break this down. The author was set up by the cleaning lady, who knew her daughter and friend's reputations. The author might have thought they were helping a good cause but ended up in a bad situation. The girls were mean to Luke, making fun of his height and the restaurant. The author and Luke decided to leave the girls stranded, which is a big decision.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know the girls would be that rude. They were acting on the cleaning lady's request, possibly without full knowledge of the girls' behavior. The cleaning lady might have been aware of her daughter's and her friend's tendency to be trashy but still asked the author to set them up.\n\nWhen the girls acted out, the author defended Luke's dignity by cutting the date short. But ditching someone at prom is a big deal. The author and Luke left the girls stranded, which could be seen as cruel or justified. However, the girls were abusive towards Luke, so the author might feel they had no choice.\n\nBut legally and socially, ditching someone you're supposed to take to an event is generally frowned upon. However, in this case, the girls were in the wrong for their behavior. The author might have felt it was necessary to protect Luke and stop the harassment. The cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests she acknowledged the girls' behavior.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to the girls' unacceptable behavior. They weren't the ones who initiated the meanness. The key points here are: were the girls in the wrong for their behavior, and did the author have a right to act to stop it?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author wasn't the one being harassed. They were trying to help their friend, who was being targeted. The decision to leave was made to protect Luke's emotional well-being. However, the act of ditching the girls could be seen as a breach of social contract, but given the context, it's a self-defense against bullying.\n\nThe cleaning lady set up the situation without fully informing the author about the girls' tendencies, which might have been a factor. The author might not be in the wrong because they acted in response to the girls' misconduct. The question is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions were a response to the girls' behavior, and they might not be entirely at fault. The girls were the ones acting disrespectfully. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
