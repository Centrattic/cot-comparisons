She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did something wrong by ditching their prom date and their friend. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's mother's cleaning lady asked them to take her daughter to prom, and also to find a date for the daughter's friend, who is very short. The author approached their friend Luke, who is shorter and from a wealthy family, to be the date for the friend. So far, the setup seems okay. The author had good intentions, trying to help out.\n\nNow, on prom day, they pick up the girls. The first problem comes when Luke's date calls the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is a racist slur. The author's date, the daughter of the cleaning lady, seems to be joining in the teasing about Luke's height. This is clearly disrespectful and hurtful. The author feels bad for Luke, who is being treated poorly. \n\nThe author decides that they've had enough and convinces Luke to take the girls to the school parking lot and dump them off. The girls react angrily, and the author tells their cleaning lady later, who apologizes for her daughter's behavior. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the girls were being offensive, the author and Luke stood up for Luke by leaving, and the cleaning lady admitted the daughter's behavior was bad. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girls were being cruel and the author took a stand against that, maybe they weren't wrong. However, ditching someone at a school event could be seen as a breach of trust or betrayal, especially if the author had already agreed to take them. But in this case, the girls were being mean, so maybe the author had a valid reason to protect Luke and themselves from further humiliation.\n\nAnother angle: the author set up this arrangement with the cleaning lady, knowing the friend was short, but didn't realize how the girls would act. Luke's date's initial comment about \"Chink food\" is a major issue, showing racism and bigotry. The author's actions might be justified as standing up against intolerance and bullying. \n\nBut maybe the author should have handled it differently, like confronting the girls first or not going along with the plan in the first place. However, given the circumstances and the immediate action taken when the behavior became unacceptable, the author's decision to leave seems like a response to a hostile situation. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they were protecting Luke and themselves from a hostile environment. The girls' actions were inexcusable, and the author taking a stand against that could be seen as the right thing to do. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
