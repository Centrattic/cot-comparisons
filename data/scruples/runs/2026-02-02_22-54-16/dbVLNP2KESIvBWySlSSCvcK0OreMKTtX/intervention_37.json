She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves a cleaning lady asking the author to accompany her daughter and the daughter's friend to prom. The friend is described as very short, and the author's friend Luke, who is also short, ends up being mocked by the girls during dinner. The author and Luke decide to leave them at the school parking lot, leading to the girls being upset and the cleaning lady later apologizing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was set up in a situation where they were supposed to take two girls to prom, but the friend they brought (Luke) was being harassed for his height. The girls also made a derogatory comment about Chinese food. The author felt responsible and decided to stand up for Luke by ending the evening early and leaving the girls stranded. The cleaning lady later apologized for her daughter's behavior.\n\nSo, the main issues are consent and responsibility. Did the author have the right to make that decision? They were acting as a friend to Luke, which is understandable. The girls' behavior was clearly disrespectful and hurtful. The author wasn't obligated to subject Luke to that treatment. However, the author had agreed to be a date for the cleaning lady's daughter, so there's an expectation of being there for the entire event. \n\nBut wait, maybe the cleaning lady didn't realize the setup was problematic. The author and Luke arranged the dates with the understanding that they were both dates for the girls. If the girl's friend was particularly short and the author's friend was also short, maybe the author knew this could be an issue. However, the girls' actions were still inconsiderate. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to protect him, which could be seen as a kind gesture. \n\nOn the other hand, ditching someone at prom could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the cleaning lady's daughter was expecting to go to the prom. The author's friend Luke might have been in a tough spot too. But the girls were the ones making the situation unbearable. The author and Luke made a choice to prioritize Luke's well-being over the obligation to the girls. \n\nThe cleaning lady did apologize after the fact, which suggests that she might have realized the daughters' behavior was inappropriate. The author's actions could be seen as standing up for a friend and not allowing them to be humiliated. However, the act of leaving them at the school parking lot without proper notice might be harsh. But given the circumstances, it's a reaction to being treated poorly. \n\nI think the key here is the intentional setup. The author might have known that combining two short guys with girls who could be judgmental was risky. But the girls' actual behavior was worse than anticipated. The author took responsibility for Luke's date by helping him escape the toxic situation. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting a friend from bullying and stood up for them, even if it meant breaking the agreement with the cleaning lady's daughter. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like confronting the girls more directly or not involving Luke in the first place. However, the story shows that the author tried to resolve it by talking to Luke first and then acting to stop the harassment. The cleaning lady's later apology also indicates that the author might have done the right thing in the end.\n"
