She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's mother's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, and as part of the deal, the author also arranged a date for the daughter's friend for his friend Luke. The problem arises when the dates behave poorly, especially making fun of Luke's height and using offensive language at a Chinese restaurant. The author and Luke decide to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The girls were disrespectful, making fun of Luke's height and using a racial slur. The author felt it was unacceptable and decided to leave. Legally, you can't force someone to stay in a situation where they're being harassed. However, socially, the question is whether the author overstepped by taking such action. \n\nThe author had a responsibility to both Luke and the cleaning lady. By ditching the girls, he might have violated some social norms or expectations, especially since they were under his care for the evening. However, the girls' behavior was inexcusable. The author and Luke had the right to prioritize their comfort and safety, especially when the girls were being hostile. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author have a duty to try and resolve the situation in a different way? Maybe he could have tried to address the girls' behavior more directly before leaving, but the situation escalated to the point where they felt they couldn't continue. The author's actions were a response to the harassment, which could be seen as justified. \n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests that she recognized the girls' bad behavior. This might indicate that the author wasn't entirely at fault. \n\nBut some might argue that ditching someone at prom is a breach of etiquette, regardless of the circumstances. However, the key here is the context of harassment. The author's decision was to protect his friend and himself from further humiliation. \n\nIn conclusion, while ditching someone is generally frowned upon, the circumstances here involve harassment and disrespect. The author's actions were a reasonable response to protect himself and his friend from a hostile environment. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
