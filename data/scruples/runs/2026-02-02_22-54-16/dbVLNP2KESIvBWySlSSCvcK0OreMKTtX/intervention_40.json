She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves ditching a prom date after a bad experience.\n\nFirst, the author was set up by the cleaning lady to take the daughter to prom. The cleaning lady also asked him to find a date for the daughter's friend, who is short. The author's friend Luke, who is shorter, agreed to go with her. The prom date went bad when Luke's date was rude about his height, and the author's date also joined in. There were insulting remarks about the restaurant being called China Palace. The author and Luke then decided to ditch the girls and leave them at the school parking lot.\n\nThe author feels guilty but wants to know if he's the asshole. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nTo decide between A and B, I need to consider the ethics here. The author didn't force the girls to go with Luke and the author. They had voluntarily agreed to go. The problem was the girls' behavior towards Luke. The author stood up for his friend, which could be seen as justified. However, ditching them might have been a harsh reaction. But given the context of the girls' behavior, it could be seen as protecting Luke and standing up against bullying. The cleaning lady later apologized, which suggests some acknowledgment of the girls' bad behavior.\n\nSo, the author's actions were in response to the girls' unkind behavior. While ditching them might be seen as extreme, it could be considered a justified stand against the harassment of a friend. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
