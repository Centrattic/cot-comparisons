She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about ditching prom dates. The author set up his friend Luke to go with the cleaning lady's daughter's friend, who was short. The problem started when the dates were being really rude to Luke, especially at the Chinese restaurant. The main issue is whether the author did the right thing by cutting the prom short and leaving them at the school.\n\nFirst, the author was asked by the cleaning lady to take the daughter to prom. He found a date for the friend, Luke, thinking he was a good match. But then the dates were mean to Luke, making fun of his height and even using a racial slur at the restaurant. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch them. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the factors. The dates' behavior was clearly unkind and inappropriate. Making fun of someone's height and using a derogatory term like \"Chink\" is offensive. The author and Luke tried to stand up for themselves and protect their friend. They even tried to handle it by confronting the girls and then decided to leave when things didn't improve. \n\nHowever, ditching someone, even in response to bad behavior, is a breach of social trust. The girls might have overreacted, but the author's decision to abandon them could be seen as a violation of their agreement to take them to prom. Even if the dates were awful, the author could have considered other options, like leaving the dinner early but still taking them to the dance, or talking to the cleaning lady immediately. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author was protecting his friend from emotional harm. The behavior of the dates was unacceptable, and it's possible that continuing the date would have been worse for Luke. The author might have felt that cutting it off was necessary to prevent further humiliation. The cleaning lady even apologized later, which suggests that she acknowledged the daughters' poor behavior. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author acted to help a friend and stop bullying, but he also left the dates stranded. However, the context of the dates' behavior might justify his actions. The key point is whether ditching them was the only option. If the author had other ways to handle it without abandoning them, maybe he's at fault. But given the circumstances, his actions seem to be a reaction to their poor treatment of his friend. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the dates were the ones being unkind and the author was protecting his friend. The situation justified his decision despite the inconvenience caused.\n"
