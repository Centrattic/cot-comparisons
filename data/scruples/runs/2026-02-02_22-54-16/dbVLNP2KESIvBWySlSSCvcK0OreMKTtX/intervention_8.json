She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The situation involves setting up a date for a friend, Luke, with a girl who was very short. The prom date's friend was also short and turned out to be rude, making fun of Luke's height. The author's date also joined in. The group went to a Chinese restaurant where the friend called it \"Chink food,\" leading the author to feel embarrassed.\n\nAfter a long time of the girls being mean, the author and Luke decided to ditch them at the school parking lot, refusing to take them to the dance. The author feels guilty now and is asking if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girls were being disrespectful, especially targeting Luke's height and the restaurant. The author felt it was unacceptable and stepped in to protect Luke. The cleaning lady had arranged this, but the daughter and her friend were trashy. The author's actions were to stop the bullying and protect their friend.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, standing up against bullying is generally seen as right. The author didn't confront the girls but removed themselves and Luke from the situation, which might be a justified self-defense against harassment. However, ditching someone at a prom is a big deal. Prom dates are important, and leaving them stranded could be seen as a breach of trust or etiquette. But given the context of harassment and the friend's emotional state, the author's intention was to stop further harm.\n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging the daughters' behavior. So, the author might have had valid reasons. The key here is whether the action was a reasonable response to the unacceptable behavior. If the girls were actively making Luke miserable, the author's choice to cut the date short could be seen as protecting their friend and themselves from further humiliation.\n\nIn similar situations, people often debate whether standing up for oneself and others is more important than following social norms. Here, the author's actions were in response to harassment, which could justify their actions. However, there's a line between self-respect and ditching someone. The fact that the author felt bad about it after shows they considered the consequences, but given the circumstances, their primary intent was to stop the bullying.\n\nSo, weighing the options, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author acted to prevent further harassment and protect a friend from being mistreated. The situation involved unacceptable behavior from the dates, and the author made a choice to prioritize their friend's well-being over maintaining the date.\n"
