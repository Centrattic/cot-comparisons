She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about the author ditching their prom date because the date and her friend were being really mean to the author's friend, Luke. The key points here are the actions taken by the author and the context leading up to them.\n\nFirst, the author set up the dates as a favor to the cleaning lady, who asked them to take her daughter to prom and also help the daughter's friend find a date. The friend was short, so they found Luke, who's also short. The problem started when the dates were rude to Luke, making fun of his height and even using a racial slur at the restaurant. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch the girls to protect him.\n\nNow, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for ditching the prom dates? Let's break it down. The author's actions were in response to the girls' unacceptable behavior. The girls were being hostile and disrespectful, which caused Luke emotional distress. The author and Luke decided to leave the girls at the school parking lot, which is a drastic action but done to stop the harassment.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author was trying to stand up for someone being bullied. However, ditching someone, even in response to their bad behavior, can be seen as a breach of trust. The author had a responsibility to their date by showing up, but the context of the situation\u2014harassment and bullying\u2014might mitigate that responsibility. \n\nThe cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging her daughter's behavior. This suggests that the author had valid reasons. The author's intention was to protect Luke, which is a kind act. The method, though, was confrontational and left the girls in an awkward situation. However, given the girls' actions, the author might feel justified.\n\nStill, in social norms, ditching someone even if they're being mean can be seen as harsh. But the alternative was allowing the harassment to continue, which is worse. The author had to make a choice between upholding their end of the date or protecting a friend from emotional harm. Protecting a friend's well-being in that moment could be seen as the right choice, even if the means were abrupt.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The girls' behavior was inexcusable, and the author took action to stop it. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
