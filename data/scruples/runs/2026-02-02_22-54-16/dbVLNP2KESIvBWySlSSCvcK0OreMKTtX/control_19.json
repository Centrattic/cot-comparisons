She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is the asshole (AITA) for ditching their prom date. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the scenario: The author agreed to take the cleaning lady's daughter to prom, and also arranged for his friend Luke to take the daughter's friend. The problem arises when the dates (both the daughter and her friend) are disrespectful towards Luke. The author and Luke then decide to ditch them at the school parking lot after the dinner, leaving the girls to go to the prom on their own. \n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The author set up a double date. The cleaning lady asked the author to take her daughter and also to find a date for her daughter's short friend. The author found Luke for the friend. So, the author is acting as a mediator here.\n\n2. The girls were rude to Luke during dinner. The friend (Luke's date) made a derogatory comment about the food, called it \"Chink food,\" and the daughter's friend continued to mock Luke's height. The author felt bad for Luke, who was a good kid but being targeted.\n\n3. The author and Luke decided to leave the girls at the school parking lot, refusing to take them to the dance. They stood by their decision despite the girls' anger.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional perspective, ditching someone on a date is often seen as inconsiderate. However, the context here is different. The girls were being cruel to Luke, and the author felt responsible for his friend. \n\nPossible arguments for the author being wrong (A): \n- Breaking a promise by ditching the date. Even if the girls were rude, the author had a commitment to take them. \n- The author may have overstepped by making a unilateral decision without consulting the cleaning lady or the girls again. \n- The action could be seen as harsh and possibly illegal if the girls were left in a dangerous situation. \n\nPossible arguments for the author not being wrong (B): \n- The girls' behavior was unacceptable. The author protected a friend from bullying. \n- The situation was a setup that the author had no control over, and they acted to stop further harm to Luke. \n- The cleaning lady later apologized, indicating she saw the girls' behavior as problematic. \n\nConsidering ethical and social norms, while ditching someone usually isn't ideal, the context of the girls' behavior might justify the author's actions. The author prioritized their friend's well-being over the commitment to a date that was clearly unpleasant. The cleaning lady's later apology suggests that the author's actions were justified. \n\nHowever, it's still a complex situation. The author could have tried to resolve the issue during dinner instead of leaving abruptly, which might have been a more mature approach. But given the circumstances, ditching the girls was a reaction to their unacceptable behavior. \n\nIn AITA forums, similar situations often result in the person being \"not the asshole\" if there's a valid reason and the other party was at fault. The girls' behavior was inexcusable, so the author acting in defense of their friend might be seen as justified.\n"
