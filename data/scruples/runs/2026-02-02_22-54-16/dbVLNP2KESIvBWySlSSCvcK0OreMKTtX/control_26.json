She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. The story is about someone who was set up to take a girl to prom, and then their friend was set up to take the girl's friend. The problem arises when the dates are rude and make fun of the friend, leading them to dump the girls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The original person (OP) was asked by their mother's cleaning lady to take the daughter to prom. The cleaning lady also wanted OP to find a date for her daughter's friend. OP found a friend, Luke, who was shorter, and the dates were rude about his height. The friend's date was especially mean, calling the restaurant \"Chink food\" and making other derogatory comments. OP and Luke decided to leave the girls at the school parking lot, leading to the fallout.\n\nNow, the main question is whether OP is the asshole. The user wants a judgment based on the situation. Let's break it down. The girls were unkind and disrespectful to Luke, which is not okay. However, OP was set up by the cleaning lady, which might have been a setup to get OP into a bad situation. The girls' behavior was unacceptable, but OP and Luke decided to take matters into their own hands by ditching them. \n\nOn one hand, the girls acted inappropriately, and OP might have been justified in protecting Luke. On the other hand, OP had a commitment to take them to prom, so leaving them mid-event could be seen as a breach of trust. Also, the cleaning lady's daughter and friend might have felt wronged because they were abandoned, even if they were rude. However, the story mentions that the cleaning lady later apologized, indicating she realized her daughter's behavior was bad.\n\nAnother angle is whether OP had the right to make that decision without consulting the girls. The girls might not have agreed to the terms OP and Luke set, so taking them to the school parking lot and leaving them could be considered a violation of their agreement. But considering the level of disrespect shown to Luke, OP might have felt they had no choice to protect their friend.\n\nLegally and socially, there's a difference between standing up for someone and acting out in a confrontation. However, in this case, the action taken was to leave them, which is a form of walking away from a bad situation. OP wasn't physically violent, just left them. The question is whether this action was a reasonable response to the girls' behavior.\n\nAlso, considering that the cleaning lady's daughter and her friend were the ones initiating the abuse, OP's decision could be seen as a justified self-defense or protection for their friend. The fact that the cleaning lady later apologized supports the idea that the girls' behavior was indeed inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while OP might have felt justified in their actions due to the girls' behavior, the act of ditching the dates could still be seen as breaking a social contract. However, given the context of the girls' disrespectful behavior and the cleaning lady's later apology, OP's actions might be viewed as a necessary response to protect their friend. So, the answer would be that OP is not the asshole (B).\n"
