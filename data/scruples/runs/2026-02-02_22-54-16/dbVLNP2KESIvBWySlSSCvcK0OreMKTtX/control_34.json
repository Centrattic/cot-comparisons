She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the main situation: The author was asked by their mother's cleaning lady to be a prom date for the cleaning lady's daughter. The catch was that the daughter's friend also needed a date, and the friend is very short. The author recruited their friend Luke, who's shorter, and his date. But during the dinner, Luke's date made a lot of rude comments about his height, and the author's date joined in. The food comment about \"Chink food\" also adds to the insult. The author and Luke decided to ditch the girls at the school parking lot, leading to the girls being upset.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's actions were in response to the girls' behavior. The girls were being mean to Luke, which he didn't deserve. The author felt bad for him and took action to stop the harassment. But was ditching them the right move?\n\nOn one hand, the author did set up this arrangement with the cleaning lady, so they might have a responsibility to see it through. By leaving the girls stranded, the author might be seen as breaking a commitment. However, the girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author's friend was being targeted, and they had the right to stand up for him. The decision to leave was made to stop the bullying, which could be seen as justified.\n\nBut there's a question of whether they should have handled it differently. Maybe confronting the girls first, or trying to resolve the situation before leaving. However, given the escalating behavior, the author might have felt it was the only way to protect their friend. The cleaning lady did later apologize, indicating that she recognized the daughters' behavior as wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were a reaction to the girls' misconduct. They might not be in the wrong for standing up for their friend and refusing to tolerate harassment. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
