She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves ditching their prom date and a friend's date after they were rude and abusive. \n\nFirst, the setup: the author's mom's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, with the caveat that the daughter's friend also needed a date. The author arranged for his friend Luke to go with the friend. The key points here are that the girls were unkind, made fun of Luke's height, and were generally disrespectful. The author and Luke decided to ditch them after the dinner.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the actions. The girls' behavior was clearly inappropriate\u2014mocking Luke's height, using a racial slur (\"Chink food\"), and being overall hostile. The author felt responsible for Luke's embarrassment and decided to take action to stop the abuse. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, defending someone being mistreated is a valid action. The author and Luke stood up for themselves and their friend, which is understandable. The cleaning lady later apologized, acknowledging the girls' behavior. This suggests that the author was in the right to act as he did. \n\nHowever, there's a potential issue with abandoning the dates. Legally, if someone is in danger, you might have a duty to help, but in this case, the girls were not in immediate danger. The author didn't leave them stranded; they were dropped off at the school. Ethically, while ditching is usually frowned upon, the context of the girls' behavior changes the perspective. The author's actions were a response to harassment, which can be seen as justified self-defense and protection of a friend.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author did leave them without a prom date, but the girls had already chosen to act disrespectfully. The author wasn't obligated to tolerate that treatment. The cleaning lady knew the girls could be \"trascy,\" so the author might have been aware of possible issues. Still, the decision to ditch them was a reaction to the specific incident, not just preconceived notions.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions were a response to the girls' unacceptable behavior, and the cleaning lady's subsequent apology supports that. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
