She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is the asshole for ditching their prom date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author was asked by the cleaning lady to take her daughter to prom because the daughter's ex-boyfriend was a bad influence. The cleaning lady also wanted the author to take the daughter's friend, who's really short. The author asked their friend Luke, who's shorter and from a wealthy family, to be the date for the friend. Luke agreed.\n\nAt the prom dinner, Luke's date was being very rude, making fun of him for his height. The author's date also joined in. The menu incident where the friend called the restaurant \"Chink food\" adds to the tension. The author felt bad for Luke and decided to ditch the girls after an hour and a half, taking them back to school and leaving them there.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The author set up this situation with the knowledge of the girls' backgrounds. The cleaning lady's daughter was already in a bad situation, and the friend had a problematic attitude. The author tried to help by getting Luke to be a date, but things went south. The girls' behavior was unacceptable, leading the author to take action.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were in response to the girls' behavior. They felt responsible for Luke's well-being and decided to protect him by removing the girls. However, ditching someone, even if they were acting poorly, is a bold move. But given that the girls were being cruel and the author was trying to prevent further harm to Luke, it could be seen as justified.\n\nBut there's a catch. By setting up the date in the first place, the author might have known the friend was short and the daughter was in a bad relationship. Maybe they didn't fully consider that the friend had a history of being a jerk. However, the author did what they thought was right to help their friend and stop the bullying. The cleaning lady even apologized later, which suggests that the author's actions were seen as reasonable.\n\nIn terms of responsibilities, the author might have a duty to their friend Luke to protect him from harassment. The girls' behavior was clearly crossing the line, so the author's decision to end the date could be a form of standing up against bullying. On the other hand, the author did set up the date without knowing the full extent of the girls' personalities, but they had some prior information about the daughter's ex being problematic.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions seem like a last resort to prevent Luke from being further humiliated. They took responsibility, communicated with the cleaning lady, and the cleaning lady acknowledged the daughter's behavior. So, the author isn't entirely to blame here. The main issue was the girls' behavior, and the author acted to stop the harm. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
