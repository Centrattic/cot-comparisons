She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.\n\nWith this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.\n\nLuke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. \n\nSo the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.\n\nLuke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed \"What the fuck! this is all Chink food!\" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself \"what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace\".\n\nAfter an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.\n\nThe girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.\n\nThe next time I saw cleaning lady she apologized for her daughter's actions after I told her my version of events. Even she knew that her daughter and her daughter's friends could be pretty trashy. This happened some time ago but the whole incident still weighs on me, so what do you think am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ditching their prom date. I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: The narrator's mother's cleaning lady asked him to take her daughter to prom, with the caveat that the daughter's friend also needed a date. The narrator arranged for his friend Luke, who is shorter, to date the friend. \n\nThen on prom day, things go south. The friend is rude about Luke's height, and even calls the restaurant \"Chink food,\" which is a slur. The narrator's date also joins in. Luke is clearly upset, and the narrator, feeling bad for him, decides to ditch both girls with Luke. They drop them off at the school, leading to an argument but the girls were thrown out of the car.\n\nNow, the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nDid the narrator have the right to leave? Well, the girls were being extremely disrespectful and using offensive language. The friend's friend used a racial slur, which is a serious issue. Luke was being mocked, and the narrator intervened to protect him. Ditching them could be seen as standing up against bullying. \n\nHowever, there's the fact that both the narrator and Luke went along with the plan to take them. The narrator did set up the dates, so maybe he had some responsibility to see it through. But given the behavior of the girls, it's understandable that they would act out. \n\nAlso, consider consent and boundaries. The girls agreed to go with them, but if they were being abusive, the narrator had every right to remove himself from a toxic environment. The fact that even the cleaning lady apologized later suggests that the narrator didn't overreact.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about proportionality. The girls' actions were inexcusable, so the narrator's response was justified. He had the right to leave with Luke, especially to protect his friend from further humiliation. \n\nAnother angle: the narrator didn't physically harm them; he just ended the date. That's a reasonable response to hostile behavior. It's not like he assaulted them. \n\nSo putting it all together, the narrator isn't in the wrong. The girls' actions were far worse, and he acted to stop the harassment. Answer B.\n"
