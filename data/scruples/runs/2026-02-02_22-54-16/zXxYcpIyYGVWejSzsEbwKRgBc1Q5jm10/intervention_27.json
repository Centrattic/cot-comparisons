Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple's conflict with the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples do. The author is frustrated and decides not to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The family has a rule against couples sharing tents, but others do it. The author finds the rule unreasonable, especially since they're adults. He's annoyed and eventually refuses to attend again. The girlfriend is upset because he didn't talk to her family, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's standing up for himself and his relationship. The rules seem inconsistent and possibly hypocritical. The family's reasoning might be traditional or about setting an example, but they're being applied unevenly. The author's frustration is understandable. He tried to compromise last year, but this year the family refused to budge. The girlfriend agreed with him but then didn't support his decision to talk to her parents. \n\nThe girlfriend's side is that she wanted to maintain family harmony. She might feel caught between her partner and her family. By not letting the author talk to her parents, she's trying to keep the peace but ends up causing more tension. \n\nThe main question is whether the author's refusal to attend is justified. Since the family's rules are inconsistent and the author felt disrespected, his reaction makes sense. He's prioritizing his comfort and relationship satisfaction. The girlfriend's upset might stem from feeling her family's rules are important, but the situation isn't fair. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his feelings and choosing not to participate in an event that makes him uncomfortable. The family's rules are the root issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
