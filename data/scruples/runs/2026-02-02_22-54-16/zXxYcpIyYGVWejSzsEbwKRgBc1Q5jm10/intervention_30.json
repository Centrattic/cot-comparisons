Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples are allowed to. The author is frustrated and ends up not going because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's family has this annual event. Last year, they weren't allowed to share a tent, which the author found silly since they're both 26 and have been dating for a year. The family said it was to avoid a bad example for the kids. Then, this year, other younger couples arrived and shared tents without any issue. The author is upset because they're the only ones separated, even though they've been together longer. The girlfriend agreed with him and promised next year they'd share. But then the next year, the family changed their mind again, leading the author to decide not to go, which upset the girlfriend.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling singled out and not respected. The girlfriend's family is applying a rule inconsistently. The author's frustration builds over time, especially when others aren't held to the same standard. The girlfriend initially supports him but later insists he attend and even gets angry when he refuses.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the family campout, the author has a right to be upset. The family's rules aren't being followed consistently, which makes the author feel targeted. The girlfriend's family's reasoning might be based on their values, but if they enforce it only on one couple, it's unfair. The author isn't wrong for wanting to share a tent, especially in their age and relationship status. The girlfriend's family's actions seem judgmental and not considering the couple's autonomy.\n\nThe author's decision to not attend the campout is a personal choice based on his discomfort and the family's unfair treatment. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling her family's traditions are being challenged, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. He's standing up for his feelings and the fairness of the situation. \n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. The author tried to talk to his girlfriend and even offered to discuss it with her parents, but she refused. This lack of support from her side might have contributed to his decision. The author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his needs and boundaries, especially when the family's rules are inconsistently applied. The family's insistence on the rule without flexibility is the real issue here.\n"
