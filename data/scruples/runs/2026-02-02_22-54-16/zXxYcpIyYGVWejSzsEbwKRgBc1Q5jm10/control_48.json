Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family camping trip where the girlfriend's family won't let the couple share a tent, even though other couples do. The author is upset and decides not to go, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The family's stance is that they don't want the couple (and others) to share a tent, maybe due to conservative views or wanting to set an example for kids. But the author feels it's hypocritical because younger couples are allowed to share tents. He's frustrated and feels singled out, leading him to not attend the next year's event without talking to the family first.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not attending? Well, relationships involve compromise. The author had agreed to not share a tent last year, but this year he's refusing to attend because they're doing the same thing. His girlfriend tried to negotiate, but the family still wouldn't allow it. He's prioritizing his comfort over attending the family event. \n\nOn one hand, he has a right to feel respected and not treated differently. On the other, maybe he should have tried to work it out more gracefully. But given that other couples were allowed to share tents, and the family's rules seem inconsistent, the author's frustration is understandable. His girlfriend's family's rules are causing tension, and he's making a stand by choosing not to participate until his needs are met. \n\nIs refusing to attend the wrong move? It depends on the relationship dynamics. If the girlfriend is upset because he didn't talk to her parents first, maybe he should have done that. But the girlfriend agreed last year that they should share a tent next year. When that didn't happen, he felt justified in his decision. The girlfriend's anger might be because she wanted him to go, even if the situation was uncomfortable. \n\nBut the key points are the inconsistency in the family's rules (other couples sharing tents) and the author's reasonable discomfort in sleeping separately when others don't. The fact that the family didn't change their stance despite prior agreement adds to the conflict. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary if the family isn't respecting their relationship. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
