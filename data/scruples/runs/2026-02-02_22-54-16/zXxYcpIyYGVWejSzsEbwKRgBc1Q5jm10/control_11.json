Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about not being allowed to share a tent with his girlfriend at a family campout, while other couples are allowed. The user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for being upset about this and deciding not to go.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The author and his girlfriend are both 26 and have been dating for a year. Last year, her family didn't let them share a tent, which annoyed him, but he went along with it. Then, this year, other younger couples arrived and shared tents without any issue. The author was upset that they were the only ones not allowed to share, especially since they've been together longer. He told his girlfriend it ruined the trip for him and said he wouldn't come next year if they couldn't share a tent. The girlfriend agreed with him. The next year, after the author tried to get her to talk to her parents, they were told they still couldn't share. The author then refuses to go, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. **Respect for Family Decisions**: The author's girlfriend's family made a rule, possibly out of concern for modesty or setting an example for kids. The author might feel this is unfair, especially since other couples are allowed. However, the family might have their reasons, even if they seem outdated to the author.\n\n2. **Communication and Compromise**: The author tried to talk to the parents himself but the girlfriend refused. He felt it was important enough to not attend the campout. Is that a reasonable response? Maybe he should have tried to find a compromise, but his frustration seems valid given the inconsistency with other couples.\n\n3. **Impact on Relationship**: The girlfriend is upset because he's not going. The author's refusal affects family relationships. But if the family isn't willing to budge, maybe the author is justified in protecting his comfort.\n\n4. **Cultural or Family Norms**: Some families have strict rules about dating couples. The author might not have considered that the family's stance is part of their values, even if it's inconvenient.\n\n5. **His Feelings vs. Their Family's Rules**: The author's feelings of being treated differently are valid. However, in a family event, the family might expect their rules to be followed. The author's decision to not attend could be seen as a way to assert his own values, but it might also be seen as disrespecting his girlfriend's family.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because his feelings are understandable. However, maybe he could have approached it differently, like setting boundaries or discussing it more with his girlfriend to find a middle ground. The family's rules might be non-negotiable, leading to a conflict between his personal comfort and respecting her family. Since the family is being inconsistent (other couples allowed), the author's frustration is justified. But his refusal to attend might be seen as overreacting if he didn't try to resolve it another way. Still, considering the circumstances, it's more about the family's inflexibility than his wrongdoing. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
