Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples are allowed.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend's family thinks it's inappropriate for them to share a tent, even though they're both 26 and have been dating a year. The author is annoyed because they have to sleep separately, but other younger couples are allowed to share. The next year, after agreeing they'd share a tent, the family again forces separation. The author then refuses to attend, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel upset. The family's double standard\u2014letting other couples share but not them\u2014could be seen as hypocritical. The author's discomfort is valid, especially since they're in a committed relationship. The fact that other couples, some less established, are allowed to share tents might make the situation feel unfair. The author's threat to not attend could be a reasonable boundary, given the repeated disrespect from the family.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family has their own rules, possibly based on cultural or family values. The author might be overstepping by not respecting those boundaries. The girlfriend seems to agree with the author, but maybe she's trying to maintain family harmony. The author's ultimatum might have been too harsh if the girlfriend is trying to navigate the situation delicately. \n\nBut considering the repeated issue over two years and the family's inconsistency, the author's frustration is justified. The key point is the family's double standard. If other couples are allowed, it's unfair to single out the author and his girlfriend. The author isn't wrong to feel personally insulted. The girlfriend's family's rules seem arbitrary and disrespectful, so the author isn't in the wrong for pushing back. \n\nAlso, the author tried to compromise by going along the first year and then discussing the issue. The fact that the family changed their stance again without valid reason adds to the problem. The author's decision to not attend is a result of respecting his own boundaries, which is reasonable. The girlfriend being upset might be more about her not wanting to clash with her family, but the author's actions are justified given the circumstances.\n"
