Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other younger couples are doing it. The author is upset and decides not to go, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend's family is treating them differently compared to other couples. They were told last year they could share next year, but this year they're still separated. The author feels this is unfair, especially since others aren't being controlled. He refuses to attend, causing his girlfriend to be upset.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms. Some families have conservative views on when couples can share a tent. Maybe the author's girlfriend's family has specific values they want to uphold, especially around kids. But the author and his girlfriend are both adults, so the family's rules might be overstepping. However, the family might have their reasons for consistency or to set an example.\n\nThe author's reaction: He's frustrated, which is understandable. He tried to compromise by going along last year. This year, after the family didn't follow through on their promise, he decides not to attend. That's a valid choice. He's standing up for himself and his boundaries. But by not attending, he's causing conflict with his girlfriend, who wanted him to go. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not violating any laws or ethical standards. He communicated his feelings, and when his needs weren't met, he chose not to attend. However, the way he handled it\u2014refusing to talk to her parents and causing her to be upset\u2014might be seen as a conflict in the relationship. \n\nBut the root issue is the family's inconsistency and the author's right to be treated equally. The girlfriend's family's rules are problematic here. The author isn't wrong for standing up for his boundaries. The girlfriend might feel caught between her family and her partner's needs, but the author isn't the asshole here. He's reacting to an unfair situation. So the answer is B, No.\n"
