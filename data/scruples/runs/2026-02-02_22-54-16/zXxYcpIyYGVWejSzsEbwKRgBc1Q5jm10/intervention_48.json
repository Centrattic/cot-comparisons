Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples who are younger and have been together less time do share tents. The author is frustrated and decides to not go because of it, but the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the family's rule about tent-sharing. The author and his girlfriend are both 26 and have been dating a year, which is a mature age and a significant relationship duration. The family's objection seems to be about setting a bad example for the kids, but other couples are allowed to do it. The author tried to accept it last year but felt it was unfair this year when others were allowed to share. He communicated his feelings, and the girlfriend initially agreed but then her family changed their stance again, leading him to refuse to attend and causing conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to consider whether that's the case. From a fairness perspective, the family's rule seems inconsistent. If the concern is about setting an example, but others are allowed to share, it's arbitrary. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the author's response might be seen as overreacting by threatening not to go, which could affect the girlfriend's relationship with her family. But the girlfriend agreed with him last year, and this time she's upset when he refuses to go. The author's actions are based on personal boundaries and feeling disrespected. The family's insistence without a clear, consistent reason might be the issue. The author isn't the one enforcing the rule, and the girlfriend's family's behavior could be the problem here. So, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
