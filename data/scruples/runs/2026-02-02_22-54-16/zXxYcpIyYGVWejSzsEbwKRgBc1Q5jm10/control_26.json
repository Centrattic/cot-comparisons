Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples do. The author is upset and decides not to go, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend's family has this annual campout. Last year, they weren't allowed to share a tent, which the author found annoying. This year, other couples arrived and shared tents without any issue. The author felt singled out and was upset. He tried to talk to the girlfriend's parents but she didn't let him. Now he's refusing to go, and the girlfriend is upset with him.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the author's reasoning: He's an adult, 26, in a one-year relationship. The family's rule seems inconsistent since other couples are allowed to share. The author felt respected by the family's rule was not being applied fairly. He expressed his feelings to his girlfriend, who initially agreed to fix it but then the family decided against it. The author then decided not to attend, which led to conflict.\n\nPossible angles: Is the author overreacting? Are the family's rules reasonable? The author's right to express his feelings and set boundaries? \n\nThe family's stance might be based on their values, but their application is inconsistent. The author isn't demanding a tent, just equal treatment. His frustration is valid because of the double standard. However, refusing to attend might be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's wishes, especially if she wanted him to go. But the author's justification is that he feels disrespected and the situation is unfair.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend might be caught between her family and her partner. The author isn't wrong for wanting to share a tent, especially with other couples doing it. His decision to not attend is a choice based on his comfort and the unfair treatment. However, the girlfriend's upset could imply that he didn't handle it well, but the situation is complex.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's inconsistent rules and his right to express his discomfort make his stance reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
