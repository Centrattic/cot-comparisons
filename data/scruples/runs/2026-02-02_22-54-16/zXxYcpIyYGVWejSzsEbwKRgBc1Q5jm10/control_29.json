Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent during a family campout, even though other couples who are younger and have been together less are allowed to. The author is upset about this and decided not to go this year, which made his girlfriend angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The family's reasoning was that it's inappropriate and sets a bad example for the kids. They're probably trying to maintain some family values or traditions. On the other hand, the author and his girlfriend are both adults, have been dating for over a year, and the author feels it's unfair that other couples aren't restricted the same way. He's frustrated that his privacy is being invaded and that the family isn't applying the rule consistently.\n\nThe author's decision to not attend the campout is a response to what he perceives as unfair treatment. He communicated his feelings to his girlfriend, who initially agreed that next year they'd share a tent. But when the family reversed the decision again, he refused to go. The girlfriend is upset because he's not attending, but maybe she's caught between her family's expectations and her partner's feelings.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, he's an adult, so sharing a tent might be uncomfortable. The inconsistency in the family's rules could be an issue. However, he's choosing not to attend a family event, which could strain his relationship with the girlfriend and her family. But his girlfriend did say it was okay to talk to her parents, but she stopped him. Maybe the conflict here is more about the family's rules being unreasonable rather than the author's reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author could have found a compromise, like setting boundaries without skipping the event. But given the history of the family not respecting their agreement from the previous year, his frustration is understandable. The key point is whether his reaction is disproportionate. Since the family is applying the rule inconsistently and the author's privacy is being invaded, maybe he's justified in his stance. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the family's rules are inconsistent and the author's feelings are valid. However, maybe there's a middle ground. But based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
