Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a family camping trip where the girlfriend's family didn't let them share a tent, but allowed other younger couples to do so. The author felt this was unfair and decided not to go, which upset his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The family's rule seems inconsistent\u2014applying to the author and his girlfriend but not others. The girlfriend initially promised they could share a tent next year, but after discussing, they were told again to be separate. The author is frustrated and refuses to attend, leading the girlfriend to be upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. So, I should consider both sides. The family's stance might be rooted in their values or traditions, maybe trying to protect their daughter or set an example. The author's reaction is about feeling insulted and the inconsistency. But is it fair for him to walk away because of that? \n\nIs the author being unreasonable by not attending the campout? If the family is insistent, maybe the author should respect their wishes to maintain family harmony. On the other hand, the family's rule is hypocritical, and the author has valid feelings of being treated differently. \n\nThe girlfriend's role is also important. She agreed with the author's frustration but still wanted him to go. Maybe she's trying to keep things peaceful. However, the author's refusal might be seen as prioritizing his comfort over her family's needs, which could be a point of conflict.\n\nSo, the author isn't clearly in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. The family's inconsistency and the author's valid feelings of being singled out as factors. But the decision to not attend could also strain the relationship. It's a matter of perspective on whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances. The answer might be B, but I need to check if there's any obvious wrong.\n"
