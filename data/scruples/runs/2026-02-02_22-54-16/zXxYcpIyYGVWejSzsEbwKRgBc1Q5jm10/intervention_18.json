Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about sharing a tent at a family campout. The girlfriend's family\u4e0d\u8ba9 them share a tent, even though other couples are allowed to. The author is upset about being treated differently.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They're 26 and in a committed relationship for a year. They tried to go along with the family's rules last year, but this year, when other couples (who are younger and less established) are allowed to share tents, they feel it's unfair. The girlfriend's family then again enforces the separation, leading the author to refuse to go. The girlfriend is upset with the author for not attending and for wanting to confront her parents.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, respect, and fairness. The author is frustrated by being treated differently, which seems unjust. They communicated their feelings to the girlfriend, who agreed last time. But this year, her parents changed the rules again. The author's refusal is a response to feeling disrespected. However, the girlfriend is upset because he's not attending and not following her lead.\n\nNow, considering relationships dynamics. The author has a right to feel respected in their relationship. The family's double standard is unfair. But the author's decision to not attend might be seen as a conflict with the girlfriend's wishes. However, the girlfriend did agree in the past but now her family changed their mind without consulting properly. The author's frustration is valid, but maybe their reaction could be considered inconsiderate to their girlfriend's position. However, if the family is being unreasonable, the author isn't entirely at fault.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's family's rules might be based on their own values, but applying them selectively is hypocritical. The author isn't wrong for finding this unfair. However, choosing not to attend the campout might have hurt the girlfriend's feelings, but that's part of the conflict. It's a balance between respecting the girlfriend's family and the author's needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves. The family's inconsistent rules are problematic. The girlfriend's refusal to let the author talk to her parents might have contributed to the conflict. So, the author's no-show is a reaction to ongoing disrespect, which isn't their fault.\n"
