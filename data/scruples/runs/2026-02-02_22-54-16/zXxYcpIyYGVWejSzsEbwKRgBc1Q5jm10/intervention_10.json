Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples are allowed. The author is upset about being treated differently and decides not to go this year, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The girlfriend's family has specific rules about tent-sharing, possibly due to cultural or family values. The author and girlfriend are in a committed relationship, older than some couples present, and have been together longer. The family's decision feels discriminatory to the author, especially since other couples, some less established, are allowed to share tents without issue. \n\nThe author tried to handle it by discussing with his girlfriend, who initially agreed to push for a tent next year. But when it didn't happen, he decided not to attend, which upset his girlfriend. The question is whether he's in the wrong for prioritizing his comfort over attending the family event.\n\nFrom a perspective of personal boundaries and respect, the author has a right to feel his privacy and relationship autonomy are being respected. The family's rules might be well-intentioned but they're treating him differently, which can be seen as disrespectful. However, the girlfriend might value family harmony more, leading to conflict between the couple's priorities.\n\nThe key points are the family's inconsistency in applying rules, the author's valid frustration over being singled out, and the girlfriend's insistence on attending despite his objections. The author's decision not to go could be seen as standing up for himself, but it's causing strain in the relationship. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't clearly in the wrong. The family's rules are problematic, and the girlfriend's family's approach might need to be addressed. However, the author's refusal to attend could also be seen as a personal choice that affects the girlfriend's relationship with her family. But since the family's actions are the root cause, the author's stance is justifiable. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
