Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend's family wouldn't let them share a tent at a family campout. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and his girlfriend are both 26, been dating a year. Her family has a campout every year. Last year, they weren't allowed to share a tent because the family thought it would set a bad example for the kids. The author found this annoying but went along with it, trusting that next year they'd be allowed. Then, when they arrived, other younger couples (friends of her cousins) shared tents without any issue. This made the author really angry because they were the only couple not allowed to share, despite being a more established relationship. He expressed his frustration, and his girlfriend agreed, saying next year they'd share a tent.\n\nThis year, the author tried to get the girlfriend to talk to her parents about sharing a tent again. She didn't want him to talk to them himself, which he did anyway. The parents said they needed to consult other adults, then came back saying they had to be separate again. The author refused to go, leading to conflict with his girlfriend who was upset he wouldn't attend.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the perspectives. The family's stance might be based on their values, thinking it's inappropriate for unmarried couples to share a tent, especially around kids. They might be trying to maintain certain family traditions or moral standards. However, the author and girlfriend are adults, in a committed relationship, and the situation seems inconsistent when other couples are allowed to share. The author's frustration is understandable given the inconsistency and the implication that their relationship isn't as accepted as others.\n\nThe girlfriend's side: She might be trying to maintain family harmony and respect her parents' wishes. She agreed with the author's frustration but perhaps didn't want to openly challenge her family. Her insistence that he attend despite the situation could be about keeping peace. The author's refusal might be seen as a stand for their relationship's respect, but it also creates tension with her family.\n\nIs the author wrong for not going? If he's prioritizing his feelings and the fairness of the situation over attending the campout, it's about personal boundaries. However, if the girlfriend is genuinely hurt by his refusal, that's a conflict. But the family's rules being inconsistent and hypocritical might justify his stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be overreacting to a family tradition, even if it's unfair. Maybe the campout is important to the girlfriend, and his refusal is harming the relationship. But given the inconsistency, maybe he's right to feel disrespected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction is reasonable. Since the family's rules are inconsistently applied and they are adults, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
