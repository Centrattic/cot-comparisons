Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other younger couples can. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair and it's ruining his experience. The girlfriend's family says it's inappropriate, but others are allowed to share tents. The author refuses to go next year unless they can share a tent, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's side: he's an adult, in a committed relationship, and feels that the family's rules are unfair, especially when younger couples aren't restricted. He's frustrated that he's being treated differently. The girlfriend's family's perspective might be that they have family values or guidelines, maybe to avoid setting a bad example for kids or maintaining certain family traditions. The girlfriend seems to support the author's feelings but isn't pushing hard enough to change her family's stance, which leads to conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to comply? Well, he's within his rights to be upset if he feels discriminated against. But maybe he should have communicated better or found another way to handle it. However, the family's rules are their choice, but they might not consider the couple's autonomy. The key point is whether the author overreacted. He did explain his feelings and tried to compromise. The family didn't budge, so his refusal might be justified. The girlfriend is upset because he's not attending, but maybe she should have advocated more for their relationship's needs. \n\nThe question is if the author is the asshole. From the info given, the family's rules are arbitrary and inconsistent. The author isn't doing anything wrong by standing up for his comfort and relationship. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
