Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a couple's conflict over sharing a tent at a family campout. The girlfriend's family has a rule against the couple sharing a tent, but other couples, even younger ones, are allowed to. The author feels this is unfair and is upset, leading to a conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main grievance is about being treated differently compared to other couples. The family's stance seems inconsistent because they allow other couples to share tents but not the author and his girlfriend. The author's frustration is understandable given the inconsistency. \n\nThe girlfriend initially agrees that this is a problem and promises that next year they can share a tent. However, her family reverses the decision again the next year, leading the author to refuse attending. The girlfriend is upset because he's not attending, but the author feels wronged by the family's double standard.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is the author in the wrong? The author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by expressing his feelings and making a choice about attending an event. The family's rule is the root issue here, and the inconsistency makes it seem like the rule is targeted at the author and his girlfriend. The author isn't being unreasonable in his request to share a tent, especially since others are allowed to. Refusing to attend because of being treated unfairly isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is also important. She might feel that the family's decision isn't just about them and that the author is prioritizing his feelings over her family time. But given the inconsistency in the rules, the author's frustration is justified. The girlfriend agreed with him initially but then the family changed their mind, which adds to the author's justification for feeling upset. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's unfair treatment and the girlfriend's change in stance after initial agreement contribute to the author's valid feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
