Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author and his girlfriend not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples are allowed. The author is frustrated because he feels it's unfair, especially since they've been together longer than some of the other couples there. His girlfriend agrees with him but her family still insists on keeping them separate. The author then decides not to go to the next campout, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he's an adult, in a committed relationship, and being treated differently than others. It's understandable that sharing a tent is important for privacy and intimacy. The fact that other couples are allowed to do it makes him feel singled out, which adds to his frustration. His girlfriend initially agrees that next time they'll share a tent, but then her family changes their mind, leading him to refuse to attend. Is that reasonable?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, maybe based on cultural norms, family traditions, or just personal beliefs. They might not see it as targeting the author specifically but as a general rule for all couples. However, the inconsistency in enforcement (other couples are allowed) does make it seem hypocritical. The author's decision to not attend is a reaction to feeling disrespected. Is that overreacting?\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because the author isn't going, which suggests that she values the family event despite the tent issue. She might be trying to maintain family harmony, even if it means compromising her partner's comfort. The author, however, is prioritizing his own needs and the respect he feels he's entitled to. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are the family's rules versus the couple's autonomy. The author isn't at fault for expressing his feelings and setting boundaries. His girlfriend's family isn't in the right for enforcing an inconsistent rule. The girlfriend might be caught between her partner and her family, but that doesn't make the author wrong for standing his ground. The answer likely hinges on whether respecting personal boundaries is more important than attending a family event. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
