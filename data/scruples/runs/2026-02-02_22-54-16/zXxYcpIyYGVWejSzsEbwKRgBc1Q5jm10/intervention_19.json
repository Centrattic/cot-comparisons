Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend not being allowed to share a tent at a family camping trip, while other couples are allowed. The author is frustrated because he feels singled out and that his girlfriend's family is being hypocritical. He decides not to go the next year, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The family's rule seems inconsistent because other couples, some younger and with less time together, are allowed to share tents. The author's main issue is feeling insulted and treated unfairly. He communicated his feelings to his girlfriend, and she agreed that they should be allowed to share a tent. However, the family's decision was made again the next year, leading to conflict.\n\nI should analyze the boundaries and expectations. The author's reaction is based on feeling disrespected. When the family's rules are applied unevenly, it's reasonable for someone to feel upset. Also, the author's decision not to attend is a personal choice based on his discomfort with the situation. The girlfriend's insistence that he go despite his objections might indicate that she values family time over his comfort, which could be a point of contention.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel caught between her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. She agreed with the author's perspective but may have felt pressured to comply with her family's wishes. However, the author's refusal to attend isn't necessarily wrong because he's prioritizing his own well-being and the respect he deserves in the relationship.\n\nIs there a cultural context where family rules are more important? Maybe in some families, traditions are non-negotiable. But in this case, the rule is being applied inconsistently, which complicates things. The author's frustration is justified given the hypocrisy. His right to set boundaries about his comfort in a shared space is valid.\n\nThe girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling that he's rejecting her family, which could be seen as a test of commitment. However, the author's stance is about mutual respect and fair treatment. If the family isn't willing to adjust their rules, it's a legitimate choice to step back from an uncomfortable situation.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions are a response to being treated unfairly. He communicated his feelings, tried to resolve it through his girlfriend, and made a decision based on his comfort. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
