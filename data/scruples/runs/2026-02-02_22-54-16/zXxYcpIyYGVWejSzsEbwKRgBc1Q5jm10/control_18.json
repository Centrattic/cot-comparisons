Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about sharing a tent at a family campout. The girlfriend's family didn't allow the couple to share a tent, even though other couples (who are younger and have been together less time) did. The author is upset because he feels singled out and insulted. The girlfriend agreed with him but her parents still made them sleep separately again. Now he's refusing to go, and the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's being treated unfairly. He's an adult, in a committed relationship, and it's frustrating that other couples aren't held to the same standard. The girlfriend's family's reasoning might be about setting an example for kids, but if other couples are allowed, that seems inconsistent. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014he's trying to respect his girlfriend's family's rules, but when he sees others not following them, it feels hypocritical. \n\nThen there's the part where the girlfriend agreed with him last year but this year the family still refused. The author tried to talk to them but was blocked by his girlfriend. Now he's not going, which upsets her. Is he in the wrong here? Well, he's standing up for his boundaries, but maybe he could have communicated better. However, the main issue is the unfair treatment by the family. The girlfriend's family's inconsistency is a problem, and the author's frustration is valid. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction to him not attending is also important. If she's upset, maybe she feels he's overreacting or not respecting her family's wishes. But the author isn't wrong to feel insulted. The family's rules are arbitrary, and the author is within his rights to set boundaries. So, the answer is probably B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for fair treatment, and the family's inconsistency is the real issue here.\n"
