Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a family campout where the girlfriend's family doesn't allow the author and his girlfriend to share a tent, even though other younger couples do. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair and ultimately decides not to go, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the family's rule about not sharing a tent, which seems inconsistent since other couples aren't reprimanded. The author has been trying to navigate this by agreeing last year, then pushing for a shared tent this year. The girlfriend agrees but her family again enforces separation, leading to the author's decision to not attend. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's an adult in a committed relationship, and being forced to sleep apart from his girlfriend when others aren't might feel discriminatory. His girlfriend's family's reasoning about setting an example for kids is questionable, especially since other couples aren't facing the same rule. The girlfriend's insistence that he attend despite his discomfort adds another layer. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for prioritizing his comfort and standing up for what he believes is fair? Or is he overreacting by refusing to attend? The girlfriend's family's actions might be based on their values, but their enforcement seems inconsistent. The author's decision to not go could be seen as respecting his boundaries, which is valid. However, the girlfriend's upset reaction suggests that he might have hurt her feelings by not going along with her wishes. \n\nBut considering the situation, the author has valid reasons for his stance. The family's double standard and the author's feelings being disregarded could justify his reaction. The girlfriend's refusal to let him talk to her parents might indicate that she's not fully supporting his position, which complicates things. However, the core issue is the unfair treatment, and the author isn't wrong for wanting to address it. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
