Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, even though other younger couples are allowed to. The author is upset because their girlfriend's family is treating them differently, and now they're refusing to attend the next year if they can't share a tent. The girlfriend is upset that the author isn't going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is an adult in a long-term relationship, and the family's rules are affecting their personal choices. The family might have their reasons, like wanting to set an example for kids or maintain a certain atmosphere. But the author feels it's unfair and disrespectful, especially since others are allowed to share tents. \n\nThe girlfriend agreed with the author's feelings last year but didn't stand up to her family this year. The author tried to talk to the family but was blocked by the girlfriend. Now, the author is choosing not to attend, leading to conflict with the girlfriend. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not attending? Well, the author has a right to feel respected in their relationship. If the family's rules are causing personal discomfort and the girlfriend isn't supporting the author's wishes, the author's decision to not participate is understandable. However, maybe the author could have found a compromise, but the situation seems like a breach of personal boundaries. \n\nThe key points are the inconsistency in the family's rules and the author's legitimate frustration. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're asserting their right to privacy and respect in their relationship. The girlfriend's family's rules may be their choice, but they should be applied consistently. The author isn't the asshole here because they're standing up for themselves and their relationship. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
