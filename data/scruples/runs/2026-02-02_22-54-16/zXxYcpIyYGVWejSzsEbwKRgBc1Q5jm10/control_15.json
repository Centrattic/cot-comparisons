Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a couple where the girlfriend's family doesn't allow them to share a tent during a family campout, even though other couples who are younger and have been together less time do share tents. The author is frustrated and decides not to go this year, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author and his girlfriend are both 26, in a one-year relationship. Last year, they were forced to sleep separately, which annoyed him. This year, even though other couples are allowed to share tents, they aren't. He feels this is unfair and decides not to attend the campout unless they can share a tent. His girlfriend is upset because he's not going and he's not talking to her parents about it as he initially wanted.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about personal boundaries, family expectations, and the author's decision to not attend the event. The question is whether he's in the wrong for choosing not to go or for being upset about the unequal treatment.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's frustrated because the family's rules seem inconsistent. They're treating him and his girlfriend differently than other couples, which he finds insulting. His feelings are valid because it's about personal space and privacy in a relationship. He's also trying to communicate his needs to his girlfriend, who is trying to mediate but perhaps isn't successful in getting her family to change their stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own cultural or personal reasons for enforcing this rule. They might believe it's appropriate for younger couples or that it's part of family traditions. However, the inconsistency (other couples being allowed to share tents) suggests that the rule isn't applied uniformly, which could be a point against their reasoning.\n\nThe author's decision to not attend is a personal choice based on his discomfort with the situation. He's not causing harm to others; he's choosing his own comfort and respect. The girlfriend is upset because he's not going, but the author's actions stem from a place of feeling disrespected. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's complicated. The family's rules might be their own to enforce, but if they're inconsistent, that could be problematic. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset about being treated differently than others. His choice to not go is a valid response to being made uncomfortable. The girlfriend might feel caught between her family and her partner's needs, which is tough, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for his own boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's advocating for his own needs and the situation's inconsistency justifies his frustration. He's not violating any rules here; he's choosing not to participate in an event that makes him uncomfortable due to unfair treatment.\n"
