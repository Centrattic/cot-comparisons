Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's family doesn't let the couple share a tent at a family campout. The author is 26, in a one-year relationship, and finds the rule stupid. They agree to not share a tent last year but were upset because other younger couples did. This year, the family again insists on separate tents, leading the author to refuse to go, causing conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nSo, who's right here? The family's stance might be based on their values or trying to set an example for kids. But the author feels it's unfair, especially since other couples aren't treated the same. The girlfriend initially agrees with him but then her family backs out again. The author's refusal to attend seems like a reaction to being treated differently.\n\nIs the author wrong? On one hand, he's standing up for his right to privacy and fairness. On the other, maybe he's overreacting by not going, causing tension in the relationship. But the family's inconsistency (other couples share tents) makes the rule seem hypocritical. The author's frustration is valid. The girlfriend's family's rules might be their choice, but enforcing it selectively is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to comply with what he sees as an unfair policy, especially after being assured it would change. So, answer B (No).\n"
