Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other younger couples do. The author is upset about it and decided not to go this year, which made his girlfriend really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're an adult couple, been dating a year, and the family treated them differently. They felt it was unfair, especially since others were allowed to share tents. The girlfriend agreed with them last year but then the family said no again this year, and the author decided to not attend, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, like being conservative or trying to set an example for kids. But the author points out that other couples, even younger ones, aren't given the same treatment. That inconsistency could be a problem. The author also tried to talk to the family through the girlfriend, but when that failed, they opted out of attending, which upset the girlfriend.\n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing his comfort and standing up for what he feels is fair? Or is he wrong for making a decision that affects the girlfriend's family event? The girlfriend might feel he's being disrespectful to her family's wishes. But the author's frustration is valid due to the double standard. \n\nMaybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's an adult and has the right to feel uncomfortable. However, not attending might be seen as a harsh response. But if the situation is causing him to not enjoy the event, then maybe his reaction is understandable. The girlfriend's family's inconsistency (letting others share tents but not them) is a key point here. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, the girlfriend might have wanted to handle it differently, leading to conflict. But the author's actions aren't inherently wrong; they're expressing their feelings about a situation they find unfair. So, probably, the answer is B (the author isn't in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a cultural or familial context I'm missing. Maybe the family has strict norms they expect guests to follow. However, the double standard weakens that argument. So I think the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
