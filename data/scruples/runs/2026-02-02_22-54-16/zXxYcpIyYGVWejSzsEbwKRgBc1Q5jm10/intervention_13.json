Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong regarding the tent situation at the family campout. \n\nFirst, the context: The author and his girlfriend are both 26 and have been dating for over a year. His girlfriend's family, including her parents and aunts, made them sleep separately last year because they thought it would set a bad example for the kids. The author found this unreasonable but agreed to go along with it because the girlfriend promised they'd share a tent next year. However, this year, other younger couples (friends of her cousins) were allowed to share tents without any issue. When the author raised the inconsistency, his girlfriend agreed with him, but then her parents again refused, leading the author to decide not to attend the campout again. The girlfriend is upset about this decision.\n\nNow, evaluating right and wrong. The key points here are about personal boundaries, respect, and the family's rules. The author's frustration is understandable given the double standard. The family's decision seems rooted in conservative views about cohabitation, even among adults. However, the family has the right to set their own rules for their event. The author is within his rights to feel offended and to set his own boundaries. He communicated his feelings to his girlfriend, who initially agreed, but her parents changed the rules again. The author's refusal to attend is his choice, but it's causing conflict with his girlfriend. \n\nIs he in the wrong? If we consider that he's standing up for his own comfort and relationship boundaries, then no. However, if we consider that he's causing tension by not respecting the family's rules, maybe. But given the inconsistency (other couples are allowed to share), his stance is reasonable. The girlfriend might be caught between her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. The author isn't violating anything by not attending. So, answer B (not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
