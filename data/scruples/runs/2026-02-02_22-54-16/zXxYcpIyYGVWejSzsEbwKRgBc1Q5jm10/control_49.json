Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples do.\n\nFirst, the background: The couple is 26, dating for a year. Last year, they were told not to share a tent because of the kids. The author complied but was annoyed. This year, other younger couples shared tents without issue. The author was upset, felt singled out, and discussed it with his girlfriend. The next year, after agreeing they'd share a tent, the family again forbade it. The author refuses to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nIs the author wrong? Let's consider the key points. The family's rules seem inconsistent. They don't apply to others, which the author finds unfair. The author's feelings of being insulted and the impact on his enjoyment of the event are valid. However, the girlfriend's parents might have their own reasons, perhaps related to their values or the presence of children. The author's response is to refuse to attend, which could be seen as a strong reaction. But if he's communicated his feelings and the girlfriend's family still enforces the rule without compromise, his stance might be justifiable. The girlfriend's insistence that he attend despite his objections might also be a point of contention. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for his comfort and expressing his feelings, especially since the rule doesn't apply to others. However, the way he's handling it (refusing to attend and not talking to the parents as the girlfriend requested) might be seen as inflexible. But given the inconsistency in the family's rules, his reaction is understandable. So, likely not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
