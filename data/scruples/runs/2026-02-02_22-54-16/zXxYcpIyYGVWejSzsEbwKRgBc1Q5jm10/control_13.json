Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend's family not allowing the couple to share a tent at a family campout. The author is upset because other couples are allowed to do so, even though they're younger and have been together less time. He refuses to go this year, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author has a valid grievance. The family's rule seems inconsistent. If other couples are allowed to share tents regardless of their status, while the author and his girlfriend aren't despite their longer relationship, that's a point in his favor. The family's reasoning might be based on outdated or hypocritical standards, which could be frustrating.\n\nThe girlfriend initially agreed with the author's frustration and promised next year they'd share a tent. But when the author tried to address it again, her parents made an exception for others but not for them. That inconsistency could justify the author's anger. However, the author's response was to refuse to attend, which might be seen as a reasonable choice given the circumstances if he feels disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset that he's not going, which shows the situation is causing strain in their relationship. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified given the family's actions. If the family is being unfair, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for himself. But if he's overreacting or not considering the family's perspective, he might be seen as the problem.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling singled out. The family's rule isn't applied consistently, which is a valid point. The girlfriend's refusal to let him talk to her parents might indicate that she's trying to avoid conflict, but she's also prioritizing family over her partner's feelings. However, the author's refusal to attend might be a consequence of feeling disrespected. \n\nIn terms of social norms, families sometimes have rules that might not align with the couple's expectations, but in this case, the inconsistency is a red flag. The author's stance is about personal boundaries and being treated equally. If the family won't change their stance, the author's decision to not attend might be a way to protect his own feelings and set boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's actions are inconsistent, and the author is just responding to how he's being treated. The girlfriend's frustration might be because she wants to maintain family relationships, but the author's position is about his own comfort and respect.\n"
