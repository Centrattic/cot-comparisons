Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent during a family campout, while other couples do. The author feels singled out and frustrated, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend's family has a tradition where couples aren't allowed to share tents. The author and his girlfriend are in a 1-year relationship, both 26, and the family thought it's inappropriate, especially with kids around. The author agreed last year, but was upset because other younger couples this year did share tents. He expressed his frustration, and the girlfriend agreed, promising next year they could share. But this year, the family again said no, and the author refuses to attend unless they can share. The girlfriend is upset because he's not going and doesn't want him to talk to her parents.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at both sides. The family's stance is about their values and setting an example for kids. The author feels it's unfair, especially since others are allowed. He's within his rights to feel upset about being treated differently. However, the girlfriend is caught between her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. The author's refusal to attend could strain the relationship and show disrespect to her family. But the family's rule seems inconsistent (other couples allowed) and their reasoning might be outdated given the couple's age and relationship status. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid, but his response (not attending) might be extreme. The girlfriend's family's decision is their choice, even if it's unfair. The author's refusal to communicate directly with the family (as the girlfriend wouldn't let him) might not help. However, the family's enforcement of the rule without considering the couple's maturity could be the main issue here. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoings, the author isn't violating any rules. The family's actions are their decision, but the author's reaction is a personal choice based on their situation. So, the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong) because the family's rules are subjective, and the author is justified in his feelings.\n"
