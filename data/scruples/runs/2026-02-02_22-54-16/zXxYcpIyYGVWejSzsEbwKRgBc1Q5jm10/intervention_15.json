Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend's family doesn't allow them to share a tent during a family campout, even though other couples (some younger and less established) do share tents. The author is upset because he feels this is unfair and is considering not attending the campout again.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the family's rule about not sharing a tent, which the author finds hypocritical when others do it. The girlfriend initially agrees that next year they'll share, but the family again enforces the rule. The author decides not to go and refuses to talk to her parents, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's justified in feeling wronged because the rule seems inconsistent. The family's reasoning about setting a bad example for kids might be outdated or not applied equally. The girlfriend's family is making a personal decision that affects the couple's experience, and the author is standing up for their relationship dynamic. However, the girlfriend is upset because he's not attending, which might be because she values family time over his preference.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not doing anything overtly wrong. He's expressing his feelings and setting boundaries. The problem lies with the family's rules and the girlfriend's handling of the situation. The author's refusal to attend is a personal choice based on his discomfort with the family's rules. Since the family is enforcing a rule that others aren't held to, the author's stance is reasonable. The girlfriend's frustration stems from his choice to not attend, but that's more about her priorities than his being wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). He's standing up for himself and his relationship's needs, which is valid. The family's inconsistency and the girlfriend's pressure to comply don't make him the asshole here.\n"
