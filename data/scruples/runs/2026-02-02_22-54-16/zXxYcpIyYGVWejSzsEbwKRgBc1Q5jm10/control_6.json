Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples do. The author feels this is unfair, especially since they've been in a long-term relationship and other younger couples aren't restricted. The girlfriend initially supported sharing a tent next year, but after a year, her parents changed their minds again. The author refuses to attend the campout unless they can share a tent, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: they see the family's rule as unfair and insulting. They're frustrated because other couples aren't held to the same standard. The girlfriend's family's double standard is a key point here. The author's refusal to attend is based on respecting their relationship and personal boundaries. They tried to compromise but felt their concerns were not addressed, leading to their decision to withdraw from an event they already find stressful.\n\nThe girlfriend's side: she's upset that the author isn't going because the family's decision is about maintaining family traditions or setting an example for kids. However, the fact that other couples aren't restricted might undermine her family's argument. The author's insistence on sharing a tent is about fairness and respect, not just wanting to sleep with their partner. The girlfriend's refusal to let the author talk to her parents might indicate a lack of support for his concerns.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the family's rules are their choice, but there's a double standard. The author isn't being unreasonable for wanting to share a tent, especially given their relationship status. The girlfriend's family's inconsistency (allowing other couples) does make their stance seem hypocritical. The author's decision to prioritize his comfort and relationship dynamics isn't unreasonable. The girlfriend being upset might be more about not wanting to confront her family or lose the social event, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
