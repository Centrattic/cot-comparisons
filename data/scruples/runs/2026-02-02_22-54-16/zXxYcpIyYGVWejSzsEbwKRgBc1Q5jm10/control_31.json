Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent during a family campout, which the author finds unfair, especially since other younger couples were allowed to. The author is upset, feels insulted, and decides not to go this year, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The family's rule applies only to the author and his girlfriend, despite other couples being allowed to share. The author's frustration is understandable because they were the only ones separated, and they had a longer relationship. The girlfriend initially agreed that next year they could share, but the family changed their mind again. The author then refuses to attend, which upsets the girlfriend.\n\nNow, assessing who is in the wrong. The author's reaction stems from feeling treated unfairly. The family's rules are inconsistent, which is a problem on their side. The author isn't wrong for being upset about being singled out. However, he decides not to go, which affects the girlfriend. She might feel caught between her family and her partner. But the author's action is a result of the family's inconsistency and not respecting their agreement. The girlfriend's family's rules are the root cause here. The author isn't the one enforcing the rule; he's objecting to it. So, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
