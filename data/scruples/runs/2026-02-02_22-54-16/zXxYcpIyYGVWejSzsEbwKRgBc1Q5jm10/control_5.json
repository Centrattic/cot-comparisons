Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples do. The author is frustrated and decides not to attend the next year, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The family's reason is that it's inappropriate and sets a bad example for kids. The author and his girlfriend are 26 and have been dating for over a year. They're being treated differently from other couples at the campout, which is causing the author distress. The girlfriend initially promised the tent would be shared next year, but when the family refused again, the author decided not to attend, leading to the girlfriend being upset.\n\nThe main issue here is about respecting family boundaries versus personal autonomy. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since other couples are allowed to share tents. The family's stance seems inconsistent, which adds to the author's resentment. However, the author's decision to not attend the campout without talking to the family might be seen as overreacting, especially since the girlfriend wanted him to go and he had refused to communicate directly with her parents despite being offered the chance. \n\nBut considering the family's rules and the girlfriend's role in mediating, there's a balance between respecting family traditions and the couple's autonomy. The author's feelings are valid given the inconsistency, but cutting off a family event entirely without resolution might be seen as extreme. However, the girlfriend's refusal to let the author talk to her parents could also be problematic, as it might have been a way to address the issue directly.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset and refusing to attend if the situation isn't resolved. The family's rules are arbitrary, and the author's response is a form of standing up for his comfort. On the other hand, maybe he should have handled it differently, like discussing it with the family first before canceling. But given the context, his actions are a reaction to disrespectful treatment. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
