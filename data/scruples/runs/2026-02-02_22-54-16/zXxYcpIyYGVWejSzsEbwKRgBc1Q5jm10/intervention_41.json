Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout. \n\nFirst, the background: The family campout happens every year. Last year, the author and his girlfriend couldn't share a tent because the family thought it set a bad example for the kids. The author found it ridiculous since they're both 26 and have been dating a year. He went along with it, trusting that next year they'd be allowed. Then, when younger couples arrived and shared tents without issue, he felt singled out and angry. The girlfriend agreed it was unfair, saying next year they'd share a tent. But this year, after the author pushed, the family said they needed to talk to others, and now they're still not allowed. The author refuses to go unless they can share a tent, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author's feelings about privacy and fairness. He's upset because other couples aren't treated the same way. It's a matter of being made an example of, which can be frustrating.\n2. The girlfriend's family's stance. They have their own rules and values, possibly traditional or conservative, about family events and setting examples for kids. They might see the author as part of the family now, hence holding a higher standard.\n3. Communication issues. The author tried to talk to the family directly but was blocked by the girlfriend, leading to tension between the couple.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings about being treated unfairly. It's reasonable to want privacy, especially in a committed relationship. The family's rules might be their own choice, but refusing to attend an event because of it is the author's right. However, the girlfriend's position is also valid from her family's perspective, and she might feel caught between her partner and her family's expectations.\n\nThe conflict arises from mismatched expectations. The author's frustration is justified as he's been treated differently without clear justification. The girlfriend's upset stems from the author not respecting her family's rules and causing tension. However, the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong because he's standing up for his comfort and the relationship's needs. The family's rules are their choice, but the author isn't obligated to comply if it causes personal distress. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing his and his girlfriend's comfort and privacy. His reaction is about respecting his boundaries. The family's rules might be inflexible, but that doesn't make the author wrong for wanting to share a tent. The girlfriend's frustration is more about the conflict between her partner and her family, but the core issue isn't the author's fault. He's advocating for his relationship's needs, which is a valid position.\n"
