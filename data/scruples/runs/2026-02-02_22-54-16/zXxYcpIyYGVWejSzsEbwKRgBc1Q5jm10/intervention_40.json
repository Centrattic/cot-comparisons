Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples at the event were allowed to. The author feels this is unfair, especially since they've been dating longer and the family made exceptions for others. The girlfriend initially agrees it's a problem but then her family refuses to let them share a tent again. The author decides not to go this year, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They were upset about the initial rule last year, which they found hypocritical when others were allowed to share tents. They expressed their feelings to their girlfriend, and she agreed they should share next year. When that didn't happen, the author's decision not to attend might be seen as standing up for his feelings, but it also caused the girlfriend to be upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family's stance could be rooted in cultural norms or personal values. They might have strict rules about family events, especially with younger relatives around. The author's girlfriend might feel pressured by her family and is trying to maintain harmony. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as a valid reaction to being treated unfairly, but it also disrupts the girlfriend's plans and might be hurtful to her.\n\nThe key points here are consent, respect, and communication. The author communicated his feelings to his girlfriend, who initially supported him. However, when the family refused to budge, the author made a choice that prioritized his own comfort over attending the event. The girlfriend's reaction is likely due to her needing to balance her family's expectations with her relationship. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his boundaries, but there's also a need to consider the girlfriend's position and the family dynamics. However, the decision to not attend could be seen as a reasonable response to being treated differently and not having his boundaries respected. So, the answer might be B, but there's nuance here.\n"
