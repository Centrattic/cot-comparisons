Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family campout where the author and his girlfriend are not allowed to share a tent, even though other couples who arrived later are. The family's reasoning is about setting a bad example for the kids, but the author feels this is unfair, especially since they've been together longer and are adults.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's family (the girlfriend's parents and relatives) are enforcing a rule to keep couples separate, maybe to maintain family traditions or protect their children's innocence. But the author and his girlfriend are adults, and the rule seems inconsistent when others are allowed to share tents. This inconsistency might be a key point here. The author is frustrated because he's being treated differently, and he's not the only one in a relationship, so the rule seems arbitrary.\n\nThe girlfriend initially agreed that next year they'd share a tent, but then the parents changed their mind, leading the author to decide not to attend. The girlfriend is upset because he's not going and doesn't want him to confront her family. So, who is wrong here?\n\nFrom the author's side, his feelings are valid. It's reasonable for a couple to want privacy, especially when others aren't being held to the same standard. The family's rule seems hypocritical if they allow other couples to share tents. The author's refusal to attend might be a justified stand for his boundaries, especially if the family isn't willing to compromise despite their agreement the previous year.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their reasons rooted in their values or traditions. The author might be overreacting if the family's decision is firm and non-negotiable. However, the inconsistency in applying the rule undermines their reasoning.\n\nThe girlfriend's role is a bit tricky. She agreed with her partner's frustration but then didn't follow through effectively with her family. Her insistence that the author not talk to her parents could be seen as her not advocating for their relationship's needs, which adds to the conflict.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing up for his and his partner's comfort and privacy, especially when the rules are inconsistently applied. The family's stance might be their choice, but the author is within his rights to prioritize his well-being and the relationship's health by choosing not to attend if his needs aren't met. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
