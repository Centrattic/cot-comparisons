Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation.\n\nSo the situation is that the author's girlfriend's family has a family campout. They didn't allow the couple to share a tent last year, even though they're both adults and have been dating for a year. The author found this stupid but went along with it because the girlfriend promised they'd share a tent next year. Then, when they went again this year, other younger couples were allowed to share tents, making the author feel singled out. They tried to get the girlfriend's family to agree to share a tent again, but the family refused after talking to other adults. The author decided not to go, which upset the girlfriend and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They feel that the family is being hypocritical by allowing other couples to share tents but not them. The author is adult, and sharing a tent with their partner is a reasonable expectation. The fact that other couples are allowed to do it makes the situation seem unfair. The author's frustration is valid because they're being treated differently without a clear reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's parents might have their own reasons. Maybe they're concerned about setting a good example for younger kids or have cultural/religious beliefs. However, the inconsistency with other couples sharing tents complicates that reasoning. The girlfriend agreed with the author's feelings last year but didn't follow up effectively this year. The author tried to communicate their stance, and when the family didn't budge, they decided not to attend, which is their right.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction being \"beyond pissed\" is a problem. The author didn't force confrontation; they tried to talk through the issue and even offered to talk to the family themselves. The girlfriend's refusal to allow communication might have led to the conflict. The author's decision to not attend because of being treated unfairly isn't necessarily wrong. Respecting one's boundaries and comfort is important.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. For example, attending the event without the tent-sharing requirement but trying to have a good time despite it. However, the author felt personally insulted, which is a strong emotion. The key is whether the author overstepped by not attending. If the family's rules are non-negotiable, maybe the author should have respected that. But given the inconsistency and the prior agreement, their reaction is understandable.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are a result of feeling unfairly treated. The family's inconsistency is a major factor. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their comfort and communicating their feelings. The girlfriend and family's reaction is more about the author's decision to not attend, which might be a result of the family not addressing the issue properly. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
