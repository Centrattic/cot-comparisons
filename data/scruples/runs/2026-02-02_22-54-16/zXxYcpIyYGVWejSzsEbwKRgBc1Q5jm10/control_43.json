Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout. The girlfriend's family thinks it's inappropriate and sets a bad example for the kids. The author and his girlfriend are both 26 and have been dating for a year. Last year, they didn't share a tent, but others who are younger and less established as a couple did. This made the author upset. He agreed to go along with it, but when others were allowed to share tents, he felt singled out. He expressed his frustration, and the girlfriend promised next year would be different. But this year, the family again refused, leading the author to not want to attend. The girlfriend is upset with him for not going and not talking to her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's frustration is understandable. They're an adult couple, and being separated from their partner in a setting where others aren't being restricted seems unfair. The family's reasoning is that it's a bad example for the kids, but if other couples are allowed to share tents, maybe the family's standards aren't consistent. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling insulted or for refusing to attend if the arrangement isn't fair. However, the girlfriend might feel the author is overreacting or not respecting her family's rules. But since the rules are inconsistently applied, the author has a valid reason to be upset. The girlfriend agreed with the author's feelings but didn't follow through on advocating for them, which might be her part of the issue. The author's decision not to attend is a personal choice, and while it might hurt the girlfriend, he has a right to his comfort and boundaries. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
