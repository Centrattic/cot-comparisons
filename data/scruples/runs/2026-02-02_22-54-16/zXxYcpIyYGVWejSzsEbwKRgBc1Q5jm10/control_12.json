Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author and their girlfriend not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, even though other younger couples are. The author is upset and decides not to go, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's family (the girlfriend's family) has their own rules about the campout. They might have cultural or traditional reasons for not allowing couples to share tents. Maybe they're trying to maintain a family-friendly environment, especially with kids around. The author's girlfriend initially agreed with the compromise, and even though they were annoyed, they went along with it. \n\nBut then, when other couples do share tents, the author feels singled out, which is understandable. The author's frustration is valid because they are in a committed relationship and feel that the rules are unfair. The fact that the girlfriend's family made exceptions for others but not for them could create a sense of hypocrisy, which the author is pointing out.\n\nThe author's decision to not attend the next year because of this issue might be seen as a reasonable stand, given that they've communicated their feelings. However, the girlfriend is upset because the author isn't going, which might affect her family event. The question is whether the author overreacted or if they have a legitimate reason to be upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family's decision to keep the rules consistent, even if others are doing it, might be their way of maintaining their values. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as dismissing their family's wishes. But the author isn't wrong for having boundaries and not wanting to be treated differently than others. \n\nThe key points are consent and mutual agreement. The author felt that after agreeing to the compromise, the family broke the promise by not allowing the tent-sharing. The girlfriend's family's refusal to make an exception even when others did might be the root of the problem here. The author isn't wrong for feeling insulted and for standing up for their relationship's privacy. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
