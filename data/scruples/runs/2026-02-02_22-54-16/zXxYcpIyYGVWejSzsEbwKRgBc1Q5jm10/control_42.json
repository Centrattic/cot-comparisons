Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a couple where the girlfriend's family doesn't allow them to share a tent during a family campout. They're both 26, have been dating a year, and the family thinks it's inappropriate and a bad example for the kids. The author is annoyed because other younger couples from the cousins' friends can share tents, but they can't. Last year, the girlfriend promised they'd share a tent next time. This year, they tried to negotiate but the family said no again. The author refuses to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend who's upset he's not attending.\n\nSo, the key points here are the family's rules versus the couple's relationship status. The author is upset because the rule seems inconsistent (other couples are allowed to share) and feels it's an insult. He argues that they're in a committed relationship, so why the double standard? The girlfriend is caught in the middle, and the author's refusal to attend might be seen as disrespectful to her family's wishes. \n\nBut wait, the author isn't wrong to feel disrespected. If the family's rules are arbitrary and don't apply to others, that's a problem. The fact that the author is being asked to compromise on something that's personal and affects their relationship is a valid concern. However, the girlfriend is trying to mediate, and the author is now refusing to attend, which could be seen as not respecting her efforts. But on the other hand, the family's rules are causing tension. \n\nThe girlfriend might be in a tough spot, trying to balance her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. The author's anger stems from being treated differently, which is understandable. But is it the author's fault for not going along with the family's decision? It's a conflict between personal autonomy and family tradition. \n\nIn such situations, both sides can have valid points. The family's perspective is about setting an example for kids, which might be their priority. The author's frustration comes from feeling excluded and inconsistent treatment. However, the author's decision to not attend the campout after the conflict might be seen as taking a hard stance, but if the family isn't willing to negotiate, maybe that's a reasonable response. \n\nConsidering the girlfriend's side: she agreed with the author's feelings but her family still refused. She might have hoped for a compromise but didn't push hard enough. The author's refusal could be a way to assert his boundaries, which isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is standing up for his relationship and the inconsistent rules.\n"
