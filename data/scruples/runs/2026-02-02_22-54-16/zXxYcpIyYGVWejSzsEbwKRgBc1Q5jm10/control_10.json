Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent during a family campout, even though other couples do so. The author is frustrated and decides not to attend, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The family's stance is based on their discomfort with a couple sharing a tent, possibly due to modesty or setting an example for kids. The author finds this hypocritical since other, younger couples can share tents. He tried to accept it initially but after the second incident, he's upset and refuses to go unless they can share a tent. His girlfriend agrees with him but her family then says they need to talk to other adults, leading to the same decision. The author then backs out, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship and is trying to respect boundaries by not confronting the family himself. His frustration is understandable given the inconsistency. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspective. Is respecting the family's rules important, or is the author justified in his reaction due to the hypocrisy?\n\nThe girlfriend's family's rules might be based on their values, which the author might not agree with. But relationships often require compromise. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as a valid stand for his comfort and the relationship's health. However, not attending might be a big move. Also, the girlfriend is upset because he's not going, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions are about his personal boundaries. If the family's rules are causing significant distress and the girlfriend is supportive in theory but the family doesn't budge, the author's decision to not attend to avoid conflict might be reasonable. However, if the girlfriend expects him to attend despite his discomfort to respect her family, he might be in the wrong.\n\nBut the girlfriend's family's rules seem inconsistent. Other couples are allowed to share tents, so the author's frustration is valid. The family's rules might not be fair, and the author is standing up for himself. However, perhaps the author should have found a middle ground, like talking to the family himself as he offered, instead of refusing to go. His girlfriend didn't want that approach, so maybe he should have tried to work with her to find another solution.\n\nOn the other hand, if the family is being unreasonable and causing the author distress, he's not wrong for prioritizing his own well-being. The fact that the girlfriend initially agreed with him but then the family changed their stance might indicate that the family isn't being fair. So the author's stance could be justified.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal was a reasonable response to an unfair situation. Since the family's rules are inconsistent and the author feels wronged, he's likely not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
