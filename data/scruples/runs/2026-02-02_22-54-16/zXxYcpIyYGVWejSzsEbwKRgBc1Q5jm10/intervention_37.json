Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples who are younger and have been together less time do share tents. The author is upset about this and decides not to go to the campout this year, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's perspective is that they're an adult couple in a committed relationship, and it's unfair that they can't share a tent when others can. They tried to compromise last year, but this year the family still refused. The girlfriend agreed with the author's frustration but couldn't get her parents to change their stance. The author then refuses to attend, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend's family's reasoning might be traditional or conservative, thinking it's inappropriate for a couple to share a tent in a family setting. However, the inconsistency with other couples is a problem. The author's decision to not go is a response to feeling disrespected and treated differently.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. They're expressing their feelings and making a choice based on their comfort. The family's rules might be their own, but enforcing them on the couple could be seen as overstepping, especially when others aren't held to the same standard. The author isn't forcing the issue; they're standing by their decision after previous agreements fell through. The girlfriend's reaction is about the author not going, but the author's stance is about respecting their own boundaries. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own comfort and the respect they deserve in their relationship.\n"
