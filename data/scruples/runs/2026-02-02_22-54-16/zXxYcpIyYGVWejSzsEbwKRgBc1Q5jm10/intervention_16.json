Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend's family doesn't want them to share a tent during a family camping trip. They're both 26, have been dating for a year, and the family thinks it's inappropriate. But then other younger couples from the cousins' friends are allowed to share tents. The author is upset because he feels singled out and thinks it's unfair. He tried to talk to his girlfriend, who agreed with him last year, but this year the family still said no. Now he's refusing to go, and the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being reasonable. The family's objection is based on their values or beliefs, maybe wanting to set a good example for kids. But the author is an adult, and they're in a committed relationship. The fact that other couples are allowed to share tents complicates things. If the rules are inconsistent, maybe the family isn't applying them fairly. The author's frustration is valid because he's being treated differently from others. \n\nThen, the girlfriend's role is important. She initially supported the author's wish to share a tent but didn't follow through. Now she's insisting he go despite his objections. The author is standing up for himself, which is understandable. But has he overstepped by refusing to attend the campout? Maybe the girlfriend's family has their reasons, and the author is making a bigger deal out of it than necessary. Or is he justified in feeling disrespected?\n\nOn the other hand, the author is prioritizing his own comfort and the relationship's dynamics. If the campout is important to his girlfriend, refusing to go might hurt her feelings. But if the situation is causing stress every year, maybe it's better for him to opt out. The key points are respect for boundaries versus personal autonomy. The family's rules vs. adult privacy. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's advocating for his needs and the situation isn't being handled fairly by the family. The inconsistency in the rules and the family's resistance despite the couple's maturity support his stance. However, communication is key. The girlfriend's refusal to let him talk to her parents might be a problem, but the author isn't at fault for refusing to attend if the conditions don't change. So the answer should be B.\n"
