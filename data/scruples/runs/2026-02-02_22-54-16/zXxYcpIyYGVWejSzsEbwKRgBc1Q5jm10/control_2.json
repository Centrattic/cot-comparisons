Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author and his girlfriend are being forced to sleep in separate tents by her family during a family campout. They're both 26 and have been dating for a year. The family didn't allow them to share a tent because they thought it would set a bad example for the kids. But other couples who arrived later, which are younger and have been together less time, were allowed to share tents. The author was upset about this discrepancy and expressed his frustration. The girlfriend agreed with him, but when the next year came around, the family again refused, and the author decided not to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nSo, the main points here are the family's rules, the inconsistency in applying those rules (other couples allowed to share), and the author's decision to not attend the campout. The girlfriend is upset that he's not going and didn't want him to talk to her parents.\n\nFirst, the family's stance: they don't want the couple to share a tent. But the reasoning seems a bit inconsistent because other couples are allowed. This inconsistency is a problem. The author's frustration is understandable because he feels singled out. The girlfriend agreed with him the first time but didn't push her parents to change their stance, which might indicate she's conflicted.\n\nThe author's decision to not attend: is that the wrong move? He's standing up for his boundaries, which is his right. However, maybe he should have tried to resolve it with the family first. But since the girlfriend is in a position to mediate, and she refused his offer to talk directly, perhaps the author has a valid reason to be upset. The girlfriend's anger at his decision might be because she wants to maintain family relationships and didn't want to cause a scene. However, the author's feelings about being treated unfairly are also valid. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's choosing not to attend an event that his girlfriend's family is hosting, which could be seen as disrespectful if he's not trying to resolve it. But given the family's inconsistency and the repeated refusal to accommodate, maybe he's justified. The girlfriend's refusal to let him talk to her parents complicates things. The author's actions are a personal boundary, which is okay, but whether it's the right approach depends on context. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Considering the family's inconsistency and the girlfriend's agreement with his frustration, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself, and the family's rules are problematic. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
