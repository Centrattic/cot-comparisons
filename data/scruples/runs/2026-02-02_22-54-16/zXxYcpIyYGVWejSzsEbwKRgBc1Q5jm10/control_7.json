Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for being upset about not sharing a tent at the family campout.\n\nSo, the situation is that the girlfriend's family doesn't allow the couple to share a tent, but other couples at the event do. The author is 26, in a year-long relationship, and finds the rule silly. He's annoyed because he's being treated differently, especially when others younger with shorter relationships get to share tents. He ends up refusing to attend the next year if they can't share a tent, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, considering the age and relationship duration: they're both adults, and a year-long relationship is significant. The family's rule seems inconsistent since other couples aren't restricted. The author's frustration is valid because the double standard exists. The girlfriend's family made exceptions for others, which might indicate their rule isn't about appropriateness but possibly control or traditional views.\n\nThe author's reaction: he's not violent or disrespectful. He expressed his feelings calmly and set a boundary. The girlfriend agreed to his concerns the previous year but then failed to stand up to her family. The family's refusal to accommodate after discussion shows they're not listening. The author's decision to not attend is a boundary to respect his own needs, which is reasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's upset is partly because he's not going, but she also agreed with him before. The problem here is the family's inflexibility and the double standard. The author isn't wrong to be upset; he's standing up for his relationship's privacy and equality. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
