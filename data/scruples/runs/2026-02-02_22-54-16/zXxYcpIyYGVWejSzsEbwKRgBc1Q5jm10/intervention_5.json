Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who were not allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples were. The author is upset about this and decided not to go this year, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the family's reasoning was that it's inappropriate to set a bad example for the kids. But the couple has been together for a year, both are adults. The author found this rule unfair, especially when other couples, some younger and in shorter relationships, were allowed to share tents. That inconsistency probably added to his frustration.\n\nThe girlfriend initially supported the idea of sharing a tent next year, but when it came time, her parents changed their mind and insisted on separation again. The author then refused to attend the campout, which upset the girlfriend. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's dealing with a double standard. His family's rules apply unevenly, which can feel discriminatory. Being forced to sleep separately in a camp filled with relatives might be uncomfortable and feel disrespectful. The fact that other couples aren't subject to the same rule suggests that the policy isn't consistently applied, which adds to the injustice.\n\nThe girlfriend seems to be caught between her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. She agreed with the author's frustration but didn't push back effectively with her parents. Instead, she let the author handle it, and when he refused, she got upset. \n\nThe author's decision to not attend is based on feeling that the situation is unfair and that his relationship is being stigmatized. It's understandable that he'd prioritize his comfort and the integrity of his relationship over attending a family event that's causing conflict. However, by not going, he might have ignored his girlfriend's desire to maintain family ties, which could be valid for her.\n\nBut considering the context, the author's actions are a response to a consistent pattern of unfair treatment. The family's rules are inconsistent, and the author's refusal to comply isn't without reason. He's standing up for his rights and the respect of his relationship. The girlfriend's upset reaction might be more about her own conflict between family and partner than the author being wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
