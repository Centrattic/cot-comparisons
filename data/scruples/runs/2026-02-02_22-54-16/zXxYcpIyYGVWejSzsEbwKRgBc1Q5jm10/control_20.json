Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples, even younger ones, do. The author is upset and decides not to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they're being treated unfairly. They're a couple for a year, both 26, and other couples are allowed to share tents. The family's rule seems inconsistent. The author's frustration is understandable because they feel singled out. Plus, they were promised last year that next year they could share, but the family backtracked.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, maybe cultural or traditional, about modesty or setting an example for kids. The girlfriend might be caught between her partner and her family, trying to maintain harmony. She agreed to talk to her parents again, but they still said no. The author then refuses to go, which upsets the girlfriend.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to attend? Well, the family's decision is their own, but the author's feelings are valid. Forcing them to sleep separately in a family event could be seen as intrusive. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They communicated their feelings and tried to resolve it through the girlfriend. When that failed, choosing not to attend is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel torn, but the author isn't at fault for standing up for their comfort and privacy. The family's inconsistency (other couples allowed) adds to the unfairness. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The key points are the family's rule being inconsistent and the author's valid frustration leading to a personal decision.\n"
