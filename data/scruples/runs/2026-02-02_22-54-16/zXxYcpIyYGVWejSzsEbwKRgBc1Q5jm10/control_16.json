Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a family camping trip where the girlfriend's family doesn't allow the couple to share a tent, but other couples do. The author is upset about being treated differently, especially since they've been in a long-term relationship. They tried to address it the next year, but the family still said no, leading the author to refuse to attend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The family's rule seems inconsistent because other couples share tents without issues. The author feels singled out, which is understandable. The girlfriend initially promised they'd share a tent the next year but then her family reversed the decision. The author's frustration is valid because they were led on, and the situation was unfair. \n\nThe girlfriend's family's reasoning might be based on conservative views or wanting to set an example for kids, but their application is inconsistent. The author isn't the one enforcing the rule; they're being denied a right that others have. The girlfriend's insistence that the author attend despite his discomfort shows she might not fully support his position, which adds to the conflict.\n\nThe author's response\u2014refusing to go\u2014is a reaction to being treated unfairly. While it's their choice to opt out of the trip, the girlfriend is upset because he's not complying with her wish to attend. But given the circumstances, the author's stance isn't unreasonable. They have a right to feel disrespected and to set boundaries. The family's inconsistency is the main issue here, and the author isn't at fault for standing up for their feelings. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
