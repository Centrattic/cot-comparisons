Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent during a family camping trip, even though other couples are allowed. The author is upset about this and eventually decides not to go to the next campout, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the family's insistence on separating the couple, despite them being in a committed relationship. The author feels this is unfair, especially when younger couples are allowed to share tents. He tried to handle it by discussing with his girlfriend and even offered to talk to her parents, but she refused. Then, after the family said they needed to discuss with other adults and came back with the same policy, the author decides not to attend the campout, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. \n\nI should consider the cultural or family dynamics here. It's possible that the family has traditional views about boundaries, especially around children. However, the author and his girlfriend are both adults, and it's a family event where other couples are allowed to share tents. The inconsistency here might be a problem. The author's frustration is understandable because he's being treated differently without a clear reason. \n\nThe author tried to communicate his feelings and even agreed to compromise for the next year, but the family didn't follow through. When he decides not to attend, it's a reasonable reaction given the prior conflict. His girlfriend's reaction being \"beyond pissed\" might stem from her valuing family time over his discomfort, which is a different perspective but not necessarily making the author wrong. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no right or wrong here, but in terms of social expectations. The author's actions seem justified because he's standing up for his comfort and the respect of his relationship. The family's rules are causing him distress, and he's within his rights to set boundaries. His girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel caught between her family's expectations and her partner's needs. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The family's stance is the main issue, and the author's response is a valid reaction to being treated unfairly. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
