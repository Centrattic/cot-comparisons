Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is frustrated because his girlfriend's family made them sleep separately at a family campout, even though other couples there were allowed to share tents. They had agreed the previous year that they'd share a tent the next time, but the family changed their minds again. The author refuses to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the family's stance seems inconsistent. Other couples, some younger and less established, were allowed to share tents without issue. This inconsistency might make the author feel singled out. The author is within his rights to be upset, as it's a personal matter between him and his girlfriend regarding their relationship dynamics. \n\nHowever, the author's decision not to attend might affect the girlfriend's family time. The girlfriend's insistence on going despite his discomfort could be a point of contention. The author's refusal to speak to the parents as suggested by the girlfriend might come off as passive-aggressive if he's not willing to engage in communication. But given the situation, the author's stance is understandable. The core issue is the family's double standard. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expressing his feelings and setting boundaries. The family's actions are the main problem here. So the answer should be B.\n"
