Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples are allowed. \n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend are both 26 and have been dating for a year. The family doesn't let them share a tent, thinking it's inappropriate and a bad example for kids. The author is annoyed because other younger couples are sharing tents without any issue. He feels singled out and insulted.\n\nHe tried to go along with it last year, trusting that next year they could share. But when the time came, the family again refused, even though other couples were allowed. The author is now refusing to go to the campout, which upsets his girlfriend. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nLooking at the author's actions: He expressed his feelings to his girlfriend, who initially agreed. When the family changed their mind, he decided not to attend. The girlfriend is upset because he's not going and doesn't want him to talk to her parents. \n\nThe key points here are about respect and boundaries. The author's feelings are valid; being treated differently from others in the same situation can be hurtful. However, his response is to not attend the event, which affects his girlfriend. The girlfriend is caught between her family's wishes and her partner's feelings. \n\nThe author's actions stem from feeling disrespected and frustrated. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might be trying to maintain family harmony. But the author isn't being unreasonable in wanting to share a tent with his partner, especially when others aren't being judged. \n\nThe family's rules are subjective and may not consider the couple's maturity or relationship status. The author isn't at fault for standing up for his feelings. His girlfriend might have handled it differently, but he's not the one being disrespectful. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
