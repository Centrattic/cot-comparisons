Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout. The author's girlfriend's family says it's inappropriate for them to share a tent, even though other couples there are allowed. The author is upset because they're treated differently and eventually decides not to go to the next campout unless they can share a tent. His girlfriend is upset with him for not going and for not talking to her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. He's standing up for his own boundaries. The family is imposing a rule that affects him, but others aren't held to the same standard. He's not being disrespectful; he's expressing his feelings and making a choice based on his comfort. His girlfriend agreed with him initially but then the family changed their decision. He tried to talk to his girlfriend about it, and when she wouldn't let him approach her parents, he refused to attend. That seems reasonable because he's not willing to be in a situation he finds offensive. \n\nIs there a cultural or family norm that might explain their stance? Maybe the family is conservative or has certain expectations. But even so, the inconsistency with other couples is a problem. The author isn't wrong to feel resentful or to set boundaries. His girlfriend, however, might be caught between her family's expectations and her partner's needs, which complicates things. But the question is about the author's responsibility. He's not making an unreasonable demand; he's seeking respect and consistency. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
