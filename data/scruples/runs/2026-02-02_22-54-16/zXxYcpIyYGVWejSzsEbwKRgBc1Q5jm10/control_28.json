Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent during a family campout, even though other couples (younger ones) are allowed. The author was annoyed last year and agreed to attend again on the promise they'd share a tent. This year, after the same thing happened despite other couples being together, he decided not to go, which upset his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He's an adult, in a committed relationship for over a year, and feels it's reasonable to share a tent. The family's rule seems inconsistent and unfair, especially since other couples aren't facing the same restriction. His frustration is understandable given the hypocrisy. He communicated his feelings and even offered to talk to her parents but was blocked. So, he's standing up for his own comfort and boundaries, which makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side: She might feel pressured by her family's traditions or religious/cultural values. She agreed with the author's stance last year and tried to keep him on board this year, but her parents overruled. Her being upset when he refuses to attend could be because she values family time and doesn't want to lose that or cause conflict with her family. She might feel caught between her partner and her family.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: He didn't confront her parents directly unless she allowed it. He expressed his feelings and set a boundary by choosing not to attend. That's his right. The family's rules are infringing on his personal space and privacy with his partner. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own needs after being respected in past discussions. The real issue is the family's inconsistency and her inability to negotiate effectively. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
