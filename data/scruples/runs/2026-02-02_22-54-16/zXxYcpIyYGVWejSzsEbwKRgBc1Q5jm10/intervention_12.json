Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples are. The author is upset and refuses to go this year, leading to conflict with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's family has a rule that the couple can't share a tent, even though other couples (younger ones) do. The author was annoyed last year but held back, and then when the same thing happened again this year, he refused to go, making his girlfriend upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the family's rules might be based on their values or trying to maintain a family-friendly environment. The author's girlfriend agreed last year that next time they'd share a tent, but the family changed their mind again. The author is frustrated because he feels singled out, and his refusal to attend is a reaction to being treated differently.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is prioritizing his own comfort and relationship boundaries. The family's insistence on separation might be overstepping, especially since other couples aren't subject to the same rule. The author's reaction is understandable given that he felt respected last year but then again this year. His girlfriend's insistence that he go despite his discomfort might be putting pressure on him to compromise his feelings for the sake of the family event.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by refusing to attend. If his refusal was based on valid reasons and the family's inconsistent treatment, then he's justified. However, if he didn't communicate properly or acted inconsiderately toward his girlfriend, that could be an issue. But in the narrative, he tried to talk to her, offered to speak to her parents, and she refused. He felt personally insulted and the situation was unfair. His decision not to go is a personal choice based on his boundaries. \n\nThe girlfriend's upset might be because she wanted to maintain family harmony, but the author's feelings are also valid. The family's rules are inconsistent, and the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his comfort and expressing his feelings. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
