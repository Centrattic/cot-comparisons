Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and his girlfriend are not allowed to share a tent at her family's annual campout because the family thinks it's inappropriate and sets a bad example for the kids. The author is annoyed, especially when other younger couples share tents without issue. Last year, the girlfriend promised they'd get their own tent next time. This year, even after the author's girlfriend agrees with him, her parents change their minds and they're kept separate again. The author refuses to go and the girlfriend is upset. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: The family's rules seem inconsistent because other couples are allowed to share tents. The author feels singled out and respected boundaries from the previous year were broken. The girlfriend initially agreed but then the family changed their stance without consultation. The author's refusal to attend is based on the repeated offense and feeling disrespected.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the family's reasoning might stem from their values, but applying it inconsistently could be seen as unfair. The author's reaction is about respecting his autonomy and relationship dynamics. The girlfriend's parents might be projecting their values onto the couple, which could be a point of contention. The author is standing up for his relationship's needs, which is valid. His girlfriend is upset because maybe she feels the family's rules are non-negotiable or doesn't want to create conflict. But the author has a right to be uncomfortable with the situation after the previous promise. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his boundaries and the family's inconsistency makes their stance problematic. The answer should be B.\n"
