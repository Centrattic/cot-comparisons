Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, even though other younger couples can. The author is upset and decides not to go, causing a conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He's in a committed relationship, a year-long, with his girlfriend. Last year, the family didn't let them share a tent, but other couples who are younger and have been together less time did. He felt it was unfair and annoying. This year, the same thing happens again, and he refuses to attend, leading to the girlfriend being upset.\n\nThe girlfriend's side: She agreed with the author's frustration last year and promised they'd share a tent this year. But when he pushed her to talk to her parents, they said no again. She wants him to go despite the issue, and he refuses, making her angry.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The family's rules are inconsistent. Other couples are allowed to share tents, so their objection seems hypocritical. The author's reaction is based on feeling treated unfairly. He's in a long-term relationship and thus might see this as a personal slight. His refusal to attend might be seen as a reasonable boundary, especially if he's not willing to tolerate what he perceives as disrespect.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he's trying to stand up for his own comfort and relationship boundaries. The family's rules might be traditional or based on their values, but the inconsistency (letting other couples share tents) could make the rule seem arbitrary. The author isn't being aggressive; he's expressing frustration and choosing not to attend. The girlfriend is upset because he's prioritizing his feelings over her family's event, which she might value. However, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to comply with a rule that seems unfair and inconsistent. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
