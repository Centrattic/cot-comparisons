Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples do. The author is upset and decides not to go, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The family's reasoning is that it's inappropriate and sets a bad example for the kids. The author is 26, in a one-year relationship, and finds the rule unfair, especially since other younger couples are allowed to share. He agreed last year because the girlfriend promised they could share next year. But when they tried to arrange it, the family said they needed to talk to others and then denied again. The author then refuses to attend, causing his girlfriend to be upset.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The family's stance is based on their values and concern for their kids. They might see it as a family tradition or a way to maintain certain standards. On the other hand, the author feels it's unfair and that his relationship isn't respected, especially since others aren't faced with the same restrictions. \n\nThe author's actions led to not attending the campout. The girlfriend is upset because he's not going and didn't talk to her parents as she asked. The author might think he's justified in his frustration, but is he overreacting? Well, he's not wrong to feel disrespected. However, in a relationship, sometimes compromising is necessary. If the girlfriend is on his side and agreed with him, but still insists he go, maybe there's a different dynamic. \n\nThe family's rules might be non-negotiable for them, and the author's refusal to attend could be seen as a way out to avoid the situation. But if the family is unwilling to budge, then the author's choice not to attend might be a reasonable decision to protect his own comfort and relationship. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction shows that she's invested in maintaining family relations. If the author's refusal to attend is causing her distress, maybe he should consider other options, like discussing it more with her or finding a compromise. But he already tried and the family said no. So maybe he's not in the wrong here. The core issue is about conflicting values between the couple and the family. The author's stance is about personal boundaries and respect in a committed relationship, which is valid. The family's stance is about their rules and protecting their children, which is also valid. \n\nIn terms of the question, the author isn't necessarily the asshole here. He's standing up for his relationship's privacy and his own comfort. The girlfriend is caught between her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. The author's decision not to go might be a justified choice given the circumstances. So the answer should be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
