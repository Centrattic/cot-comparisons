Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout despite being in a long-term relationship, while others who are younger and less established are allowed. The author is upset because they feel singled out and the girlfriend agreed with them but the family still didn't change their stance. The author then decides not to go to the campout and the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they're being treated unfairly. They're in a committed relationship and feel that the family's rules are hypocritical since others are allowed to share tents. They tried to handle it by discussing with the girlfriend, who agreed, but the family didn't follow through. The author's frustration led them to refuse going, which caused conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, maybe cultural or traditional, about maintaining certain boundaries in family events. They might not want to set a precedent or think it's inappropriate for couples to share tents regardless of their relationship status. The girlfriend might be caught between her partner and her family's wishes, leading her to be upset when the author decides not to go despite her agreeing to try again.\n\nThe key points here are fairness, respect, and communication. The author felt respected when they were in a longer, more serious relationship, yet were treated differently. They communicated their feelings and even offered to talk to the family but were refused. The family's decision to keep the rule despite the author's objections could be seen as not respecting their relationship. However, the author's decision to not attend might have hurt the girlfriend, who might have hoped to maintain family harmony.\n\nIs the author wrong for not attending? Well, the family's stance didn't change, and the author felt it was a deal-breaker for them. They had a valid reason for being upset, given the inconsistent treatment. However, choosing not to attend might have been a personal choice based on their feelings, which is understandable. But it could also be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over the girlfriend's desire to maintain family ties, which could strain their relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for their feelings, but they might not have considered the girlfriend's position as much. However, the family's rules might also be unreasonable. The main issue is the lack of resolution and the resulting conflict.\n"
