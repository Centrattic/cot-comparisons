Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout. The author is upset because they feel singled out, especially when other couples they met at the event were allowed to share tents. They tried to address the issue, but the girlfriend's family still decided to keep them separate again the next year, leading to the author refusing to attend and causing conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's family has their own rules, possibly based on their values or beliefs. The author is in a committed relationship with his girlfriend, who is 26, and they've been dating a year. The family's objection seems to be about setting a good example for the kids, even though the couple is adults. The author finds this rule unreasonable, especially since other couples weren't reprimanded.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. The family's stance vs. the couple's expectations.\n2. The author's frustration at being treated differently.\n3. The girlfriend's position: she agrees with the author's feelings but seems to prioritize family harmony over his comfort.\n4. The author's decision to not attend the event, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the family has the right to set their own rules for their event, even if the author disagrees. However, the author is an adult in a relationship and has a right to feel respected. The issue is whether refusing to share a tent is a reasonable family rule, and whether the author's reaction (refusing to attend) is justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's family might have their reasons, but they don't consider the couple's relationship status and autonomy. The author's frustration is valid because they're being treated differently from others. However, he's making a choice not to attend the event, which affects his partner and her family's plans. The girlfriend is upset because he's prioritizing his comfort over her desire to attend with her family.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by refusing to attend. If the family rules are non-negotiable, the couple might have to accept it to participate in the family event. The author's refusal could be seen as disrespecting the family's wishes, which might place him in the wrong. But if the family is being unfair, then the author's stance is understandable.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend is in a position to mediate. She agreed with the author's feelings but still wanted to go, leading to the author's decision to not attend. The author's refusal might be justified if the family isn't compromising, but it's a conflict between personal comfort and family obligations.\n\nIn summary, the family has the right to their rules, but the author's reaction is based on valid feelings of being treated unfairly. However, choosing not to attend the event might be seen as inconsiderate of the girlfriend's family ties. It's a tough call, but the author isn't entirely wrong. His frustration is justified, but refusing to attend could be seen as a selfish decision that disregards his partner's wishes. So, maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because his feelings are valid, but it's a complex situation where both sides have points.\n"
