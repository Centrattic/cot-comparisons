Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent during a family campout. \n\nFirst, the background: The family campout is an annual event. Last year, the couple wasn't allowed to share a tent because the family thought it would set a bad example for the kids. The author's girlfriend assured him they could share next year. This year, they went again, and three younger couples arrived and shared tents without any issue. The author felt singled out and frustrated because they were the only ones separated despite being in a longer, more committed relationship. He tried to talk to his girlfriend about it, but she didn't want him to approach her parents. He declined to go this year, which upset her.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the situation. The key points are consent and respect. The author is upset about not being allowed to share a tent while others do. The family's reasoning is about setting an example for the kids. But the author and his girlfriend are both adults in a committed relationship. The family's double standard (allowing younger couples with less time together to share tents) might be the issue here. \n\nThe author's girlfriend agreed with him last year, but this time, she didn't support his decision to not go. The author felt it was a personal insult and that his autonomy was being disregarded. His refusal to attend because of the tent issue could be seen as standing up for his boundaries. However, the girlfriend is upset because he didn't go as planned. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the family's rules seem inconsistent. The author isn't wrong for feeling wronged, especially since he's an adult with his own boundaries. The problem might lie with the family's policies rather than the author's decision. His girlfriend's refusal to let him talk to her parents might have contributed to the conflict. But the author's choice to not attend because of the tent issue is his right, given the circumstances. So, he's not in the wrong.\n"
