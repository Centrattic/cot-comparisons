Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples (even younger ones with shorter relationships) are allowed. The author feels it's unfair and decides not to attend the next year, leading to a conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The family's stance is based on appropriateness and setting an example for kids. The author is upset because they're the only couple separated, and he's been promised a tent next time but it didn't happen. The girlfriend agrees with him but then doesn't support him when the family says no again. The author refuses to go, causing her to get angry.\n\nNow, considering the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) framework. The author's actions are driven by feeling respected and valued. The family's rules might be their own, but they're inconsistent if other couples are allowed. The author isn't doing anything wrong by standing up for his feelings. The girlfriend's family's policy is the main issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to comply with a rule that seems unfair, especially when it's not applied equally. The girlfriend's frustration might come from feeling caught between her family and her partner's feelings.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's justified in feeling upset about the unfair treatment and his decision not to attend is a personal choice, especially when the family isn't respecting their relationship boundaries.\n"
