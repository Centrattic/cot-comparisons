Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend's family doesn't allow them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other younger couples are doing so. The author is frustrated, feels singled out, and decides not to go this year, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's main issue is that the family's rule seems inconsistent\u2014other couples are allowed to share tents, but not them. They felt it was unfair, especially since they've been dating longer and are both adults. The author tried to handle it by discussing it with his girlfriend, who initially agreed things would change, but then the family didn't follow through. When the author refuses to go, the girlfriend is upset, leading to the question of who's wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me consider both sides. From the author's perspective, being treated differently when others aren't held to the same standard is frustrating. They're adults, so expecting them to sleep separately might be seen as unnecessary. Plus, the girlfriend's family didn't enforce the rule consistently, which adds to the feeling of unfairness.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might have their reasons, like maintaining traditions or setting an example for younger kids. The girlfriend agreed to mediate but didn't push enough, leading to the author's decision to not attend. The girlfriend's frustration comes from the author not going, which might affect family time or relationships.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They expressed their feelings and tried to resolve it through their girlfriend. When the situation didn't change, they decided not to participate, which is a personal choice. The girlfriend's upset stems from the author's refusal, but the root issue is the family's inconsistent rule. The author's actions are a reaction to what they perceive as unfair treatment. So, probably not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
