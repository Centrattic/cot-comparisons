Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples are. The author is upset and decides not to go, causing conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend's family has rules about couples not sharing a tent, but other couples at the event do. The author is frustrated because they're being treated differently. The girlfriend agrees with him the previous year and promises a tent next year. But when the next year comes, the family says they need to talk to others, and the decision is made again. The author refuses to go, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants validation. \n\nThe author's actions: He expressed his feelings, tried to resolve the issue through the girlfriend, and when that failed, refused to attend. The girlfriend is upset because he didn't go and didn't talk to her parents. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author has a right to feel respected. Being treated differently from other couples can be seen as unfair, especially when the reasoning is unclear. The family's rules are subjective and may be hypocritical. The author's refusal could be seen as a stand for his boundaries, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend's position is that she's trying to maintain family harmony. But she agreed with the author's frustration last year. This year, she didn't get the tent issue resolved and still wants him to go. \n\nThe author's decision not to attend is based on his discomfort and feeling disrespected. It's a personal choice, and while it caused conflict, it's not necessarily wrong if he's honest about his feelings. The girlfriend might feel he's overreacting, but the situation does involve unfair treatment. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer would be B (No) because he's standing up for his boundaries in a situation where there's inconsistency and potential hypocrisy from the other side. The girlfriend's family's rules are problematic, and the author isn't at fault for not attending when his comfort and respect aren't prioritized.\n"
