But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to report a cashier who was rude in another language. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she talked bad about customers in Korean, thinking the author was Japanese. Recently, after the cashier mumbled some harsh words in Korean, the author is conflicted about reporting her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier was being disrespectful, even if not in English. The author overheard her, understood her, and is upset. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and could be considered harassment. The author's intention is to address the behavior without causing termination, which is a reasonable approach. \n\nBut wait, the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so maybe she didn't intend to target the author specifically. However, the behavior itself is inappropriate regardless of the language used. The author has a right to work in an environment free from harassment. Reporting it is a valid step to ensure a respectful atmosphere. Also, the cashier's comments were derogatory towards customers, which affects everyone, not just the author. \n\nThe author is trying to balance reporting the issue without being vindictive. The manager should be informed so they can address the behavior. The cashier's actions might violate workplace policies, so the author isn't in the wrong for bringing it up. The answer should be B, the author isn't at fault.\n"
