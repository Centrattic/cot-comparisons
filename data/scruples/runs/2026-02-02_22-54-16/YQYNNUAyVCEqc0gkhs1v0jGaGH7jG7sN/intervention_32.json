But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and is bilingual. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the author can understand. Recently, the cashier said something offensive about the author wanting to go back to Japan, implying they're not Japanese. The author wants to report this but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's behavior. She's been making derogatory remarks towards customers, which is unprofessional. Even if she didn't know the author was Korean, making such comments is unacceptable. The cashier's comment about the author being Japanese and then telling them to go back to Japan is clearly offensive, regardless of her intent. The author is within their rights to address this.\n\nThe author is concerned about the cashier's job security, which shows empathy. Reporting the issue to the manager is a reasonable step to prevent similar incidents with other customers. The manager should be informed so they can handle the situation appropriately, maybe through training or disciplinary action without firing her immediately.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so maybe she didn't mean harm. But even without knowing the listener, using derogatory language in a workplace is still wrong. The cashier's job requires professionalism, and her comments are unprofessional and could be discriminatory if based on ethnicity or national origin.\n\nThe author's desire to report the cashier to stop the behavior is justified. It's about ensuring a respectful environment for all customers. The author isn't taking a vindictive approach but wants the behavior to stop. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
