But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The situation is that the cashier was speaking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author can understand because he's Korean. The cashier didn't realize the author is Korean and made a comment during a transaction. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The cashier was using a language to talk about customers, assuming they don't understand. That's problematic because it's unprofessional and disrespectful. The author, being bilingual, caught her. The cashier's comment was not only about the 50-cent discrepancy but also included a personal attack about going back to Japan and implying the customer is broke. That crosses the line from just complaining to being offensive.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior but not to get the cashier fired. He's concerned about her well-being and doesn't want her to be in trouble, but the behavior is unprofessional. Employers generally have policies against such conduct. Reporting it is a responsible action because it's about maintaining a respectful workplace and customer environment.\n\nAlso, the cashier's assumption that the author is Japanese because of his appearance is part of why she spoke in Korean. But that doesn't justify her behavior. The author has a right to be treated with respect, regardless of her assumptions. The fact that the cashier avoided eye contact after the comment suggests she was aware it was wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's taking a stand against unprofessional behavior without wanting to cause harm. Reporting it is the right move because it's about addressing the issue appropriately through the proper channels. The answer should be B (No).\n"
