But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier. The cashier has been mumbling negative things in Korean during checkout, and the author, who is Korean but looks Japanese, found out the cashier was insulting her in Korean. Now, the author wants to report this to the manager but is worried about the cashier getting fired.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The cashier was being rude, but doing it in Korean, not realizing the author is Korean. The author has been keeping this a secret and is now considering reporting the behavior. The cashier's comments were about the customer being demanding, making her life hard, etc. The author is bilingual but the cashier assumed she didn't speak Korean because of her appearance.\n\nSo the question is, is it the author's fault to want to report this? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe cashier's behavior is unprofessional. Shit-talking customers, even if not in a language the customer understands, could be considered inappropriate. The author was targeted after a price discrepancy, and the cashier's comments were specifically directed at her. Since the author is bilingual, she could have been hurt by this. \n\nBut the author is in a position where she can choose to address it. The store's employees might have a policy against such behavior, so reporting the cashier could be the right thing to do. However, the author is concerned about the cashier's job security. The cashier didn't intend for the author to hear, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the cashier didn't realize the author is Korean. The author could choose to confront her privately first, but the situation escalated. The cashier's comment about sending the author back to Japan is offensive, regardless of the language. \n\nThe manager should be informed about the cashier's unprofessional conduct. The author's intention isn't to get her fired, but to stop the behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report it. The cashier's actions are the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
