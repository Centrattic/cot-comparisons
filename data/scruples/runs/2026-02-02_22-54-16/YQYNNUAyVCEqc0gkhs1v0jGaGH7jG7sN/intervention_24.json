But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumed they didn't understand Korean. The cashier mumbled complaints in Korean, but when the author confronted a pricing error, the cashier said some harsh things in Korean, which the author understood. Now they want to report this to the manager but don't want the cashier fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier didn't realize the author was Korean. The author is bilingual, so they heard the negative comments. The cashier's comments were not highly offensive but included a racial slur (go back to Japan) when the pricing mistake was pointed out. \n\nThe author wants to report the behavior but is concerned about the cashier's job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the cashier made a racial slur or discriminatory comment, that could be actionable. Even if it's in another language, if the customer understands and reports it, the employer might need to address it. The cashier might have violated company policies regarding harassment or discrimination. \n\nThe author's intent is to stop the negative behavior without causing the cashier to lose their job. The author isn't seeking revenge but wants the behavior to stop. The cashier's comments were unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report this. They have a right to a respectful shopping environment. The cashier's actions were inappropriate, and the author is justified in reporting it, especially since they have evidence of understanding the comments. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
