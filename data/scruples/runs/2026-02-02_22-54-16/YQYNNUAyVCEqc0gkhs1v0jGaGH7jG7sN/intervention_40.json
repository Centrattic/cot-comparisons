But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but is mistaken for Japanese, so the cashier speaks English to them. The cashier mumbled complaints in Korean, but the author didn't confront her until an incident where the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, which the author understood. Now the author wants to report the cashier without getting her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, assuming the customers don't understand. The author, being bilingual, can understand and is upset. The cashier's comment was specifically targeting the author, referencing their appearance and making a 50-cent issue personal. \n\nIs the author justified in reporting? Well, the cashier's behavior could be considered professional misconduct. Even if the cashier thought the customers didn't understand Korean, making derogatory remarks about customers is unprofessional and could create a hostile environment. The author isn't looking to get her fired but wants the behavior to stop. The manager should be informed because it's about workplace conduct affecting customers.\n\nThe cashier's actions are inappropriate regardless of the language used. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this. They had a right to be treated professionally. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
