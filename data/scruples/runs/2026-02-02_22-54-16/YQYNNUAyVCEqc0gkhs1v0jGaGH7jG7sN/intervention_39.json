But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The situation is that the cashier was mumbling negative comments in Korean, which the author, being Korean but mistaken as Japanese, didn't realize she could understand. The cashier made a derogatory comment when the author pointed out a pricing error. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the cashier's actions. She was speaking negatively about customers in another language, which is a form of harassment or unprofessional behavior. Even if she didn't know the author could understand, it's still inappropriate to talk that way about customers, especially when they can overhear. The cashier's comment was not only unkind but also discriminatory, assuming the author is Japanese and then suggesting they go back to Japan, which is a racist remark.\n\nThe author's perspective: they've been a regular customer, let it slide before, but now they're aware she's been talking about them. The author isn't looking to fire the cashier but just to stop the behavior. The cashier's actions are unprofessional and could affect customer experience, so the author has a right to report this to the manager. However, the cashier might not have intended the comment to be heard, so the author's reaction is justified given the personal experience of being targeted. The author's intention is to address the behavior without causing harm to the cashier's job, so it's a responsible approach. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
