But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumes they're Japanese. The cashier has been mumbling complaints in Korean during checkouts, and the author didn't say anything before because they thought the cashier was just stressed. But after an incident where the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, the author wants to report her to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, consider the cashier's behavior. She's been making unkind remarks about customers in another language. Even if the author couldn't understand earlier, the recent incident where the cashier specifically targeted the author with a comment about money and their nationality is a clear issue. The cashier's words were offensive and unprofessional, regardless of the language used. The fact that the cashier didn't realize the author is Korean adds a layer of intent\u2014she was talking about the customer in their presence, which is disrespectful.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior but without wanting the cashier to lose her job. They want the manager to address the issue. The key point here is whether the cashier's actions cross the line into harassment or unprofessional conduct. Since the cashier's comments were directed at customers, even if in another language, it's a workplace issue that management should handle. The author is within their rights to report this, especially since they were directly targeted. \n\nThe manager's role includes ensuring a respectful environment for both customers and employees. By reporting, the author isn't just seeking revenge but bringing up a legitimate concern. The cashier's behavior could affect other customers as well. The author's decision not to report in a way that gets the cashier fired shows consideration, but the action itself is justified. \n\nPotential counterpoints: Some might argue that the author overreacted or that the cashier's comments weren't intended for them. However, the cashier's direct comment to the author, including a racial slur (\"Why not go back to Japan\"), is a direct attack, making the report valid. Also, the cashier's previous behavior, though not previously understood by the author, indicates a pattern of unprofessionalism. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. Reporting the behavior to the manager is a responsible action to address harassment and maintain a respectful environment.\n"
