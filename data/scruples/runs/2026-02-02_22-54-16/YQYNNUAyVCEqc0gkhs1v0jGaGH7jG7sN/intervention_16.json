But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is Korean but looks Japanese and has been shopping at a Korean grocery store. The employees, assuming they're Japanese, speak English to them. The cashier has been muttering in Korean, which the person can understand, and now they want to report her because of the offensive comments made during a transaction.\n\nFirst, the cashier was being rude, even if it's in another language. The customer overheard and understood. The cashier's comments were not just stress-related but included personal attacks, like suggesting the customer go back to Japan and implying they're poor. That's pretty harsh, even if it's muttered. The key point is whether the customer is wrong to report this. The cashier was being unprofessional and discriminatory, which is against workplace policies in many places. The customer isn't trying to get her fired but wants her to stop. So the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the behavior. They have a right to a respectful environment. Answer B.\n"
