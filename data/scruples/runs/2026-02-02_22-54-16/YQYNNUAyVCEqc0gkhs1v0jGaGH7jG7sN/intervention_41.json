But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is Korean and fully bilingual, but others mistake them as Japanese due to their appearance. They go to a Korean grocery store weekly, and the employees always speak English to them, assuming they're Japanese. The cashier in question mumbles negative comments in Korean during checkout, which are not highly offensive but are about customers being demanding. The user let it slide before, thinking it might just be job stress. However, the cashier recently mumbled something more direct in Korean after the user pointed out a pricing error. The user is now considering reporting her to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The cashier is using another language to express dissatisfaction, which might be common in some workplaces. Since the employees didn't know the user was Korean, their behavior might not be intentional. The user is bilingual and heard the comment, which could be seen as a mistake on the cashier's part. The cashier's words were harsh, even if in another language, especially since they directly addressed the customer. However, the user's intent is to report the behavior, not to retaliate but to address the issue. The key points are: the cashier's actions were in a different language, perhaps assuming the customer couldn't understand, and the user wants to correct the behavior without causing harm. \n\nIn many cases, using any language to insult customers is unprofessional. The fact that the cashier was caught because the user is bilingual is a coincidence. The user's motivation is to stop the behavior, which is reasonable. The cashier's comments are disrespectful regardless of the language used. The user isn't trying to get the cashier fired but to address the issue. So, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report this. They have a right to feel disrespected and seek a solution. The answer should be B.\n"
