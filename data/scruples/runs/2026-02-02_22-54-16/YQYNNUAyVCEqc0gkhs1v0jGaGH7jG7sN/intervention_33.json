But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but passes as Japanese, so the cashier assumed they were Japanese. The cashier usually mumbles complaints in Korean, which the author noticed but ignored before. Recently, the cashier directly insulted the author, saying things like \"why not go back to Japan\" after a pricing error. Now the author wants to report the cashier without getting them fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, workplace harassment is taken seriously, and even if the comments are in another language, they can still constitute harassment if they target individuals. The cashier's behavior seems to be discriminatory, especially given the racial or ethnic slurs implied. The author has a right to a safe shopping environment without being subjected to such comments.\n\nThe cashier's comments were not just casual complaints but included direct racial targeting. Even if the cashier didn't realize the author was Korean, the slurs like \"go back to Japan\" are inappropriate and cross the line into racial or ethnic discrimination. Reporting this to the manager is a reasonable step to address the harassment without necessarily getting the cashier fired. The author is trying to protect themselves and possibly prevent future incidents.\n\nThe manager is responsible for ensuring that employees treat customers respectfully. The author isn't seeking revenge but wants to stop this behavior. The cashier's actions might have violated company policies, so reporting is appropriate. The fact that the author is bilingual and can understand the slurs adds weight to their position as a victim.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author is in the right to report the cashier's behavior. They are addressing harassment without overstepping, given the potential discrimination involved. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
