But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier.\n\nFirst, the cashier was speaking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier didn't realize the author is Korean, so she thought she was talking in private. The author is bilingual and has been going to the store for a year, leading the employees to assume she's Japanese because she's been spoken to in English. \n\nThe cashier made a rude comment towards the author during a transaction, which the author overheard. Now, the author wants to report this to the manager but doesn't want the cashier to get fired. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is justified in reporting the behavior. The cashier's comments were unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. Even if the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, making derogatory remarks about customers, even in another language, isn't appropriate. The author has the right to a respectful interaction, especially since the cashier's words were directed at her. \n\nThe author isn't trying to get the cashier fired, just to address the issue. So, there's a balance here between holding the employee accountable and considering her job security. The author is in a position where she can bring up the issue without harsh intentions. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She's taking a stand against unprofessional behavior that affected her. The cashier's actions were inappropriate regardless of the language used. The author's intent is to stop the behavior, not to cause harm, so she's justified.\n"
