But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the employees have been assuming he doesn't speak Korean. The cashier has been mumbling complaints in Korean during checkouts, which he could understand but chose to ignore until this incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the cashier's actions are actually inappropriate. She was saying things like customers being demanding or \"making her life hard,\" which the author heard. The key here is whether her comments can be considered harassment or unprofessional behavior. Shit-talking in a foreign language might not be obvious to others, but the author is bilingual and thus a victim. The store's policy probably includes treating all customers with respect, regardless of the language they use. If she's doing this to other customers, even if they can't understand, it's still unprofessional. But the author can understand it, so it's a direct issue for him.\n\nNext, the author's intent. He wants to report her to stop the behavior but doesn't want her fired. That's a reasonable approach; he's not seeking retaliation but to address the problem. However, there's a potential consequence: when the manager finds out the cashier's mistake, he might feel embarrassed or think it's unfair. But the main issue is the cashier's behavior towards customers, which is unprofessional. The manager needs to know to take appropriate action, like reprimanding her or providing training.\n\nAlso, the cashier's recent outburst was in Korean, but the content is about the customer's behavior. The author pointed out a pricing error, leading her to react negatively. Even if the cashier was stressed, her comment was unprofessional and could be seen as rude, regardless of the language. The author has a right to be treated respectfully, especially since he's a paying customer. \n\nAnother angle is the author's identity. Since the employees didn't know he was Korean, maybe they thought they were safe to speak in Korean. However, if they're using their language to complain about customers, even if others can't understand, it's still a problem. The author's decision to reveal his Korean identity to the manager might lead to some tension, but it's a necessary step if he wants the behavior to stop.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the key factors are whether the cashier's actions are genuinely unprofessional and whether the author has a valid reason to report. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and could be against company policies. The author is not overstepping by bringing this to the manager's attention. He's not instigating a problem but seeking resolution for an ongoing issue that's now directly affected him. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier's unprofessional conduct.\n"
