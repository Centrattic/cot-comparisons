But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to report a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in another language. The situation is that the author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The employees have been assuming they're Japanese, hence speaking English. The cashier in question has been mumbling in Korean, which the author can understand, and made a snide comment about them after a pricing error.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the cashier's behavior was appropriate. The cashier was using the language they think the customer doesn't understand to express frustration. Even though it's in Korean, the author is bilingual and can understand it, so it's not really a private conversation. Also, the cashier made a derogatory remark, even if it's not highly offensive. That's unprofessional and could be considered rude or discriminatory, especially since the cashier didn't know the customer's background.\n\nThe author is considering reporting this to the manager but is concerned about the cashier getting fired. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. From a professional standpoint, if an employee is speaking negatively about customers, even in another language, the manager should be informed. It's part of the store's responsibility to ensure employees treat all customers respectfully. The author's intention is to address the behavior, not to cause harm, so even if the cashier doesn't know the customer is Korean, the act of complaining in front of them, regardless of the language, is inappropriate. The author has a right to expect civil treatment, so reporting isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
