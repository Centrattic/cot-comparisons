But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who they believe was talking negatively about customers in another language. The key points here are the cashier's behavior, the author's intent to report, and the potential consequences.\n\nFirst, the cashier was mumbling in Korean, which the author understands because they're bilingual. The cashier made a derogatory comment when the author pointed out a pricing error. The author wants to report this but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job. The store employees think the author is Japanese due to their appearance, so the cashier didn't realize they were being spoken to in Korean.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The cashier's behavior involves disparaging customers, which is unprofessional. The author has the right to address unprofessional conduct, especially since they were directly targeted. However, the author is in a unique position because they can understand the Korean comments. The cashier might not have intended for the author to hear, but the fact that they did, the author has a valid reason to be concerned about the workplace environment and customer treatment.\n\nThe author's intention isn't just to get the cashier fired but to stop the behavior. They\u2019re trying to balance reporting the issue without causing undue harm. The manager should be informed because it's about maintaining a respectful environment. The cashier's actions could affect other customers too, even if the author is the one who understood it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They\u2019re addressing a legitimate issue. The cashier's behavior is the main problem here. The author is taking responsibility to report it, which is the right thing to do. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
