But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is Korean but looks Japanese, lives in a Japanese-populated area, and goes to a Korean grocery store weekly. The cashier assumes they're Japanese because she's speaking English to them. \n\nThe cashier has been mumbled complaints in Korean during checkouts, which the person noticed because they're bilingual. The person tried to be understanding, thinking maybe the job is stressful. But then, after a pricing error, the cashier made a harsh comment in Korean, which the person understood. The comment was rude and included a suggestion to \"go back to Japan,\" implying they don't belong.\n\nThe person wants to report this to the manager to stop the behavior but doesn't want the cashier fired. They're worried about the employees finding out they're Korean. \n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. \n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional. Even if she didn't know the customer was Korean, making derogatory remarks, especially implying racial slurs or suggesting they leave their own country, is inappropriate. The fact that she did this in Korean might be an assumption that others can't understand, but the customer did understand. \n\nThe customer has a right to be treated with respect. By reporting the behavior without intent to get her fired, they're addressing harassment. Employers typically have policies against such conduct. The person isn't taking it lightly but has a valid reason to want the behavior stopped. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the cashier didn't know the customer's identity, so the comment wasn't targeted. However, the comment itself is racially charged and would be offensive regardless. The person's decision to report is about stopping harassment, not revenge. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
