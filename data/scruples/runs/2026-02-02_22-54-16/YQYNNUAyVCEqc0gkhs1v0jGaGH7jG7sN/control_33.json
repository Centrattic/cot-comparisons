But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is at fault for reporting the cashier. The person is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier and employees assume they're Japanese. The cashier mumbles in Korean, which the user understands, and made a derogatory comment about saving 50 cents and going back to Japan. The user wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user is in the wrong. The cashier's behavior includes making offensive comments, even if it's in another language. The user is bilingual and has been a regular customer. The cashier didn't know the user was Korean, so the comment was based on a mistaken identity. The user is concerned about the cashier's behavior, which could be considered harassment or unprofessional. \n\nThe user wants to report the cashier to the manager, which is a reasonable step if the comments were directed at them and were offensive. The cashier's behavior could be violating workplace conduct policies. The user is trying to address the issue without causing the cashier to lose her job, which is a considerate approach. \n\nHowever, the user might be overstepping if the cashier's comments weren't meant for them. But since the cashier directed the comment at the user, even if in another language, the user has a right to address it. The user isn't spreading rumors but reporting what was said directly. They are advocating for their dignity. \n\nThe cashier's behavior could be seen as unprofessional and discriminatory. The user isn't at fault for wanting to report it. They are in a position where they can understand the comments, which others might not, so they might feel responsible to speak up. The user's intent is to stop the behavior, not to take revenge. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a legitimate reason to report the cashier's offensive remarks and are doing so responsibly by involving the manager.\n"
