But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author overheard because they're bilingual. The cashier thought the author was Japanese, so she spoke in Korean, which the author understands. The cashier made a derogatory comment after a pricing error. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The cashier was doing her job but making negative comments about customers. That's unprofessional behavior. The author, being bilingual, can understand the comments, which were not just casual chat but actually derogatory towards customers. The cashier's comment here was offensive, implying the customer was cheap and maybe even suggesting they go back to Japan, which could be considered a racial slur or at least a very rude remark. \n\nThe author's action is to report this behavior. The store's policy probably prohibits employees from harassing or disrespecting customers, even if it's in another language. The fact that the cashier thought the customer couldn't understand doesn't make it right. The author has a right to a respectful service environment. \n\nHowever, the author might be concerned about the cashier's job security because she didn't know the author was Korean. But the cashier's behavior affected the customer experience. The author isn't trying to get her fired, just to stop the behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes people might argue that the cashier is just venting in her own language, but that's not acceptable when it's directed at customers. The manager should be aware and handle it appropriately. The author's intent is to improve their shopping experience without harming the cashier's job, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
