But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the scenario is that the author is Korean-American, but since they look Japanese and the store is in a Japanese area, the employees assume they're Japanese. The cashier has been mumbling negative comments in Korean about customers during checkout. The author usually ignores it, thinking maybe the job is stressful. But one time, when the author points out a pricing error, the cashier mumbles in Korean, and the author, being bilingual, understands she's saying something derogatory about them and even telling them to go back to Japan.\n\nThe author wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her to get fired. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the elements of the situation. The cashier is using another language to make negative remarks about customers, which the author can understand. The cashier is being rude, possibly discriminatory, especially with the comment about going back to Japan. The author has a right to be treated with respect, regardless of the language used. Even if the cashier thinks the customer isn't Korean, the behavior is still unprofessional and potentially harassing. \n\nThe author is in a position to understand the comments and is experiencing direct discrimination. Reporting it to the manager is a reasonable step to address the behavior without necessarily getting the cashier fired. The manager should handle it appropriately, maybe through training or disciplinary action. The author isn't overstepping by seeking to stop the harassment. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are the cashier's unprofessional conduct, the author's right to be respected, and the appropriate action to report it without malice.\n"
