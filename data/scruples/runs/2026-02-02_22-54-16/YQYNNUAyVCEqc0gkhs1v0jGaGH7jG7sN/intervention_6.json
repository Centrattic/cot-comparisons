But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The cashier was talking about customers in Korean, which the author understood. The cashier specifically insulted the author after a pricing issue, and the author is bilingual but was mistaken for Japanese. The author is considering reporting the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She was mumbled complaints in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier made a rude comment about the author, even though she didn't know the author was Korean. The author is in a position where they can understand the cashier's remarks, which others might not. \n\nThe cashier's behavior could be considered unprofessional. Even if it's in another language, if a customer can understand and it's derogatory, that's a problem. However, the cashier might not have intended to target the author specifically, as she didn't know the author's identity. But the recent incident shows she did target the author after the pricing issue. \n\nThe author wants to report the cashier to the manager to stop the behavior but not get her fired. That's a reasonable approach because the author is trying to address the issue without overreacting. The author is in a unique position to bring this up since they can understand the remarks others might not. \n\nOn the other hand, the cashier might be under stress, and the author had given her the benefit of the doubt before. However, the cashier's comment was offensive, and the author has the right to report unprofessional behavior. The manager should be informed to handle it appropriately. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. They're taking a responsible step to address harassment or unprofessional conduct they experienced. The answer should be B (No).\n"
