But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this story is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier assumed they were Japanese, hence spoke English. The cashier used Korean to complain about customers, which the author overheard because they understand Korean. The cashier made a derogatory comment towards the author, who then wants to report her without getting her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The cashier was disrespectful, using a language the author understands. Even though they didn't know the author is Korean, the cashier's behavior was inappropriate. The author wants to report this to the manager but is concerned about the cashier losing her job. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the cashier's behavior was unprofessional and discriminatory. The author has the right to report harassment or disrespectful treatment. However, the cashier might not have known the author's identity, so maybe she thought the comments wouldn't be heard. The key points are whether the author's action is justified given the situation. The author is trying to address the misconduct without causing harm, which seems reasonable. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
