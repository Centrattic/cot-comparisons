But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier assumed they were Japanese, so they spoke English. The cashier mumbled complaints in Korean, which the author overheard because they're bilingual. Then there was an incident where the cashier made a derogatory comment after a pricing error. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The cashier was talking negatively about customers, which could be considered unprofessional. The author had a specific example where the cashier made a racial comment. Even though the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, the author could understand the Korean comments. The question is whether reporting this is the right thing to do.\n\nThe author isn't looking to get the cashier fired but wants her to stop the behavior. The store manager should be informed about the inappropriate comments. However, the cashier might not have realized the author could understand. Workplaces typically have policies against harassment, so reporting it is reasonable. The author isn't spreading false information; they have a legitimate concern. The cashier's comments were unprofessional and could create a hostile environment. Even if the cashier didn't intend to target the author specifically, her behavior is still problematic. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report it to ensure a respectful environment. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
