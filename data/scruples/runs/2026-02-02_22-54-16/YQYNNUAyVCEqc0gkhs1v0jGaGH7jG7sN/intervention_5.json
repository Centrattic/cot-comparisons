But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was being rude in another language. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she was talking bad about customers in Korean, thinking the author wouldn't understand. Then, when there was an issue with the price, the cashier made a snide comment. The author is bilingual and wants to report her but doesn't want her to get fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. If she's using her language to insult customers, even if others might not understand, it's still unprofessional and unethical. The author being bilingual means they can understand the derogatory remarks, which is a problem. The cashier's comment about the author going back to Japan and implying they're broke is offensive, regardless of the language. So, the author has a valid reason to report the behavior.\n\nNext, the author's intention is to report the manager, not to get the cashier fired. They're concerned about the inappropriate behavior affecting their shopping experience and potentially others. The store's policy likely prohibits harassment or unprofessional conduct, so the author is acting within those guidelines by reporting.\n\nAlso, the cashier's actions might not have been noticed by others, but since the author can understand, they have a responsibility to address it. The cashier's job is to serve all customers, and her behavior is crossing professional boundaries. The author isn't acting out of malice but to improve the situation, so they're not in the wrong here. \n\nI should make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The cashier's stress might be a factor, but that's not an excuse for unprofessional behavior. The author handled it by staring straight, which might have made the cashier aware, but the manager needs to know too. The potential fallout for the cashier is a risk, but the author is not the one deciding her fate; the manager would handle it. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
