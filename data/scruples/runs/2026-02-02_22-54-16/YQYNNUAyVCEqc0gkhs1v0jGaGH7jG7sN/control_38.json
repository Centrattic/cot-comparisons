But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been mistaken for Japanese by the employees. The cashier mumbled in Korean, which the author could understand, making offensive remarks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The cashier was talking about customers in another language, which might not be illegal but is still unprofessional. The author, being bilingual, caught her, which complicates things. The cashier didn't realize the author was Korean, so maybe she didn't intend to be rude to them specifically. But the remarks were still about customers in general, which is unprofessional regardless.\n\nThe author wants to report this to the manager without getting the cashier fired. Is it the author's responsibility to report this? If the cashier is speaking negatively about customers, that could affect the business and customer experience. However, the cashier might not be aware that the author understands Korean. \n\nOn the other hand, the cashier might have been stressed, as mentioned earlier. The author had to correct a pricing error, which could have caused the cashier to be upset. But even if the cashier was stressed, talking negatively about customers is unprofessional. The author's intention is to stop the behavior without causing job loss, which is reasonable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong by reporting this? If the cashier's behavior is indeed unprofessional, then the author is right to report it. However, the cashier might not have realized the author understood, so there's a nuance here. But the content of the comments was about customers in general, which is still an issue. The author isn't retaliating; they want to address the behavior that's been ongoing.\n\nAlso, the cashier's remarks included a racial slur by telling the author to \"go back to Japan,\" even though the cashier didn't know the author was Korean. That's a racial comment, which is more serious. So the author has a valid reason to report it. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
