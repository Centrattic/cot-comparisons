But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The situation is that the cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author overheard because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, assuming they were Japanese. The author wants to report this behavior but doesn't want the cashier to get fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She was mumbled negative comments about customers in another language, which is unprofessional. Even if she didn't know the author understood Korean, it's still inappropriate for an employee to speak negatively about customers. The author caught her in the act, so they have a valid reason to be concerned about this behavior.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior to the manager, not to get the cashier fired but to stop the negative talk. The cashier's comments were not highly offensive but more about stress and complaining. However, even casual remarks can create a poor work environment and reflect poorly on the business.\n\nThe author is in a position where they can act because they have the language skills to understand the complaints. They didn't confront the cashier directly but want to address the issue through the manager. This approach is reasonable to maintain professionalism and ensure the cashier stops the behavior without immediate retaliation.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier might not have realized the author's identity, so the author's report could lead to surprises. But the author's primary concern is the cashier's unprofessional conduct, which is legitimate. The author isn't acting out of malice but to correct inappropriate behavior. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
