But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier didn't realize that. The cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, which the author understood. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The cashier was making negative remarks about customers, which is unprofessional. Even if it's in another language, it's still part of her job interactions. The store should maintain a respectful environment for all customers. The author has a right to feel disrespected, especially since they could understand the comments.\n\nBut the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so maybe she thought no one else could understand. However, that doesn't excuse the behavior. The author is bilingual and had to hear something offensive. Reporting it isn't just about the author's feelings; it's about ensuring other customers aren't subjected to similar comments. The manager should be informed because it's a workplace conduct issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about the cashier losing her job. The author wants to address the issue without causing harm. The cashier might not have realized the impact of her words. So, reporting it to the manager for a warning or training might be appropriate. The author's intention is to stop the behavior, not necessarily to get her fired. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If someone is being mistreated or disrespected, they have the right to report it. The cashier's actions were unprofessional and unacceptable. The author isn't spreading rumors; they have a specific incident to report. The manager needs to know to handle it properly. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the behavior. The answer should be B (No).\n"
