But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is at fault for wanting to report a cashier. The cashier has been mumbling in Korean about customers, and the user, who is Korean but mistaken for Japanese, recently experienced this and now wants to address it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The cashier is speaking negatively about customers in another language, which the user understands. The user tried to ignore it before, but this time the cashier made a comment that's offensive when translated. The user is bilingual, so they can hear and understand the Korean slurs. The main question is whether the user is in the wrong for reporting this.\n\nSo, the cashier's actions: she's making derogatory remarks. Even if they're not in the customer's language, if the customer can understand them, it's a valid reason to be upset. The user isn't trying to cause trouble; they just want the behavior to stop. Also, the cashier's actions might be affecting the store's reputation and employee relations. The user is concerned about the cashier's job, so they want to report but not get her fired. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the cashier is clearly in the wrong for speaking negatively about customers. However, the user's decision to report is a bit tricky. Since the cashier didn't know the user was Korean, the user might have a right to point out the behavior, especially since they can understand. The user is taking responsibility and wants to address a problem that exists. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user is overstepping by reporting someone else's behavior. However, in a professional setting, employees are expected to maintain a respectful environment. If the cashier is speaking negatively in a way that's audible to customers, even if they didn't intend for the customer to hear, it's a workplace issue. The user is a customer who is affected, so they might have a right to bring it up to the manager for resolution. \n\nThe user's main concern is that the cashier might get fired, so they want to avoid that. But the manager should handle it appropriately, perhaps through counseling or training. The user isn't demanding immediate termination, just that the behavior stops. \n\nIs there a culture of such behavior in the store? The user mentions that employees might react if they find out. But the cashier specifically targeted the user here. The user has a right to be treated with respect, regardless of the cashier's assumption about their ethnicity. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to report. The cashier's actions are unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, especially if the comments are about the user's background. The user is protecting their own experience and the store's environment. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
