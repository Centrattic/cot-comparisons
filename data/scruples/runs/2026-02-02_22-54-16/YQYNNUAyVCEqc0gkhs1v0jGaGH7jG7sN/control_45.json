But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to report a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in another language. The key points here are the cashier's behavior, the author's identity, and the potential consequences.\n\nFirst, the cashier mumbled in Korean, which the author understands. The cashier's comments were about customers being demanding or making her job hard. The incident escalated when the cashier made a personal attack after a pricing error. The author is Korean but was mistaken for Japanese, leading the cashier to speak English to her. \n\nNow, the author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The cashier's behavior involves speaking negatively to customers, which can be considered unprofessional or even harassment. However, the cashier might not be aware that the author understands Korean. The author, by reporting, is addressing a problem that's affecting her experience, especially after a direct insult. \n\nOn the other hand, the cashier might have a valid reason for stress, but using derogatory remarks towards customers is not acceptable. The author's intent is to stop the behavior without causing job loss, which shows consideration. \n\nSo, considering the cashier's unprofessional conduct and the author's right to a respectful environment, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
