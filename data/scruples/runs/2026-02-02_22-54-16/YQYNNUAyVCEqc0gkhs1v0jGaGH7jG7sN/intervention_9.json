But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she mumbled in Korean, which the author could understand. The key points here are the cashier's behavior, the author's intention to report it, and the possible consequences.\n\nFirst, the cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could hear. The cashier didn't know the author understood Korean, so she thought she was being discreet. But the author is bilingual and overheard her. The cashier's comments were not highly offensive but were derogatory towards customers, implying they were cheap or problematic. The author wants to report her to the manager but doesn't want her fired, just to stop the behavior.\n\nNow, considering workplace behavior, employees should treat all customers respectfully. Even if the cashier thought she was being private, using negative language about customers in a workplace setting is unprofessional. The author has a right to be treated with respect, regardless of language. The cashier's comments could be considered harassment or unprofessional conduct.\n\nThe author's intention is to address the issue without causing harm to the cashier's job, which is reasonable. Reporting the issue isn't about getting someone fired but ensuring a respectful environment. Since the cashier's actions were unprofessional and the author has evidence (hearing the comments in Korean), the author is justified in reporting it. The manager is responsible for maintaining a respectful workplace, so informing them is appropriate.\n\nThe author's concern about the cashier finding out they're Korean adds another layer, but that doesn't negate the right to report unprofessional behavior. The author's actions are about seeking resolution, not malice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
