But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumed they were Japanese. The cashier mumbled in Korean during checkout, which the author overheard because they're bilingual. The cashier even made a comment about the author being cheap and maybe going back to Japan.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author has a valid reason to report. The cashier was talking negatively about customers, which is unprofessional. Even if it's in another language, it's still inappropriate behavior. The author isn't just making it up; they understood the comments because of their bilingualism. The cashier's behavior was directed at customers, which could be considered harassment or a hostile work environment.\n\nThe cashier's comments about the author being Japanese and the slur about going back to Japan is also a potential issue. That's a racial or ethnic remark, which is definitely not okay. The author has the right to feel disrespected and unsafe. Reporting this to the manager is a reasonable step to address the behavior without necessarily getting the cashier fired. The author is concerned about the cashier's job, which shows they're not out to get her but want to stop the behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier might not have realized the author understood Korean, or they thought they were being discreet. However, the cashier should be aware that customers might understand different languages, especially in a multicultural area. The manager should handle employee conduct, regardless of the language used. The author isn't causing trouble without cause; they're addressing harassment. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a legitimate reason to report the behavior to protect themselves and others from unprofessional and possibly offensive remarks. The answer should be B (No).\n"
