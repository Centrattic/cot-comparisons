But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but is mistaken for Japanese because of their appearance. The cashier, thinking the customer is Japanese, mumbled complaints in Korean. Then, when a price discrepancy was pointed out, the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, which the author understood due to being bilingual.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the cashier's behavior was inappropriate. The cashier was giving negative comments about customers in another language. Even if it's in Korean, if the employer has a policy against that, then the cashier is violating it. The author caught the cashier in the act of making a derogatory remark, which is offensive. \n\nThe author's intent is to report the behavior without wanting the cashier to lose her job. The author is trying to address a problem without being vindictive. The cashier's comments were directed at the customer, which is unprofessional. Even if others might not hear it, the cashier's behavior is still a workplace issue. \n\nThe author is in a position where they can report the incident because they understand the language. They have a right to be treated professionally. The cashier's actions could create a hostile work environment, which the manager should address. The author isn't trying to ruin the cashier's life but to stop the harassment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The cashier's behavior is the issue here. The author is taking appropriate steps to report unprofessional and offensive conduct. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
