But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author is Korean, bilingual but looks Japanese and is assumed to be Japanese by the store employees. The cashier, who is Korean, often complains about customers in Korean, which the author didn't notice until a recent incident where the cashier made a derogatory comment towards the author. Now, the author wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The cashier was using Korean to complain about customers, which the author didn't understand until the incident. The cashier's comments were not just complaints but included offensive remarks. The author, being a customer, has a right to feel respected. The cashier's behavior could be considered unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, especially since the cashier was mocking the customer based on perceived nationality and financial status.\n\nThe author isn't looking to get the cashier fired but wants the behavior to stop. Since the cashier's comments are made in a language the customer couldn't understand, it's possible that others in the store (including other employees) might not be aware of the behavior. Reporting it to the manager is a reasonable step to address the issue, as the manager is responsible for employee conduct.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't confront the cashier directly, which might be seen as a way to avoid a confrontation. However, since the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and could affect other customers, it's part of the store's responsibility to maintain a respectful environment. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to bring this to the manager's attention to ensure the cashier stops the behavior.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the cashier being unaware that the customer is Korean. The author could have revealed their identity earlier, but since the cashier was speaking Korean out of sight, it's understandable that the author didn't. The cashier's actions are still inappropriate regardless of the customer's actual identity.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author is justified in reporting the cashier to the manager to address the unprofessional conduct without the intent to fire the employee. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
