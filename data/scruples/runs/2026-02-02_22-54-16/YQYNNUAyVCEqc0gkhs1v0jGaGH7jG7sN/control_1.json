But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation (the author) is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language.\n\nFirst, the cashier was using Korean to complain about customers, which the author could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't realize the author was Korean, so she thought she was being discreet. The key points here are that the cashier was making derogatory remarks about customers (like saying they're broke or should go back to Japan) in a language she assumed the customers wouldn't understand. \n\nThe author is concerned about the cashier's behavior and wants to report it but doesn't want her fired. The main issue is whether the author is justified in reporting this. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the cashier was making offensive remarks in a language the customer could understand, even if it was under their breath, that could be considered harassment or a hostile work environment, depending on the company's policies. Employers usually have rules against such behavior. The author's intent is to address the behavior, not to get the cashier fired, so they're trying to balance reporting the issue without being vindictive.\n\nThe cashier's actions were inappropriate regardless of the language used. The fact that she didn't know the author was Korean doesn't make her comments acceptable. The author is in a position to address this because they can understand the remarks. Reporting the behavior to the manager is a reasonable step to ensure the workplace environment is respectful for all customers.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is overstepping by reporting a coworker, especially if the manager doesn't speak Korean and might not believe the author's account. But given that the author is bilingual and the cashier made the remarks in front of them, it's a valid concern. The author isn't fabricating something; they have direct evidence of the behavior.\n\nThe cashier's comments about someone going back to Japan also touch on potential discrimination or xenophobia, which is a serious issue. Even if the cashier didn't mean it to be heard, saying such things, even in another language, is unprofessional. The author's desire to report this isn't just about personal discomfort but about addressing inappropriate behavior that could be offensive to customers.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to ensure the cashier stops this behavior. They're trying to resolve the issue respectfully by reporting it to the manager rather than confronting the cashier directly, which could lead to tension. The author's intention to prevent the cashier from being fired shows consideration, which is positive.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is that the author is not in the wrong. The cashier's behavior was unprofessional and offensive, and the author is taking a responsible step to address it without malicious intent.\n"
