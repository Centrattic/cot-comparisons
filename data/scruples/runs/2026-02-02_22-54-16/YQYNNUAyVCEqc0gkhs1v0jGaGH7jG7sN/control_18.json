But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The cashier assumes they're Japanese because they speak English and the cashier uses Korean to talk to other customers. The cashier has been muttering negative things in Korean towards customers, which the author didn't confront before because they thought maybe the job was stressful. But now, after the cashier made a derogatory comment towards the author (who they didn't know was Korean), the author wants to report her to the manager but doesn't want her fired. \n\nSo the main points here: The cashier was disrespectful, making negative comments in another language, which the author understood. The author is bilingual and the cashier didn't know their true identity. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting this behavior.\n\nThe cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional and possibly discriminatory. The author is in a position to understand the comments because of their bilingualism, so they have a right to address it. The author is concerned about the cashier's job, so they don't want to cause her harm, but the behavior is still inappropriate. \n\nIn many workplaces, employees are expected to maintain professional conduct, and making derogatory remarks about customers, even in another language, is not acceptable. The author is reporting the behavior to the manager, which is a responsible step. Since the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, the comment might have been based on stereotypes or assumptions, which is also problematic. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. They are seeking to address unprofessional behavior without necessarily wanting the cashier to lose her job. So the answer should be B.\n"
