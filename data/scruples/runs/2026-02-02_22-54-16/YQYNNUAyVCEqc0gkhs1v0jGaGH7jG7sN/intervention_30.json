But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. \n\nFirst, the author is a Korean person who is bilingual but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumed they were Japanese. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier specifically insulted the author after a pricing issue, telling them to go back to Japan and implying they were cheap.\n\nThe author wants to report this to the manager but doesn't want the cashier to get fired. They\u2019re concerned about the cashier finding out they\u2019re actually Korean.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Well, the cashier was making negative remarks towards customers, which is unprofessional. The author has the right to report harassment or discrimination, especially since they were directly targeted. The fact that the cashier didn't know the author's true identity doesn't negate the offensive behavior. \n\nHowever, the author is in a position where they could have confronted the cashier directly, but they chose to report instead. Since the cashier's behavior was inappropriate and the author felt targeted, reporting it to management is a reasonable step to prevent future incidents. The manager should address the cashier's conduct regardless of the author's ethnicity. The author isn't trying to get the cashier fired immediately, just to stop the behavior. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They\u2019re standing up against harassment. The answer should be B.\n"
