But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was being rude in Korean, which the author, being Korean bilingual, understood. The cashier didn't realize the customer was Korean, so she spoke in Korean, thinking the customer wouldn't understand. The cashier's comments were negative about customers in general, but the author specifically faced a situation where the cashier made a derogatory comment after a pricing error.\n\nFirst, the cashier was being unprofessional. Even if she was venting to another employee, making derogatory remarks about customers in another language (assuming the customer doesn't understand) is still inappropriate. The manager should be aware of such behavior if reported. The author didn't confront her directly on the spot, maybe to avoid conflict, but instead wants to report it but not get her fired. That shows consideration for the employee's job, which is a good point.\n\nBut why does the cashier think like that? Maybe she's stressed, but that's not an excuse for unprofessional conduct. The author's main issue is that the cashier's behavior is disrespectful and needs to be addressed. The fact that the cashier spoke in Korean, thinking the customer wouldn't understand, adds a layer because she might be hiding her comments under the assumption of the customer's language barrier. \n\nThe author is in a Korean grocery store, so employees are expected to be professional with all customers, regardless of their perceived nationality. The cashier's actions could lead to a hostile work environment for other employees who might be Korean but not bilingual, or be targeted by her remarks. Also, the author's identity being a surprise (since they look Japanese) might make others uncomfortable if they find out, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is justified in reporting the cashier. Since the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and the author is directly affected, the author has a right to report it. The author's intention isn't to harm the cashier's job but to stop the negative behavior. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
