But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier, who doesn't know the author is Korean, has been talking negatively about customers in Korean, and when the author corrected a price error, the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, which the author overheard because they're bilingual.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is bilingual and has been going to the store for a year, leading the employees to assume they're Japanese. The cashier has been mumbling complaints in Korean about customers, which the author initially ignored, thinking it's due to job stress. However, after an incident where the cashier made a negative comment directed at the author, the author is now considering reporting her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is justified in reporting the cashier. The cashier's behavior involves speaking negatively about customers in another language, which could be considered unprofessional or rude. The author is concerned about the cashier's behavior but also wants to avoid causing her to lose her job. \n\nI need to evaluate if the cashier's actions are a valid reason to report her. Since the cashier is speaking to the customer in a language they don't know, but in this case, the author can understand, it might be considered inappropriate for an employee to speak negatively about a customer, regardless of the language. However, the cashier might not realize that the author understands Korean, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's intention is to address the behavior without getting the cashier fired. The question is whether the author is at fault for wanting to report this. The cashier's comment was rude and targeted, which is unprofessional. The author is seeking to correct a wrong without causing undue harm to the cashier. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional, and the author has the right to report it. The author is considering a responsible approach by wanting to inform the manager without causing immediate harm. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The answer should be B (No).\n"
