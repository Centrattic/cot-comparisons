But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. So, the situation is that the author is Korean but is mistaken as Japanese by the employees. The cashier often mumbles in Korean about customers, and the author heard her specifically talking negatively in a situation where the author pointed out a price error.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier was speaking another language (Korean) and the author could understand it. The cashier's comments were negative towards customers, even if not highly offensive. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired because they don't want to cause trouble if the employees find out the author is actually Korean.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting. On one hand, the cashier was using derogatory language about customers, which is unprofessional. The author has the right to report harassment or discrimination. On the other hand, the cashier might not be aware that the author could understand her, and the author might be taking advantage of a misunderstanding. However, the cashier's behavior was directed at customers in general, not specifically at the author, but in this case, it was the author who heard it. \n\nAlso, the cashier did make a racial comment (\"go back to Japan\") which is definitely offensive. Even if the cashier didn't know the author was Korean, that comment is problematic. The author is trying to address a behavior that's inappropriate, so reporting it isn't wrong. The author's intent is to stop the behavior without wanting the cashier to lose her job, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, considering that the cashier's comments are unprofessional and the author has a valid reason to bring it up with management, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
