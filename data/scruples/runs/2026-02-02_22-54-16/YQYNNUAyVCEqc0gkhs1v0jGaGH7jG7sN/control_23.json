But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier, who is Korean, has been mumbling in Korean during checkout, which the author knows is actually a way of shit-talking customers. The author is also Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier never spoke to them in Korean and thus didn't realize they understand it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the cashier's behavior is genuinely inappropriate. Shit-talking customers in another language might be seen as unprofessional. Even though the cashier might not think the customers understand, it's still disrespectful to talk negatively about customers, regardless of the language. However, the cashier's comments are about the customers being demanding or implying they're broke, which isn't highly offensive but still rude.\n\nNext, the author is bilingual and understood the cashier's remarks. They felt that the cashier's words were hurtful and unprofessional, especially after the cashier made a mistake with the price. The author wants to report the cashier to the manager but is concerned about her getting fired. The store only has two registers, so the author will likely encounter the cashier again, which they find uncomfortable now.\n\nConsidering the author's intent: they want the cashier to stop the behavior but not have her fired. Reporting the incident to the manager is a reasonable step because the cashier is talking negatively about customers, which affects the store's image and customer experience. The manager should be aware and address it. The cashier's job is to serve customers, and if she's disrespected them in their own language, it's a breach of customer service standards.\n\nBut wait, the cashier might have thought the customers didn't understand Korean. If the author is in the wrong, maybe because they were hiding their identity, but they didn't deceive anyone. The cashier assumed the customer was Japanese based on appearance and spoke in English, which is standard if they think the customer doesn't speak Korean. The author didn't correct the assumption, so maybe the cashier isn't at fault for not knowing? However, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional regardless of the customer's background. The manager should address the language used towards customers in general, not just this specific instance.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong for wanting to report something they heard and felt was inappropriate. The cashier's actions are unprofessional, and the author is taking responsibility to address it. The author's intention isn't to get the cashier fired but to stop the behavior, which is a valid concern. The cashier should be held accountable for her unprofessional conduct, and the manager needs to know to possibly provide training or a warning.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to report the cashier's unprofessional behavior, and their approach seems measured (just wanting to stop the behavior, not immediate termination). The cashier's actions are inappropriate regardless of the customer's identity, so it's reasonable for the author to bring it up.\n"
