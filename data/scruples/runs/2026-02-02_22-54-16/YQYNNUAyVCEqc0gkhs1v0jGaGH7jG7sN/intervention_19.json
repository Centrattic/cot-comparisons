But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in another language. The key points here are that the author is Korean but looked Japanese, so the employees didn't realize that. The cashier was mumbling in Korean, which the author could understand, and made a derogatory comment after a pricing error incident.\n\nFirst, the cashier was making negative remarks about customers in a language they thought the customers didn't understand. Since the author can understand Korean, the cashier's comments were actually directed at them, even if the cashier didn't know. The comment was offensive and included a racial slur (\"Why not go back to Japan...\"), which is clearly inappropriate.\n\nThe author is considering reporting the cashier to the manager but is concerned about the cashier losing her job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking that action. The main factors here are the cashier's behavior being unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, the author's right to a respectful service, and the potential consequences for the cashier.\n\nThe cashier's actions could be considered harassment or discrimination, especially the racial comment. The author has the right to report such behavior, especially if they are a customer. However, the author is also trying to balance this by not wanting the cashier to lose her job, which shows consideration. \n\nThere's no indication that the author is exaggerating the situation. The cashier's behavior was consistent and included a direct insult. The author's intent is to address the behavior without causing unnecessary harm, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, based on this, the author is not in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The cashier's actions were inappropriate, and the author is within their rights to seek resolution. The answer is B.\n"
