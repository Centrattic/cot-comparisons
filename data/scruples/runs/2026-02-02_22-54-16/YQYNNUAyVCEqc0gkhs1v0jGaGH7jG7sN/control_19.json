But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was being rude in another language. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The cashier assumes the author is Japanese, so she speaks English to them. The cashier often complains about customers in Korean, which the author can understand. Recently, the cashier made a derogatory comment towards the author when a pricing error occurred. The author wants to report this behavior but doesn't want the cashier to get fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She was being disrespectful, even if it was in Korean. The author, being bilingual, understood the insult. The cashier's comment was offensive and inappropriate, regardless of the language used. Employers usually have policies against harassment or unprofessional behavior, so reporting it might be justified.\n\nThe author's intent is to address the behavior without causing the cashier to lose her job. The cashier might not realize the author understands Korean, so the comment was directed at the author without knowing. The author is in a situation where they might encounter the cashier frequently, which adds to the discomfort.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for reporting? Probably not. They are addressing harassment. The cashier's actions were unprofessional, and the author has a right to a respectful environment. However, the author is also considering the cashier's job security, which shows they're not trying to be malicious. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. If the cashier's comments were in Korean, assuming customers don't understand, could that be part of the issue? However, the author is a customer and has a right to be treated with respect. The cashier's behavior crosses a line when it becomes personal and derogatory.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the behavior. The cashier's actions were inappropriate, and the author is seeking a resolution without being vindictive. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
