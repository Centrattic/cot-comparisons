But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in Korean. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, and the author is bilingual. The situation is that the cashier said some things about the author after they pointed out a pricing error. The author wants to tell the manager but doesn't want the cashier to get fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She was mumble-ranting in Korean, which the customers presumably couldn't understand. But when the author, who is Korean and in a Japanese-populated area, pointed out the price mistake, she made a comment in Korean. The author heard it and was upset. The cashier's words were unkind and possibly rude, but they were in a different language initially. However, the author is bilingual and understood it after the cashier said it in front of them. \n\nThe cashier's comment about the customer being \"broke\" and suggesting they go back to Japan is definitely inappropriate. Even if she didn't realize the author was Korean, the content of the comment is offensive. The author is in a position where they can understand the cashier's remarks, which the cashier assumed others couldn't. \n\nNow, the author's intention is to report the behavior but not want the cashier fired. The question is if the author is in the wrong for reporting. The cashier was using a language that the author could understand, even though the cashier thought the author wasn't Korean. The author had a right to be in the store and to point out the mistake. The cashier's response was unprofessional and could be considered harassment or discrimination. \n\nThe author is choosing to address the issue, which is reasonable because the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and potentially harmful. The fact that the author is bilingual and could now understand the comments might be a reason to speak up. Reporting to the manager without wanting the cashier to lose her job is about addressing the problem rather than punishing. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The cashier's actions were unacceptable, and the author has a right to ask for it to stop. The fact that the cashier didn't know the author's identity doesn't excuse her behavior. The author is justified in wanting to report the cashier to the manager to address the issue professionally.\n"
