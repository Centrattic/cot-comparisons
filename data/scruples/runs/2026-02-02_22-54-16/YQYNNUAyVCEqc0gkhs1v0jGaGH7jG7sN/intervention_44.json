But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The scenario is about a Korean person who is bilingual but looks Japanese. They go to a Korean grocery store where the cashier, thinking they're Japanese, mumbles negative things in Korean. The cashier even said some rude things after the customer corrected a pricing error. The customer wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The customer didn't want to confront the cashier before, maybe thinking it's job stress. Now, after the cashier's comment, they want to report her. The key points here are harassment and discrimination. The cashier is making negative comments in another language, which could be considered discriminatory or hostile work environment if it's directed at customers based on their perceived ethnicity. Even though the cashier didn't know the customer was Korean, the comments were directed at customers who are not Korean, which might be a form of stereotyping or bias.\n\nThe store's policy on harassment would matter here. If the cashier is creating a hostile environment for customers, the store has a responsibility to address it. However, the customer is in a position where they were initially mistaken as Japanese, so the cashier might not have intended to target them specifically. But the customer's experience is valid, and the cashier's behavior is inappropriate regardless of the target.\n\nThe customer wants to report but doesn't want the cashier fired. That's a reasonable approach, maybe seeking a warning or training instead. The customer isn't seeking revenge but wants the behavior to stop. The cashier's actions could be considered a breach of professional conduct, so reporting is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier might have been under stress, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The customer isn't in the wrong for taking steps to address harassment. The answer is likely B (No) because the customer is reporting inappropriate behavior without intent to harm the cashier's job, and the behavior is unprofessional regardless of the cashier's intent.\n"
