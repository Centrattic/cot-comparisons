But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she mumbled in Korean, thinking the customer couldn't understand. Then, when there was a pricing issue, the cashier made a comment that the author overheard in Korean. The author is bilingual but was mistaken for Japanese due to appearance. Now, the author is considering reporting the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The cashier was being rude, even if it was in another language. The fact that the cashier didn't realize the customer could understand might be a factor. But the author is within their rights to address harassment or inappropriate behavior. \n\nThe cashier's comments, even if not directly at the author, could be considered unprofessional. The author wants to report her, but not get her fired. The key points here are the cashier's behavior and the author's right to take action. \n\nIn most workplaces, employees are expected to maintain a professional demeanor around customers. The cashier's behavior could be seen as unprofessional and potentially harmful to customer relations. The author, being able to understand the language, is in a position to bring this up. The manager would need to address it, which might involve retraining, not necessarily termination if it's a one-time incident. \n\nThere's no indication the author is exaggerating. The cashier's comment was offensive and targeted. The author's intention is to stop the behavior without causing harm. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report this. The cashier is the one at fault for unprofessional conduct. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
