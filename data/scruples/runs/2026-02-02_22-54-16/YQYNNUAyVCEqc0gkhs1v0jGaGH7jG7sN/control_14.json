But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is Korean but appears Japanese, so the cashier and others at the store have been assuming they're Japanese. The cashier has been muttering complaints in Korean during checkouts, which the author could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier made a derogatory comment towards the author when there was a pricing error. The author wants to report this behavior to the manager but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the cashier's behavior of talking negatively about customers in another language, the specific incident where the cashier made a personal attack, and the author's intention to report it without wanting the cashier fired.\n\nFirst, the cashier's actions: even though she's doing it in Korean, the author can understand. The cashier's comments were disrespectful and potentially discriminatory. Even if the cashier thought the customer was Japanese, making a comment about someone's background or implying they're broke is inappropriate. The employer has a responsibility to ensure employees treat all customers respectfully, so reporting the behavior is reasonable.\n\nThe author's intent is to address the issue without getting the cashier fired. They might be concerned about the cashier's job security and don't want to overstep. However, the cashier's actions could be considered harassment or unprofessional behavior. The author isn't just reporting because they're offended; the cashier's words were personal and unprofessional. \n\nThe cashier's assumption about the author's background might also touch on racial or ethnic stereotypes, which adds another layer of inappropriateness. Even if unintentional, the comment was rude and could create a hostile environment. \n\nThe author is in a position where they can now understand the cashier's remarks, which they previously didn't act on because they thought the cashier was stressed. But after the direct insult, they have a valid reason to report. The employer should be informed so they can address the behavior, which is part of maintaining a respectful workplace and customer environment.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. They're addressing unprofessional conduct that affected them, and they're looking for a resolution that doesn't end in termination if possible. The cashier's actions were inappropriate regardless of the language used, and the author has a right to a respectful interaction.\n"
