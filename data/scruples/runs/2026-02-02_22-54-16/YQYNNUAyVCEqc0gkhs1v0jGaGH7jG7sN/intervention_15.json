But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean and bilingual but looks Japanese and was mistaken for that. The cashier used Korean to complain about customers, and when the author caught her after a pricing error, the cashier made a derogatory comment. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired. The user thinks the author is right, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier was speaking in Korean, which the author understood, and made a rude comment. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so the comment was made under the assumption that the customer didn't understand. The author is bilingual and found out. The cashier's behavior could be considered unprofessional, especially if it's directed at customers, even in another language. \n\nIs the author justified in reporting this? Well, the cashier's actions could be seen as harassment or unprofessional conduct. Even if the comment wasn't in English, making derogatory remarks about customers, regardless of the language, might be against workplace policies. The author is not trying to get her fired but to make her stop. \n\nHowever, the cashier might not have known the author understood Korean. But the author could be seen as taking advantage of the cashier's mistake. But the cashier's behavior was unprofessional. The author's intent is to address the behavior without causing harm. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. Reporting the behavior is reasonable to maintain a respectful environment. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
