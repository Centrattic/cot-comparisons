But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is Korean but bilingual in English and Korean. They live in an area with a lot of Japanese people and look Japanese. They go to a Korean grocery store weekly, and the employees probably think they're Japanese because they speak English to them. The cashier in question mumbles in Korean, which the author has ignored before, thinking she's just stressed. But then, after a pricing issue, the cashier says something harsh in Korean that the author overhears, which is offensive. The author now wants to report her to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nSo, first, the cashier is talking negatively about customers in another language, which the author understands. The cashier's comments are rude and discriminatory, even if not overtly offensive. The author is considering reporting because they found out the cashier was being disrespectful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting.\n\nThe cashier's behavior is unprofessional and possibly discriminatory. Even if the cashier thought the customer was Japanese, making a comment like \"go back to Japan\" is a form of harassment. The author has a right to a respectful environment. However, the author is Korean and kept it a secret, which might complicate things. The cashier didn't know the customer's background, so the comment was based on a mistaken assumption.\n\nBut does that matter? The comment is still offensive regardless of the cashier's intent. The author is in a position to report the behavior because they can understand the harassment. The store's management should address this to prevent a hostile environment. The author isn't trying to get the cashier fired but wants her to stop. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have confronted the cashier first or tried to resolve it privately. But in some cases, reporting to a manager is appropriate, especially if the behavior is repeated. The cashier's actions might be affecting other customers too, even if they don't understand Korean. The manager should handle it to maintain professionalism.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to report unprofessional and potentially discriminatory behavior. The cashier should be held accountable without immediate termination, as the author wishes. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
