But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author is Korean but appears Japanese, leading the cashier to speak English and not realize they're Korean. The cashier has been mumbling in Korean about customers, which the author can understand. The cashier made a racist comment after a pricing issue. The author wants to report her without getting her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the cashier's actions. She's using her native language to complain about customers, which might be seen as unprofessional. Even if it's not in English, if the customer can understand, it's still a problem. The cashier's comment was racist, which is definitely unacceptable regardless of language.\n\nThe author is bilingual and is taking the cashier to task for unprofessional behavior. The cashier's actions could be considered harassment or discrimination. The author isn't trying to get her fired but wants the behavior to stop. \n\nIs there any fault on the author's side? They didn't confront her on the spot but chose to report it, which is a reasonable step. They're also being considerate by not wanting her to lose her job. The cashier had no right to make that racist remark. \n\nSo, the author is acting in their own defense against harassment. The cashier is in the wrong, so the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
