But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation they described is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in Korean, which the cashier didn't realize the author could understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is Korean, bilingual in English and Korean, but is perceived as Japanese due to their appearance and lives in an area with a Japanese population. The cashier at the grocery store, who is also Korean, has been making derogatory remarks in Korean while serving customers, thinking the customers don't understand. The author, because of their bilingualism, can understand these comments and has been letting it slide until an incident where the cashier specifically targeted them with a comment after a pricing error.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The cashier is making negative comments about customers in what she believes is a language the customers don't understand.\n2. The author is multilingual and can understand these remarks.\n3. The cashier's behavior includes a personal attack after an interaction where the author pointed out a pricing error.\n4. The author wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her to get fired.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. The author is within their rights to want to address this, especially since the cashier's comments could create a hostile environment for other customers. The author's intention is to stop the behavior, not to harm the cashier's job, which shows consideration. The cashier's actions might violate workplace policies regarding harassment or inappropriate speech. \n\nHowever, there's a potential issue of the author's identity being hidden from the start. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, which might affect how the situation is perceived. But since the cashier was speaking in Korean regardless of the customer's language, and the author is a legitimate customer, the cashier's behavior is still unprofessional. The author's decision to report is a reasonable step to address harassment or unprofessional conduct, especially after a direct personal attack.\n\nThe author's motivation is to stop the behavior without causing the cashier to lose her job, which is a balanced approach. There's no indication the author is acting out of malice. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier to the manager.\n"
