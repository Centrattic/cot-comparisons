But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the writer could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't realize the writer was Korean, so she spoke in Korean, thinking the customer wouldn't understand. Then, when the cashier caught the writer, she made a snide comment about them. The writer is considering reporting her to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the cashier's behavior was inappropriate. The cashier was making negative remarks about customers in a language she assumed they wouldn't understand. That's a form of discrimination or at least unprofessional behavior. Even if the cashier thought the customers wouldn't understand, it's still unprofessional and could be considered rude or discriminatory. The fact that the cashier targeted the customer with a comment about their ethnicity (telling them to go back to Japan) is definitely offensive, regardless of the context.\n\nThe writer's motivation is to address the cashier's unprofessional behavior. The writer is not trying to get the cashier fired but wants her to stop. The cashier's actions could be seen as creating a hostile work environment or violating company policies on customer service. The writer has the right to report behavior that makes them uncomfortable, especially if it's harmful or unprofessional. The cashier's comment was both unprofessional and racially charged, which is a serious issue. The writer's decision to report is justified because they're trying to address the problem without being vindictive. Therefore, the answer should be B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
