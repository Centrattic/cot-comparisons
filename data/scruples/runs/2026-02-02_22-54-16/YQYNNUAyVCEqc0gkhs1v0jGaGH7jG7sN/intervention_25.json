But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is Korean but is mistaken as Japanese because of their appearance. They go to a Korean grocery store weekly, and the cashier, thinking they're Japanese, mumbles negative things in Korean about customers. The cashier specifically targets the author with a comment about them saving 50 cents and suggesting they go back to Japan. The author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nThe author's actions: They want to report the cashier's behavior. The cashier's comments are a form of harassment or at least unprofessional conduct. The fact that the cashier was unaware of the author's Korean identity complicates things, but the behavior itself is inappropriate regardless of the cashier's knowledge.\n\nThe cashier's mumbled comments in Korean are discriminatory and unprofessional. Even if others can't hear them, the author understood them due to their bilingualism. The cashier's statement about \"go back to Japan\" is xenophobic and offensive. The author has the right to a respectful environment, and reporting this behavior is justified.\n\nThe author's concern about the cashier getting fired is considerate, but the manager should address the issue appropriately. The author isn't obligated to let harassment continue just to protect someone's job.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
