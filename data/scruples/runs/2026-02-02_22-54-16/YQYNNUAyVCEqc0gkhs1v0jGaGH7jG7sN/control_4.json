But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to report the cashier. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is Korean but looks Japanese and is bilingual. They go to a Korean grocery store where employees assume they're Japanese. The cashier often talks negatively about customers in Korean, which the author can understand. Recently, the cashier made a derogatory comment towards the author, who now wants to report her to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nSo, the key points here. The cashier was being rude in another language, thinking the customer couldn't understand. The author, being bilingual, could hear and was offended. The cashier even made a personal attack after a pricing issue. The author wants to report this but is concerned about the cashier's job.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the cashier was being unprofessional and disrespectful. Even if the cashier thought the customer couldn't understand, it's still inappropriate. The author has a right to feel disrespected and to take action. However, the author is in a unique position because they can understand Korean. The cashier might not know the author is bilingual. But the comment was directed at the author, even if the cashier didn't realize they were Korean. \n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior without wanting the cashier to lose her job. That seems reasonable. The manager should be informed about unprofessional conduct. The author isn't trying to cause trouble but to address harassment. The cashier's remarks, especially the part about going back to Japan, are discriminatory and shouldn't be tolerated. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report this. The cashier's actions are the issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
