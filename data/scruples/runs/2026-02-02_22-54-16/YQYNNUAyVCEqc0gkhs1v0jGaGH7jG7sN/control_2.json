But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the writer, being bilingual, can understand. The cashier didn't realize the writer is Korean, so she thought the customer was Japanese.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She's been making complaints about customers in Korean, which the writer can understand. The cashier's comments, while not highly offensive, are still disrespectful. The user is upset because they're being talked about behind their back, which is a valid concern. The cashier's comment about the natto price led to her making a derogatory remark about the customer saving 50 cents and suggesting they go back to Japan. That's not just stress talking\u2014it's discriminatory and unprofessional.\n\nNow, the writer wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired. They're concerned about the cashier finding out they're Korean. The manager needs to be informed because the cashier's behavior is inappropriate and could create a hostile work environment or affect customer relations. The writer isn't just being petty; they have real evidence of the cashier's comments, especially the recent incident where the cashier made a derogatory remark.\n\nThe cashier's behavior is unprofessional and crosses the line into harassment. Even if she's not using explicit hate speech, the comment about going back to Japan implies xenophobia or racism. The writer is within their rights to report this. The fact that the cashier didn't know the writer is Korean doesn't negate the impropriety of her actions. Also, the cashier's stress and job tedium don't justify her remarks.\n\nThe writer is trying to address the issue without causing undue harm, so they're not being malicious. They just want the behavior to stop. The manager has a responsibility to ensure a respectful environment for both employees and customers. So, the answer should be that the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
