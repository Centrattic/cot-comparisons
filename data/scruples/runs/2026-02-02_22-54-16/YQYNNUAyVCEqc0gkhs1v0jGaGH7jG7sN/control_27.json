But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumes they're Japanese and speaks English to them. The cashier mumbles in Korean, which the author can understand, and recently made a derogatory comment. The author is considering reporting the behavior but doesn't want the cashier fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The cashier is using Korean to complain about customers, which the author can understand. The cashier's comments, while not highly offensive, are disrespectful. The author is concerned about the cashier's behavior but also about the consequences for the cashier's job.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting. On one hand, the cashier's behavior could be considered unprofessional or even discriminatory if the comments are targeting specific groups. The author has a right to feel disrespected and to take action if they believe they are being treated unfairly. On the other hand, the author is taking advantage of their knowledge of the cashier's native language to address an issue that the cashier might not have intended to be public. \n\nI should also consider workplace policies. Most employers have guidelines against harassment or unprofessional conduct. If the author can provide evidence (like the specific incident where the cashier made the comment), reporting it would be appropriate. The author's intention is not to get the cashier fired but to stop the behavior, which aligns with a reasonable concern about workplace conduct.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The cashier might not be aware that the author understands Korean. The author is using their bilingual advantage to address something that was intended to be private. But given that the comments were directed at the author, even if in another language, it's a form of targeted harassment that the author has every right to address.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They are taking a responsible approach by considering reporting the behavior without seeking to harm the cashier's job. The key points are the right to respectful treatment and addressing unprofessional conduct. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
