But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to report a cashier who was talking badly about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier didn't realize that. The cashier was mumbled in Korean, which the author understood, and made a derogatory comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The cashier didn't know the customer was Korean, which is why she spoke in Korean. The author is upset because she was being unprofessional and possibly racist. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired. \n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. Well, the cashier was being unprofessional and disrespectful, even if she didn't know the customer could understand. The author has a right to feel disrespected. Reporting it isn't necessarily wrong because it's about addressing inappropriate behavior. The author isn't trying to harm the cashier but wants her to stop. \n\nBut maybe the cashier didn't intend to be rude to the author since she didn't know. However, being rude to customers in general is still unprofessional. The author is bilingual and the cashier's comments were about customers, which the author overheard. The author isn't obligated to ignore the harassment, even if it wasn't directed at them personally. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The cashier was being unprofessional, and the author has a valid reason to report the behavior. Answer B.\n"
