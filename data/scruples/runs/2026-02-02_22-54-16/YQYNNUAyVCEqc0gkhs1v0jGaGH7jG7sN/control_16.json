But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the cashier at a Korean grocery store has been musing negative comments in Korean towards customers that the author has encountered. The author is Korean but has been mistaken as Japanese because of their appearance and the area's population. The cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean that the author understood, and now the author wants to report this behavior to the manager but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She's been musing negative comments in another language, which the author could understand due to being bilingual. The cashier's comment here was offensive, implying that the author was trying to save a few cents and even suggesting they return to Japan. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she might have been under the impression that no one would understand her. But since the author is Korean, they could hear and understand the comment. \n\nNow, the author's intent is to report the behavior because it's hurtful and inappropriate. The cashier's comments, even if not directed at the author specifically, are still unprofessional and could be considered discriminatory or disrespectful. The author is not looking to fire the cashier but just wants the behavior to stop. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting this. The cashier was being rude to customers, even if she thought no one could understand. The author has the right to address harassment or unprofessional conduct. By reporting the issue, the author is seeking a resolution without wanting to cause harm to the cashier's job. The manager should be informed so they can address the employee's behavior appropriately. \n\nHowever, the cashier might have been under stress, and the author initially gave her the benefit of the doubt. But the recent incident crossed a line. The author is in a position where they can report this, especially since they are bilingual and can provide the exact content of the comment. The author isn't spreading rumors but reporting a specific instance where the cashier used offensive language.\n\nSo, based on this, the author is not in the wrong. They are addressing a problem they've experienced and want to prevent others from facing similar situations. The cashier's actions were unprofessional, and the author is correctly seeking a resolution through the proper channels without malicious intent towards the cashier's employment.\n"
