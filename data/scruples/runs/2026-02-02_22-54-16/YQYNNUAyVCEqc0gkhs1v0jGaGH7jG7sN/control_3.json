But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The situation is that the cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the author understands. The cashier didn't realize the author is Korean because they look Japanese. The cashier said some things during a transaction error, like telling the author to go back to Japan and implying they're cheap.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is justified in reporting the cashier. The cashier's comments are in another language, but the author is bilingual. The cashier's behavior could be considered harassment or unprofessional. Even though the cashier might not have intended to target the author specifically (since they thought the author was Japanese), the comments were directed at the author during the interaction. \n\nThe author is concerned about the cashier getting fired, so they want to report the issue without causing termination. The manager might address the behavior without firing the cashier, so the author's intention is to stop the harassment without being vindictive.\n\nThe cashier's comments might not only be offensive but also create a hostile work environment if they do this to other customers. The author has a right to feel uncomfortable and report unprofessional behavior, especially since they are bilingual and can document the incident. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for reporting the cashier's unprofessional behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
