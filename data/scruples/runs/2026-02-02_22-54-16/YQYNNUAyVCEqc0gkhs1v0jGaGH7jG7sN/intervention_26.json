But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier didn't know the author is Korean and mumbled in Korean, but the author overheard her. The cashier made a derogatory comment after the author pointed out a pricing error.\n\nFirst, the cashier was using Korean to complain about customers, which was directed at the author. The author had a right to feel offended, especially after the cashier made a personal attack. Even if it's in another language, if the employee is using offensive language towards customers, it's a workplace issue. The author wants to report it but doesn't want the cashier fired, just to make her stop. \n\nThe cashier didn't realize the author's identity, so maybe she didn't intend to target the author specifically. However, the act of using negative language about customers is unprofessional regardless. The author is bilingual and understood the comment, so they have a valid reason to be upset. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional, and the author is within their rights to bring it up. The author isn't trying to get her fired, just to address the behavior. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
