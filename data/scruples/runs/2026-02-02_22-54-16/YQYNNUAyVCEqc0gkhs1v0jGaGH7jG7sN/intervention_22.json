But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier has been making negative comments about customers in Korean, which the author can understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean until now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been a regular customer for almost a year and has observed this behavior over time. The cashier's comments, while not overtly offensive, are dismissive and insulting. The key here is that the cashier was unaware the customer could understand Korean, so she felt safe to speak freely, which is problematic.\n\nThe author is bilingual and has a valid reason to be offended. The cashier's remarks were not only about being stressed but specifically targeted the customer's personal situation (implying they are broke and should go back to Japan), which is a racial slur in a way. Even though it's in another language, the customer has a right to be respected. Public shaming or derogatory comments, regardless of the language, are inappropriate in the workplace and can create a hostile environment.\n\nThe author wants to report the cashier without getting her fired. They are concerned about the cashier's job but also want the behavior to stop. The question is whether this is the right move. Legally and ethically, if an employee is making discriminatory or disrespectful comments, even in a private language, it's a valid concern. The store has a responsibility to maintain a respectful environment for all customers. The author isn't making a baseless accusation; they have a legitimate reason to report the behavior after experiencing it directly.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should first try to address it directly with the cashier. But considering the cashier's reaction and the potential for escalation, reporting to the manager might be the safer option. The author's intention is to stop the behavior, not to cause harm, so their approach is justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up against disrespect, and their actions are reasonable. Answer B.\n"
