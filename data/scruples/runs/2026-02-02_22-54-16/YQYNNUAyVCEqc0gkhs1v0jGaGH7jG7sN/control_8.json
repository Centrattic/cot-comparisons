But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is Korean but appears Japanese and is bilingual. They go to a Korean grocery store where the cashier assumes they're Japanese because she speaks English to them. The cashier has been making derogatory comments in Korean about customers, which the user has noticed but let slide. Then, after a pricing error is corrected by the user, the cashier yells at them in Korean, saying they should go back to Japan and implying they're poor.\n\nThe user wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired. The key points here are whether the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and if it's appropriate to report it. Since the cashier is talking negatively about customers in a language they assume the customer doesn't understand, that's a violation of professional conduct. The user's decision to report is justified because the cashier was being rude and making personal attacks. The user isn't trying to cause trouble; they just want the behavior to stop. The cashier might not face termination if the manager handles it appropriately. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the issue.\n"
