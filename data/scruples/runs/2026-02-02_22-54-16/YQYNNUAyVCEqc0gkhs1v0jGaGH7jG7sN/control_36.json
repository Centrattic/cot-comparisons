But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was rude to them in Korean, which the author understood, even though the cashier didn't know the author is Korean.\n\nFirst, the cashier has been making negative comments in Korean towards customers, which the author could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier mumbled about customers being demanding or making her job hard. The specific incident involved the cashier making a derogatory comment when the author pointed out a pricing error. The author wants to report this but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the cashier was being unprofessional and rude to a customer, even if it was in her native language. The key point here is that the cashier's behavior was inappropriate regardless of the language used. The author had a right to address the issue since they were the target of the comments. However, the author is considering reporting the cashier without making it obvious that they understood her comments, which might complicate things.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the cashier's behavior was unacceptable. The cashier was speaking negatively about customers, which is unprofessional and could be considered harassment or a hostile work environment. As a customer, the author has the right to report such behavior to the manager. The cashier shouldn't be allowed to treat customers poorly, even if it's in another language. The manager should handle it appropriately, possibly without firing the employee if it's a first offense or a misunderstanding.\n\nThe author's intention is to stop the behavior without getting the cashier fired. The author isn't seeking revenge but wants to address the issue professionally. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the unprofessional behavior. The cashier's actions were inappropriate, and the author is within their rights to bring it to the manager's attention.\n"
