But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The cashier mumbled in Korean, assuming the customer was Japanese, and then made a derogatory comment when she found out the price was wrong. The customer is Korean and bilingual but looks Japanese, so the cashier didn't realize. Now the customer wants to report her to the manager but doesn't want her fired. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The cashier was using Korean to complain about customers in a way that's unprofessional. The fact that she didn't realize the customer was Korean adds a layer here. The customer was being respectful, letting it pass before, but when the cashier made a personal comment, it crossed a line. \n\nThe cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional behavior. Even if the remarks weren't highly offensive, the content of her comment when the customer pointed out the error was clearly negative and implied that the customer is poor and that the cashier blames them for the mistake. The cashier's use of a different language (Korean) might have been a way to avoid detection, but the customer overheard it. \n\nThe customer's intent is to report the behavior because they feel it's inappropriate, especially after the cashier directed a comment at them. They don't want her fired, just to stop the negative talk. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the cashier is being unprofessional, and the customer is within their rights to report it. The cashier's assumption about the customer's identity might be due to racial stereotypes, which is problematic. The customer's decision to report could be seen as standing up for their right to not be subjected to such comments, even if the cashier didn't know their true identity. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the cashier wasn't aware the customer was Korean, so maybe her comments were meant for others. But the cashier's behavior was still inappropriate regardless of the customer's identity. The fact that the cashier used a comment targeting the customer's possible origin (Japan) and financial status makes it a direct issue. \n\nThe customer isn't seeking revenge but wants the manager to address the behavior. Since the cashier's actions are unprofessional and could affect other customers, reporting it is a responsible step. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
