But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is Korean but speaks English and looks Japanese, so the cashier assumes they're Japanese. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean about customers, and recently did so when the author pointed out a pricing error.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior is problematic. She's making derogatory remarks in another language, which is inappropriate regardless of the customer's background. The author, being bilingual, heard her comments, which were both about customers in general and directed at them personally. That's not okay. The cashier used offensive language and made personal attacks, which is unprofessional and could be considered harassment.\n\nThe author wants to report her but is concerned about the cashier's job. The key points here are whether the author has a right to report the behavior and if their intention is justified. The cashier's comments were targeted at the author after a customer interaction, which adds to the severity. The author isn't trying to get her fired but wants the behavior to stop. \n\nSince the cashier's actions are unprofessional and the author is within their rights to report harassment or inappropriate behavior, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They have a duty to address the issue for their own well-being and to prevent others from experiencing the same.\n"
