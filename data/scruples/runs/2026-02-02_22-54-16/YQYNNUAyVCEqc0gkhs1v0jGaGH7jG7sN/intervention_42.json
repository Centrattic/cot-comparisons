But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the author only realized because they're bilingual. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The cashier was mumbled in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier made a comment about the author being cheap and suggesting they go back to Japan. The author wants to report this but doesn't want the cashier to get fired. \n\nThe key points here are the cashier's behavior and the author's intent. The cashier was being disrespectful, even if it wasn't in English. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to address inappropriate behavior. The cashier's remarks were unprofessional and could be considered discriminatory or harassing, especially the part about going back to Japan. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to handle it carefully, which is commendable. They don't want the cashier to lose their job, just to make her stop the negative comments. There's also the element of the cashier not knowing the author is Korean, which adds a layer of irony. The cashier's behavior is unprofessional regardless of the language used. \n\nThe author has a right to report harassment or unprofessional conduct. The cashier's comments were directed at the author, and since the author can understand Korean, it's a valid concern. The store should maintain a respectful environment for all customers. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The cashier was being inappropriate, and the author is taking a responsible step to address it without overstepping. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
