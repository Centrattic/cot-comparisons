But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author understood. The key points here are the cashier's behavior, the author's intent to report, and the potential consequences.\n\nFirst, the cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the author can understand because they're bilingual. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she thought the author wouldn't understand. The recent incident where the cashier made a specific comment after a pricing error seems to cross a line. The author wants to address this by reporting to the manager but doesn't want the cashier fired. \n\nThe cashier's behavior could be considered unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, especially since she targets customers she thinks are Japanese. The author's decision to report might be justified because the cashier's actions could create a hostile environment for customers. However, the author is also trying to be considerate by not wanting the cashier to lose her job. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking this step. Reporting unprofessional behavior is generally acceptable, especially when it involves harassment or discrimination. The cashier's comments might be considered a form of workplace misconduct. The author has a right to a respectful environment, and reporting it isn't malicious if done with the intent to correct the behavior rather than cause harm. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a responsible action to address harassment and protect themselves from further negative interactions. The answer should be B (No).\n"
