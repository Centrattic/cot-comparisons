But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but the cashier didn't realize that because she looks Japanese and the cashier speaks to her in English. The cashier mumbled in Korean about customers being demanding, and then specifically insulted her after a pricing issue.\n\nHmm, the cashier was using Korean to talk about customers, which the author overheard. The cashier didn't realize the author is Korean. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired. The key points here are the cashier's behavior, the author's right to report it, and whether the author acted wrongly by doing so.\n\nFirst, the cashier's mumbled comments in Korean could be considered unprofessional or even discriminatory. If the cashier is making negative remarks about customers in another language, especially when the customer is actually part of that community, that could be a form of harassment. The author is bilingual and can understand, so the comments were directed at her without her knowing initially. Now that she knows, she's concerned about the behavior.\n\nThe author's intention is to address the behavior without causing the cashier to lose her job. Reporting the behavior to the manager is a reasonable step to ensure a better work environment for everyone. The author isn't making false accusations; they have a legitimate reason based on what was said.\n\nThe cashier's comments were not only about the author but other customers as well. Even if they weren't overtly offensive, the fact that the cashier talks this way in front of customers could be a policy violation. The author is acting in a responsible way to bring this to the manager's attention, especially since they now know the cashier doesn't know they're Korean. The cashier's behavior might be affecting other customers too, even if they don't understand Korean.\n\nThe author didn't confront the cashier directly, which could lead to a confrontation. Instead, they plan to report it to the manager, which is a professional approach. The concern about the cashier being fired is valid, but the author's action is about stopping the behavior, not necessarily getting her fired. The manager would handle the situation appropriately.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. Reporting unprofessional behavior is justified, especially when it's done in a language the customer understands, and it affects the shopping experience. The answer should be B.\n"
