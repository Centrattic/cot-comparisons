But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who was speaking negatively about customers in Korean. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been mistaken for Japanese by the employees. The cashier has been making rude comments in Korean, which the author only realized because they're fluent. Now, the author is conflicted about reporting this because they don't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier was using another language to complain about customers. The author is bilingual, so they understood the comments. The cashier's behavior could be seen as unprofessional, especially if she's talking negatively about customers, even if it's not in English. However, the author is in a tricky position because the cashier might not know they're Korean, so the comments were made without knowing they could be understood.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior without wanting the cashier fired. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking this step. The cashier's actions might be a form of workplace harassment or unprofessional conduct. The author has a right to address something that's affecting their shopping experience, especially since the cashier's comments were directed at customers, which could impact the store's reputation and customer satisfaction.\n\nHowever, the cashier might have been unaware that the author was Korean, so the author didn't feel the need to correct that earlier. But once the cashier made a personal comment, the situation escalated. The author's decision to report it after witnessing direct unprofessional behavior seems reasonable. They are not just reporting a personal grievance but pointing out a pattern that could be affecting other customers as well.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is overstepping by reporting an employee without ensuring the cashier knew their identity. But since the cashier made the comment directly to the author, it's a direct instance of misconduct. The author's desire to address the behavior without getting the cashier fired shows they're being considerate, which is a positive aspect.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author is standing up against a colleague's inappropriate behavior, which is generally acceptable. However, the store's policy on employee conduct would also play a role here. If the store has a no-tolerance policy for such behavior, the author is right to report it. If not, maybe the approach is different. But since the cashier's actions are unprofessional, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to address it.\n"
