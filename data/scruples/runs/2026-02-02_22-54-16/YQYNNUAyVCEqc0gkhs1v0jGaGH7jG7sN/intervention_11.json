But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is Korean but bilingual in English and Korean. They look Japanese and live in an area with a Japanese population. They go to a Korean grocery store every week, and the employees probably think they're Japanese because they speak English to them. The cashier, who is Korean, has been mumbling in Korean about customers, but the author didn't say anything before because they thought maybe the job is stressful. However, the cashier recently said something more direct in Korean, which the author could understand, making a derogatory comment about them saving 50 cents and telling them to go back to Japan. The author wants to report this to the manager but doesn't want the cashier fired. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in another language, which the author could understand because they're bilingual. The cashier's comment was not just complaining but included an ethnic slur, telling the author to \"go back to Japan,\" which is a form of racial or ethnic discrimination. The author wants to address this behavior without causing the cashier to lose her job.\n\nThe author is in a position where they can understand the cashier's remarks, which others might not. The cashier's actions could be considered discriminatory, especially since part of the comment was about the author's ethnicity. The author is not looking to cause harm but to stop the negative behavior. The cashier's actions might be a form of harassment or discrimination, which the author has a right to address, especially if they are a customer and feel targeted.\n\nThe author is concerned about the cashier getting fired, which shows they are trying to balance their rights with the cashier's job security. However, the cashier's behavior is inappropriate and potentially illegal if it's based on the customer's ethnicity. The author's intent is to report the issue to the manager for resolution, not to retaliate or cause harm unnecessarily.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not at fault here. They are bringing up a legitimate concern about harassment or discrimination, which should be addressed. The cashier's actions are the issue, not the author's decision to report it. The author is trying to resolve the problem constructively without being vindictive. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier's behavior.\n"
