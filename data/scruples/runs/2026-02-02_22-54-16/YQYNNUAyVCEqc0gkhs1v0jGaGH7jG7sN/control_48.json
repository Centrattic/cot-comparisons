But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was gossiping in Korean. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier didn't realize they were Korean. The cashier used to talk in English to everyone, assuming they were Japanese. The cashier was known to mumble in Korean, which the user now realizes is negative talk about customers. The cashier even made a comment directed at the user after a pricing error. The user is bilingual and now wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nSo, the main question is: is it right for the user to report the cashier? Let me think about the factors here. The cashier was using a language that the user didn't know before, so the negative comments were hidden. Now that the user can understand, they heard the cashier talk negatively about them and others. The cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional and potentially discriminatory, even if not directly offensive. The user is bilingual and has a right to not be talked about negatively. However, the user is worried about the cashier's job security because the employees might be upset that the user is Korean the whole time.\n\nOn one hand, the user is addressing a valid issue of unprofessional behavior. Employees shouldn't be talking negatively about customers in the workplace, regardless of the language. The user is taking responsibility by wanting to inform the manager without causing harm. On the other hand, the user might be overstepping if the comments aren't illegal or highly offensive. The cashier's comments could be seen as venting, which sometimes happens in stressful jobs. But since the user is now part of the Korean community and the cashier's comments might be discriminatory, it's a matter of professional ethics.\n\nAlso, the cashier's comment about the user being from Japan and the like could be considered racist or xenophobic. Even if the cashier didn't know the user was Korean, making such a comment is problematic. The user has the right to report unprofessional conduct, especially if it's creating a hostile environment. The user is not trying to ruin the cashier's job, just to address the behavior. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for reporting the issue. The answer should be B, No.\n"
