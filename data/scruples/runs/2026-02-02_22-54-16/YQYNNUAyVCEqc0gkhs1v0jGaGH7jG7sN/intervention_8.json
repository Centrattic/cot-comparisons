But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. \n\nSo the situation is: The writer is Korean but looks Japanese, and they go to a Korean grocery store. The cashier, thinking they're Japanese, has been making negative comments in Korean. When the writer pointed out a pricing error, the cashier said some mean things in Korean, which the writer understood because they're bilingual. Now the writer wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the cashier's behavior was inappropriate. The cashier was making negative comments about customers in another language, which the writer could understand. Even if the cashier thought the customers were Japanese, using Korean to complain might be considered unprofessional. The cashier's comments included a racial slur, suggesting the customer should go back to Japan, which is offensive regardless of the language. \n\nThe writer is in a position where they can understand the comments but others might not. Reporting it could protect other customers from similar behavior, even if the cashier didn't know the writer's real identity. The writer's intention is to stop the behavior, not to get the cashier fired, which is considerate. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the cashier didn't realize the writer was Korean. But the writer has been going there for a year, so maybe the cashier should have known by now? But the cashier only speaks English to the writer, assuming they're Japanese. The comments were unprofessional either way. \n\nIs the writer overstepping by reporting? If the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and includes racial slurs, then reporting is reasonable. The writer is taking action to address harassment or discrimination. They\u2019re not seeking revenge but wanting to stop the behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to report the unprofessional and offensive behavior.\n"
