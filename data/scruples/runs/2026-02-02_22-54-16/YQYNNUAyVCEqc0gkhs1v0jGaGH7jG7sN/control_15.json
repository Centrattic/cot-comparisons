But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The author is Korean but looks Japanese, lives in an area with many Japanese people. They go to a Korean grocery store weekly, and the employees probably think they're Japanese since they speak English. The cashier, who is also Korean, uses Korean to speak to other Korean customers but uses English with the author. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean while working. The author found out after an incident where the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, which the author understood.\n\nNow, the author wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the cashier's actions are inappropriate and if the author is justified in reporting them. The cashier was speaking negatively about customers in another language, which the author understood. Even though it was in Korean, the author is bilingual and heard the comments. The cashier made a specific offensive comment towards the author, implying they should go back to Japan and calling them broke. That's pretty clear verbal abuse or harassment, even if it's in a different language.\n\nThe author's intention is to report the behavior to the manager, not to get her fired. The author is concerned about the cashier's behavior affecting the work environment and customer experience. Since the store is a business, it's reasonable to expect that employees treat customers respectfully. The manager should be aware of any harassment or unprofessional conduct.\n\nThe cashier's actions are unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. The author's decision to report is about addressing the behavior, not exposing the cashier's mistake of not knowing the author's Korean identity. The author is in a position to understand the comments, so they are within their rights to bring it up. The manager should handle it appropriately, and the cashier might need to be reprimanded, but the author isn't out of line for taking that step.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the cashier's behavior is inappropriate, and the author is justified in reporting it.\n"
