But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a cashier who was being rude in Korean, which the author understood. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean since they were mistaken for Japanese.\n\nFirst, the cashier was mumbled complaints in Korean, which the author overheard. The author has been dealing with this for a while, letting it slide thinking it was stress. Then a specific incident happened where the cashier made a derogatory comment towards the author. The author is bilingual, so they understood the Korean slurs. The main issue is that the cashier was being unprofessional and disrespectful, even if it was in another language. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The cashier was indeed talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand. 2) The cashier's comment included a racial slur, telling the author to go back to Japan, which is offensive. 3) The author wants to report it but doesn't want the cashier to lose her job.\n\nEmployers expect a certain level of professionalism and respectful treatment of customers. If an employee is making derogatory remarks, even in another language, it's a valid concern. The author isn't trying to get the cashier fired, just to address the behavior. The cashier's actions could be considered harassment or a hostile work environment, especially if directed at customers.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting. Since the cashier's behavior was unprofessional and included a racial comment, the author has a right to report it. The intention isn't malicious; the author wants the behavior to stop. The cashier is at fault for the inappropriate remarks, not the author for reporting them. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
