But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is Korean and bilingual but looks Japanese, so the cashier assumes they speak English. The cashier has been complaining in Korean about customers, which the person could understand. The cashier even directly insulted the person, using a derogatory term and making a racial comment. The person wants to report the cashier to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nI need to consider a few things. The cashier was using offensive language directed at customers, which is unprofessional. The person has a right to a respectful environment. The fact that the cashier didn't realize the customer was Korean adds complexity, but the behavior itself is still inappropriate. The person's intent is to stop the behavior, not to get her fired immediately. That seems reasonable. However, some might argue that the person is overstepping by reporting someone who didn't know their identity. But the cashier's actions involved racial slurs and harassment, which are serious. So, the person is probably not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
