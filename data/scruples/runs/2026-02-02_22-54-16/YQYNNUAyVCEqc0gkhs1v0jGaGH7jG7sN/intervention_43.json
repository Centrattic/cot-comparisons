But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The person is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The cashier assumes they're Japanese because the employees only speak English to them. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, which the author couldn't understand at first but now knows because they're bilingual. The cashier said something rude when the author pointed out a pricing error, and now the author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the cashier was making disparaging remarks in her native language, assuming the customer couldn't understand. That's a privacy breach, but the employee might not realize the customer can understand. However, the cashier was being unprofessional by making comments about customers. The author has a right to a respectful environment. The cashier's comments were not just stress but targeted the customer, implying they should go back to Japan, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nThe author is in a bind because reporting might reveal their Korean identity, which could create tension. But the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and discriminatory. The store should handle employee conduct that affects customers. The author isn't trying to get the cashier fired but wants the behavior to stop. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the issue. They have a right to be treated with respect, and the cashier's actions crossed a line. The answer should be B.\n"
