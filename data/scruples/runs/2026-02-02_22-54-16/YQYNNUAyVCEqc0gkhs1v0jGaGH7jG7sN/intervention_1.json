But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The situation is that the cashier has been talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author can understand. The cashier didn't realize the author is Korean, so she mumbled complaints in Korean. Then, when the author pointed out a pricing error, the cashier made a comment that was offensive in Korean, which the author heard. The author wants to report this to the manager but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The cashier was being rude to customers, which is unprofessional. The author is bilingual and understood the comments, which were disrespectful. Reporting this is a way to address the behavior. The author isn't trying to get her fired, just to stop the negative talk. \n\nIs there any reason the author would be in the wrong? Maybe if they lied about their identity? But in this case, the cashier assumed the author was Japanese, so they didn't lie. The author is using their language skills to protect themselves and others. The cashier's comments were inappropriate regardless of the language used. The manager should be informed to maintain a professional environment. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to report the behavior without malicious intent. The answer should be B.\n"
