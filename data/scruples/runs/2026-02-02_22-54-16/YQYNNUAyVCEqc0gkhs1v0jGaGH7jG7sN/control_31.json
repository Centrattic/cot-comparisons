But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The cashier, thinking the author is Japanese, has been making derogatory comments in Korean, which the author can understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The cashier is mumbling in Korean, which the customers might not understand, but the author does. The cashier's comments are negative towards customers, but the author didn't confront her before because they thought she was just stressed. However, in the recent incident, the cashier made a direct insult, mentioning Japan and implying the customer was poor. \n\nThe author is considering reporting her but doesn't want her fired. They're worried about the employees finding out the author is Korean all along. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for reporting? Well, the cashier was making negative remarks towards customers, which is unprofessional and could be considered harassment. The fact that the author is bilingual allows them to hear the comments, but others might not. The cashier's behavior is inappropriate regardless of the language used. The author's intent is to stop the behavior without causing job loss, which is reasonable. However, the cashier might not have known the author is Korean, so the comments were targeted at the assumption the customer is Japanese. But that doesn't excuse the negative talk. The author has a right to a respectful shopping experience. Reporting it to the manager seems justified, especially since the cashier made a direct personal insult. The manager needs to address unprofessional behavior. The author isn't trying to harm the cashier but to improve service for everyone. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
