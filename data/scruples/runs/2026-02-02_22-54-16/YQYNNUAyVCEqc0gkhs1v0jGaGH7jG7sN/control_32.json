But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is Korean but appears Japanese. They go to a Korean grocery store where the cashier assumes they don't speak Korean. The cashier often mumbles complaints in Korean during checkout, which the author can understand. This time, after a pricing error, the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean, which the author heard. Now, the author wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior is inappropriate. Even if she didn't realize the author speaks Korean, making derogatory comments about customers is unprofessional. The author is within their rights to want to address this. The cashier's remarks could be considered discriminatory or rude, regardless of the language used.\n\nHowever, the author is in a tricky position because the cashier didn't know they were Korean. If the author reports this, it might lead to the cashier finding out, which could cause embarrassment or conflict. But the author's intent is to stop the behavior, not just to get the cashier in trouble. The manager should handle it appropriately, maybe through counseling or training, not immediate termination.\n\nIs the author wrong for reporting? Reporting unethical or unprofessional behavior is generally right. The cashier's comments are not okay, and the author has the right to a respectful service. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They are standing up against inappropriate behavior without intent to harm the cashier's job.\n"
