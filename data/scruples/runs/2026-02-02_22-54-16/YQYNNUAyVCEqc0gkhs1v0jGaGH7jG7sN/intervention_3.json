But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. \n\nFirst, the cashier was musing in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier made a comment that was not only about the situation but also included a personal attack, suggesting the customer should go back to Japan. The author is Korean, but looks Japanese, so the cashier didn't realize the customer could understand Korean.\n\nThe key points here are: the cashier was being disrespectful, using a language the customer understood, and making a personal attack. The author is bilingual and didn't confront the cashier on the spot but now wants to report her without causing her to lose her job. \n\nThe author's intention is to stop the behavior without being vindictive. The cashier's comments could be considered harassment or rude behavior towards a customer. Since the store is a Korean grocery store, it's possible other employees might not be aware of such behavior, especially if they're not bilingual. \n\nThe author isn't seeking retaliation but wants to address the issue. The cashier's actions were unprofessional and crossed a line by including a personal insult. The author has a right to feel disrespected and report it. The manager should know if there's a problem affecting customer experience and employee conduct. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They're taking responsibility to address the issue appropriately. The cashier is the one who acted inappropriately. So the answer should be B.\n"
