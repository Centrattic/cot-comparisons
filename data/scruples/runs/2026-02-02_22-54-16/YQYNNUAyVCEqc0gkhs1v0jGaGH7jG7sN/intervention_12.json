But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they go to a Korean grocery store, but they look Japanese and are bilingual. The employees think they're Japanese and speak English to them. The cashier has been mumbling in Korean, which they understand, and now the author is considering reporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. She's been complaining about customers in another language, which the author can understand. That's a problem because even if the cashier thinks she's not being overheard, the author is right there and can hear it. The cashier made a derogatory comment when the author pointed out a pricing error. That's pretty clear harassment or at least unprofessional behavior.\n\nNow, the author is bilingual and didn't correct the cashier's assumption about their ethnicity. Instead, they used this to their advantage to catch the cashier's behavior. But is that fair? They didn't want to expose the cashier to potential job loss, which is a consideration. However, the cashier's comments are unprofessional and potentially discriminatory. The author has a right to a respectful interaction, and reporting the behavior is a reasonable step to ensure that happens.\n\nThe cashier's actions could be considered a form of workplace misconduct, especially if she's using her native language to make derogatory remarks about customers. The author isn't trying to cause trouble, just to stop the negative behavior without harming the cashier's job. The manager needs to be aware of the issue to address it appropriately. Since the author is in a unique position to understand the comments, they have a right to act.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report this. They're standing up for themselves and possibly other customers. The cashier's behavior is inappropriate regardless of the language used, and the author is taking a responsible step without seeking to fire the employee. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
