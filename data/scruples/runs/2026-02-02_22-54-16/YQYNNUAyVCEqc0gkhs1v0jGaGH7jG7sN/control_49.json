But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to report the cashier who was talking negatively about customers in another language. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and has been going to a Korean grocery store. The cashier assumed the author was Japanese and spoke English to them. The cashier mumbled in Korean during checkout, which the author could understand. The cashier even made a comment about the author being cheap and suggesting they go back to Japan. The author wants to report this behavior but doesn't want the cashier fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cashier's actions. The cashier was using Korean to complain about customers, which the author could understand. The cashier's comment was offensive, even if not in English. The manager might not know about this behavior because the cashier thought the author didn't understand Korean. The author has a right to a respectful service, regardless of the language the cashier used. \n\nThe cashier's comment included a racial slur (\"go back to Japan\") which is clearly unacceptable. Even if the cashier didn't realize the author understood Korean, making such a statement is still discriminatory. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to report this. However, the author is concerned about the cashier losing her job. But workplace harassment shouldn't be tolerated, and the manager should address it without necessarily firing the employee immediately, maybe through training or counseling.\n\nThe author isn't spreading rumors; they have a specific incident to report. Since the cashier's behavior was directed at a customer and included offensive language, the manager should be informed. The author's intent is to stop the behavior, not to get the cashier fired, which is reasonable. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a valid reason to report the cashier's inappropriate comments and behavior.\n"
