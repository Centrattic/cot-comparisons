But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean. The author is Korean but appears Japanese and has been mistaken for Japanese by the employees. The cashier mumbled in Korean, which the author could understand, including some rude comments. The author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The cashier was being disrespectful to customers, even if it wasn't in English. The employees should treat all customers professionally regardless of the language they use among themselves. The author, being Korean, was targeted with negative comments, which is unprofessional and could be considered rude or discriminatory. \n\nThe author's intention is to address the behavior without causing the cashier to lose her job. The question is whether reporting the issue is justified. The cashier's actions might violate workplace conduct policies, as employees should maintain professionalism. The author isn't making false accusations; they have a legitimate reason to report the behavior. \n\nHowever, the author is in a position where they can understand the comments due to their bilingualism. The cashier may not have intended for the author to hear, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The manager should be informed to address the issue, possibly through training or disciplinary action. \n\nThe author's motivation is to stop the negative comments, which is reasonable. They are not seeking revenge but want to maintain a respectful environment. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The correct answer would be B.\n"
