But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier has been musing negative comments about customers in Korean, which the author, who is Korean but mistaken as Japanese, overhears. The cashier made a specific derogatory comment towards the author when a pricing error occurred. The author wants to report her without getting her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The cashier is talking negatively about customers in another language, which the author understands. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean, so she assumed the author was Japanese. The author is bilingual and has been going to the store for a year. The cashier's comments were not highly offensive but included a personal attack when the pricing issue happened.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting the cashier. The options are A or B. \n\nThe cashier's behavior involves negative talk about customers, which is unprofessional. Even if it's in Korean, if the store has policies against harassment or unprofessional behavior, the author has a right to report it. The fact that the cashier didn't realize the author was Korean might affect the intent, but the behavior itself is still unprofessional regardless of the audience. \n\nThe author isn't trying to cause trouble; they just want the behavior to stop. They're concerned about the cashier losing her job, which shows consideration. The cashier's comment was directed at the author and included a personal attack (\"go back to Japan\"), which could be considered discriminatory or racist. \n\nIn such cases, reporting inappropriate behavior is generally the right thing to do. The author isn't taking revenge but addressing a legitimate issue. The cashier might have policies in place, and the manager should handle it appropriately. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
