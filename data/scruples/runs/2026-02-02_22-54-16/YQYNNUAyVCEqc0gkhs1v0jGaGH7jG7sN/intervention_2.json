But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is Korean but looks Japanese and lives in an area with many Japanese people. They shop at a Korean grocery store where the cashier assumes they're Japanese because they speak English. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean about customers, which the user has noticed but ignored before. Then, during a recent interaction where there was a pricing error, the cashier made a derogatory comment in Korean implying the user was being cheap and to go back to Japan. The user now wants to report the cashier but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and rude, especially since she's making derogatory remarks about customers. The user is justified in feeling upset, especially since the cashier not only made a personal attack but also did it in front of others. Even though she was speaking Korean, the user understands that language, so the comment was directed at them. The cashier's remarks could be considered discriminatory or xenophobic, which is a serious issue in the workplace.\n\nThe user doesn't want to get her fired, which shows they're trying to be fair. They want the manager to address the behavior without firing her. Since the cashier didn't realize the user is Korean, there might be an element of unconscious bias or prejudice here. The user has a right to a respectful shopping experience and to report harassment or discrimination. By reporting the incident, the user is taking responsibility for their experience and seeking a resolution that doesn't harm the cashier's job, which is a balanced approach.\n\nConsidering all that, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier's inappropriate behavior. The cashier's actions were unprofessional and the user is acting within their rights to address it. So the answer should be B.\n"
