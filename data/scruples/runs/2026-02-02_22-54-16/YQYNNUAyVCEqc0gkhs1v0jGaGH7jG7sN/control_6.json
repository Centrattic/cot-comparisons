But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report a cashier who was talking negatively about customers in Korean, which the author could understand. The cashier didn't know the author was Korean because they look Japanese. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The cashier was making negative comments about customers in another language. The author is bilingual and overheard these comments. The cashier's behavior was inappropriate, even if it wasn't directly towards the author. The author wants to report the cashier but does so in a way that doesn't get her fired.\n\nIs the author justified in reporting this? Well, the cashier was using work time to make negative remarks about customers, which is unprofessional. The fact that it's in another language doesn't make it acceptable. The author is within their rights to report harassment or unprofessional behavior, even if they can understand it because they're bilingual. The cashier's comments could be considered workplace harassment or creating a hostile environment for customers.\n\nHowever, the author is hiding their Korean identity. The cashier is making assumptions based on appearance, which might be a point. But the cashier's behavior is still unprofessional regardless. The author's intention is to stop the behavior, not to expose the cashier's mistake. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue. The cashier's comments could affect other customers too, so reporting it is a valid action. The author isn't trying to get her fired but to make her stop the behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
