But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier, who works at a Korean grocery store, has been making derogatory comments in Korean towards customers, including the author. The author is Korean but looks Japanese and the cashier didn't realize that. The cashier made some comments towards the author recently, and now the author wants to report her but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cashier was talking negatively about customers in another language, which the author understands. The cashier's comments were not highly offensive but were still disrespectful. The author is bilingual and has been going to the store for a year. The cashier made a specific comment after a pricing issue, which the author addressed.\n\nI think the author is in the right because the cashier's behavior is unprofessional and creates a hostile environment. The cashier is talking negatively about customers she assumes are Japanese (since the author looks Japanese but is actually Korean), which is a form of stereotyping. The author's intention is to stop the behavior, not to get the cashier fired. The store's management has a responsibility to maintain a respectful workplace and customer environment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the issue to the manager. The cashier's actions are inappropriate, and the author is taking a reasonable step to address it. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
