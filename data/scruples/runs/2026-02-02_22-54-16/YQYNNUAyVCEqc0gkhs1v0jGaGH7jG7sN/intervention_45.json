But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier. The situation is that the cashier, who thought the customer was Japanese, was talking negatively about customers in Korean. The customer is actually Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier didn't realize. The cashier made a derogatory comment when the customer pointed out a pricing error.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior: she's been mumbling complaints in Korean about customers. The customer is bilingual, so she understood the recent comment. The cashier's words were rude and unprofessional. The customer wants to report her but doesn't want her fired. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong for reporting? Well, the cashier was being unprofessional and possibly violating store policies by speaking negatively about customers. The customer has a right to a respectful experience. Even though the cashier didn't know she was Korean, the comment was still inappropriate. The customer isn't trying to cause trouble but wants the behavior to stop. So, the customer isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
