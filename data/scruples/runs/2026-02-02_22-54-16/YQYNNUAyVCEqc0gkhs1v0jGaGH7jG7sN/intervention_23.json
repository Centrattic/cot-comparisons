But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for wanting to report the cashier for talking negatively about customers in Korean. The author is Korean but looks Japanese, so the cashier and employees thought the author was Japanese. The cashier has been making negative comments in Korean, and then when the author caught her, the cashier made a derogatory comment. The author wants to report this but doesn't want her fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the cashier was wrong. The cashier was talking badly about customers in another language, which is considered \"shit-talking.\" The author clearly heard the cashier's negative comments, even if others didn't. The cashier's actions could be considered unprofessional and potentially harassment, especially if she was making a racial comment (\"Why not go back to Japan\") when the author corrected the price.\n\nThe author's intent is to report the behavior but not get the cashier fired. They want the manager to address the behavior. The cashier's comments are offensive and unprofessional, so reporting is reasonable. The author isn't making false accusations; they have a direct experience. The cashier's lack of awareness that the author is Korean adds to the inappropriateness, as she thought she was talking to a Japanese customer and made a racial slur.\n\nIs the author at fault for wanting to report this? The cashier's behavior is unprofessional, and the manager should be informed. The author isn't seeking revenge but wants to stop the negative behavior. The cashier's actions could affect the business's reputation and create a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for reporting.\n"
