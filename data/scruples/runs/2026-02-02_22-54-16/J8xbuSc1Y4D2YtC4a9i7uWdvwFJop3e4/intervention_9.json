Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the sushi bar. Everything was going well until a homeless woman came in, sat next to them, was coughing a lot, looked very dirty, and smelled bad. The author and their dad told the staff to remove her, and they did. But the author then left, and the question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman was homeless, which is a sensitive issue. The restaurant didn't remove her at first, even though she was coughing and looked unwell. The author's reaction was to demand her removal, and when that happened, they still left. The restaurant tried to apologize and give them a free roll, but they didn't stay. \n\nNow, from a social justice perspective, some might argue that the author is being judgmental or discriminatory. The homeless person might have a right to be served, and the author could be seen as contributing to stigma or exclusion. On the other hand, the author and their dad were concerned about health risks from the coughing and the smell, which is understandable. But is that a valid reason to demand someone be removed? \n\nHomeless individuals are entitled to the same services as others, provided they behave appropriately. However, the woman's health condition (potential TB-like cough) could be a valid health and safety concern. But in most places, restaurants can't just kick someone out for being sick unless they're a direct threat. However, if the person is coughing in a food area, maybe there's a health code violation. But maybe the restaurant staff didn't act because they can't just remove someone based on appearance. \n\nThe author's parents might have overstepped by demanding her removal, and the restaurant's responsibility is to serve everyone, unless there's a genuine health risk. The author's reaction might be seen as inconsiderate or discriminatory. However, the smell and coughing could be legitimate discomfort. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. If the woman wasn't breaking any rules and the restaurant served her, the author's reaction could be seen as rude. However, if the staff allowed her to stay despite the health concerns, maybe the restaurant is at fault. \n\nBut the author's action was to ask the staff to remove her. If the staff did remove her, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the act of demanding someone be removed from a public place based on their appearance and health status could be problematic. It's a delicate balance between personal discomfort and social responsibility. \n\nIn some contexts, people might support the author's decision because they were uncomfortable and felt their health was at risk. Others might argue that it's not their place to request someone's removal unless there's a clear violation of policy. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory, especially if the woman wasn't a direct threat. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground. If the restaurant had policies against serving someone who's visibly ill, then it's different. However, the restaurant didn't act initially, so the author stepping in might be seen as overreaching. \n\nAlternatively, if the author's parents were concerned about health and safety, maybe they should have asked the staff for their opinion rather than demanding removal. So, the author's approach might be impolite or inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer could be A.\n"
