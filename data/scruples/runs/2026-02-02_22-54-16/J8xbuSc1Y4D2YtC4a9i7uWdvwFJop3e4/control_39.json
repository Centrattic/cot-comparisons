Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user went to a new Japanese restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, they were sitting at the sushi bar, and everything was good. Then a homeless woman came in and sat next to them. She was very dirty, had a terrible cough, and the restaurant staff didn't do anything except bring her a glass of water. The user and their dad told the restaurant to remove her or they would leave. The staff did remove her, and they left, not eating the free roll offered.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The restaurant is a public space where people of all backgrounds should be allowed to eat. The woman was homeless and possibly ill, which makes the situation sensitive. However, the user and their dad demanded that she be removed because of their discomfort. \n\nNow, are they justified in their actions? On one hand, they felt unwell due to the cough and smell, which is understandable. On the other hand, asking a restaurant to remove a customer based on their appearance and health might be discriminatory. Restaurants are supposed to serve people regardless of their socioeconomic status, unless there's a violation of rules (like causing a disturbance, being a health hazard, etc.). \n\nBut was the woman a health hazard? The user says her cough sounded like TB, but that's an assumption. TB is contagious, but unless she's actively spreading it, maybe it's not a valid reason. Also, not everyone has to serve everyone, but if the restaurant is serving her, others can't force them to remove her. However, the user and their dad chose to leave if she wasn't removed. \n\nIs it the user's responsibility to protect their own comfort, or is it wrong to demand the removal of a homeless person from a restaurant? There's a difference between not wanting to be there and requesting the restaurant to eject someone. The user might be in the wrong because they asked the restaurant to remove a customer based on their appearance, which could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the person was actually a health risk, maybe the staff should have intervened. But the staff didn't, so maybe the user felt justified. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the user is in the wrong for their actions. In many places, restaurants can't discriminate against customers based on appearance, disability, or health status unless there's a legitimate safety concern. The user's demand to remove the woman could be seen as discriminatory. However, they did leave the restaurant, so they didn't force the staff to serve her. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might say that the user and their dad were being intolerant, while others might empathize with their discomfort. The fact that the woman was homeless and unwell adds another layer. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the user's actions were a reasonable request or an overreaction. The user's main argument is that they felt unwell and wanted to protect their own health and comfort. The counterargument is that they should not have demanded the removal of a patron based on her condition. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to handle their own discomfort without requesting the removal of others. The restaurant could have offered to move them to another seat or provided a mask, but the user chose to leave. The staff did apologize and give a free roll, but the user still left. \n\nConsidering all this, the user might not be in the wrong because they did leave the restaurant and didn't force the removal, but they could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because they were discriminatory. If B (no), because they left and didn't force the restaurant to serve her. \n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, often the person is not in the wrong if they leave the situation rather than forcing the removal. So maybe the answer is B. But I need to be careful here. The key is whether the action of demanding removal is wrong. If the restaurant is allowed to serve her, the user can't demand her removal unless there's a valid reason. Since the user's reason was discomfort, that might not be sufficient. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for their demand. However, they left, so maybe it's not as bad. \n\nI'm a bit torn. But I think in this context, the user is in the wrong because they asked the restaurant to remove a patron based on their condition without a legitimate health and safety reason. The staff didn't act, so their demand was perhaps unwarranted. Therefore, the answer could be A. However, others might argue that they are not in the wrong because they left the restaurant. \n\nLooking at similar AITA examples, often the person who leaves is not in the wrong if they are not forcing the issue. So maybe B is the correct answer. But the act of demanding removal is where the line is. So if they demanded the removal, even if they left, they could be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they asked for the removal of a customer based on their appearance and health, which is discriminatory. The fact that they left might mitigate some of that, but the act of demanding removal is where the issue is. Therefore, the answer is A."
