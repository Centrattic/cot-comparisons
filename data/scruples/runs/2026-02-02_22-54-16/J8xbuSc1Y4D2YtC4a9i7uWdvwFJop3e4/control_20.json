Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (AITA) is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves the author and their dad going to a new Japanese restaurant. They were at the sushi bar when a woman, described as homeless and very dirty, sat next to them. She started coughing, which the author found alarming. They confronted the staff, leading to her being escorted out. The author then left without finishing their meal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is whether their reaction was appropriate. The restaurant served the woman, which is commendable as some places might refuse service to homeless individuals. However, the author felt uncomfortable and left when the staff didn't remove her immediately. \n\nThe author's reasoning was based on health concerns due to her appearance and coughing. They were worried about potential illness (like TB) and the smell. However, it's possible that the restaurant had protocols in place for such situations, and maybe they were already handling it. The staff did apologize and offered a free roll, but the author left anyway.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and etiquette. While it's important to be considerate of others' well-being, demanding the removal of a customer based on appearance and coughing could be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant has the right to serve anyone, and unless the person was a threat or violating health codes, refusing service might be illegal. The author might be displaying biases against homeless people. However, they were also within their rights to leave if they felt uncomfortable, even if their actions were not the most compassionate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they didn't allow the staff time to handle the situation. The woman might have had a legitimate reason for her appearance and cough, and the restaurant was doing their part by providing water and assistance. The author's immediate demand for her removal could be viewed as dismissive of her situation and the restaurant's policies.\n\nSo, the balance here is between the right to public accommodation and the personal right to choose where to spend money. The author isn't in the wrong in terms of leaving, but their approach in demanding the woman's removal might be. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong overall. Given that they left after the issue was addressed (she was escorted out), and the restaurant apologized, maybe their actions were justified from their perspective. But the way they handled it could be seen as rude or discriminatory.\n\nAlternatively, the act of leaving because a homeless person was served could be seen as a refusal to support the restaurant for accommodating someone they disapprove of, which is problematic. The author might be in the wrong for prioritizing their own discomfort over the restaurant's inclusive policies. It's a nuanced situation where both the restaurant's actions and the author's reaction have valid points.\n"
