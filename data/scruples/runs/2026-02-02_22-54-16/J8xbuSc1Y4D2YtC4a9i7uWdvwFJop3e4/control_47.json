Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, and when a homeless person with a bad cough came in, they demanded she be removed. The staff complied, but the couple left upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author and their dad felt uncomfortable and concerned about hygiene and health. The woman was coughing a lot, which could be a legitimate health concern, especially if it's a contagious illness. In that case, maybe they had a right to ask for their safety. Also, restaurants are public spaces, and patrons can request removal of someone if they're causing a disturbance or health hazard. But the woman was just sitting there; maybe the coughing was disruptive enough to be considered a disturbance.\n\nOn the other hand, the decision to ask her to leave could be seen as discriminatory. Homeless people already face stigma and exclusion, and the author might have been contributing to that by treating her as unwelcome. Even if the coughing was concerning, the restaurant staff didn't act on it initially, so the patrons taking it upon themselves to remove her might be overstepping. Restaurants typically handle such situations through their staff, not customers. Also, the woman's appearance being dirty might have triggered a bias, making the author act unkindly.\n\nAnother angle is the response of the restaurant. They did apologize and give a free roll, which might indicate that they saw the patrons' request as valid. But the fact that the staff didn't intervene until the customers demanded it could mean they weren't following health safety protocols properly. Or maybe the staff was under pressure from the customers. Either way, the author's actions might have been influenced by their own discomfort rather than a legitimate threat.\n\nThe author left without eating, which might be their choice, but the act of demanding someone else's removal could be seen as inconsiderate. There's also the question of whether the author had the right to demand her removal. As a customer, they might not have the authority to ask someone else to leave unless there's a clear violation of restaurant policy or health codes. The restaurant's decision to comply might have been to prevent a scene rather than a health concern.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, some argue that people should be more inclusive and not push others out of public spaces unless there's a genuine threat. Others might say that health and safety are paramount and that the author acted in self-preservation. The key here is whether the coughing posed a real health risk. TB is airborne, but if she wasn't confirmed to have it, the author's assumption might be unfounded. However, if the coughing was severe and persistent, it could be a legitimate concern.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author's actions were based on perceived health risks and discomfort, but they may have made assumptions about the woman's condition and acted on them. The restaurant's staff didn't initially intervene, suggesting the situation wasn't a clear emergency. Therefore, the author's demand for her removal might be seen as inconsiderate and contributing to the marginalization of a homeless person. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
