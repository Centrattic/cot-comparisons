Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by leaving the restaurant because a homeless person was being served. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author went to a new sushi place with their dad. The restaurant was packed. Then a homeless woman entered, looked very dirty, had a bad cough, and the author and their dad demanded she be removed. The staff complied, but the author left because of the smell and discomfort.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the restaurant serves all customers regardless of their situation. The woman was there, and the staff didn't ask her to leave until the author and dad intervened. The author's main concerns were the health risk from the cough and the smell. They might feel those were valid reasons to ask for her removal.\n\nOn the other hand, the homeless person has a right to access public spaces, including restaurants, unless she's causing a disturbance. The author's actions might be seen as discriminatory, assuming the woman was homeless and dirty. Also, the restaurant didn't initially have an issue with her presence, so maybe the staff handled it appropriately by providing water and not removing her unless requested.\n\nThe author's reaction could be based on fear or discomfort, but does that justify their actions? Some might argue that they overreacted and didn't consider the woman's circumstances. However, others might empathize with the author's health concerns, especially if the cough really sounded severe.\n\nI need to check if the restaurant had a policy against serving homeless individuals. The story doesn't mention that. The staff didn't act on their own, so maybe the author's request was out of line. Also, the author left immediately after the woman was escorted out, which might be seen as dismissive rather than understanding.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, is it acceptable to demand the removal of another customer based on appearance and perceived health risks? That's debatable. Restaurants can't discriminate, so the staff had to serve the woman. The author's decision to leave might be their choice, but the way they confronted the staff could be seen as rude.\n\nThe key points are the health concern and the discrimination aspect. If the woman was actually a health risk, maybe the author had a point, but the story doesn't clarify if there was a real medical issue. It was the author's perception. So the author might be in the wrong for not assuming the best and instead acting on their own judgment, which could be discriminatory.\n"
