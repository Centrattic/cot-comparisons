Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The restaurant is in a sketchy area with amazing reviews. The person went there with their dad, and a homeless woman entered, coughed a lot, was visibly unclean, and the smell was overwhelming. The family asked the restaurant to remove her, and when they did, they left without eating the free roll.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let's think about the ethical aspects. On one hand, the restaurant should serve everyone, regardless of their appearance or situation. It's their right to be served. The family's decision to ask her to leave might be seen as discriminatory. Homeless people often face stigma and exclusion, and the family's reaction could contribute to that.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's condition could pose health risks. Coughing that badly might be contagious, and the smell could affect other customers' experience. However, the restaurant is responsible for managing such situations. The family's immediate reaction might be seen as rude, especially if they didn't give the restaurant enough time to handle it themselves. Also, the restaurant did apologize and offered a free roll, so maybe the family overreacted by leaving anyway.\n\nBut the key point is whether the family was in the wrong for demanding her removal. In many places, it's against the law to discriminate based on someone's appearance or status. Restaurants can't refuse service to homeless individuals. So by asking to remove her, the family might be violating the restaurant's policy and the woman's rights.\n\nThe answer here is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they discriminated against the homeless woman. Even if her presence was uncomfortable, the restaurant should handle their own policies. The family's reaction was based on her appearance and health, which is a form of discrimination.\n"
