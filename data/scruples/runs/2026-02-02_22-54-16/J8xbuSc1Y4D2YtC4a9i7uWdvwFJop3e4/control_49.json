Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a new Japanese restaurant, which was packed, and they had a good experience until a homeless woman came in. The woman was very dirty, coughing, and the restaurant didn't seem to do much except give her water. The author and their dad threatened to leave unless the restaurant removed her. The staff apologized, removed her, but the author still left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The restaurant is serving food, and people have the right to refuse service, but is it right to demand someone else be removed? The couple felt threatened or disgusted by the woman's appearance and coughing. However, homeless individuals also have rights, including access to public spaces like restaurants unless they're causing a disturbance. The question is whether the author's action was justified.\n\nThe woman's coughing could be legitimate, and the restaurant's initial non-response might have been appropriate if the woman wasn't a threat. The couple's demand to remove her could be seen as discriminatory or inconsiderate. Even if the author felt unwell, they could have handled it differently, like asking the staff to address the situation without directly demanding ejection. The fact that they left without eating after the incident adds to the question of their reaction's proportionality.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant is a business and can set its policies. If the woman was indeed a health risk, the staff should have addressed it. The author might argue they had the right to protect their health. But the key is whether the woman was actually a threat. If the staff didn't see a problem, the couple's overreaction could be the issue. Also, the author left immediately, which might be seen as not giving the restaurant enough chance to resolve it.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's actions could be seen as discriminatory, pushing the staff to remove a homeless person based on appearance and illness, which might not be justified. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers unless there's a valid reason. The author's demand to remove the woman might be inconsiderate and wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
