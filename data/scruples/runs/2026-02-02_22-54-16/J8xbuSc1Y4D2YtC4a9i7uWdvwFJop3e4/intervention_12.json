Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant when they saw a homeless person being served. The situation involves a homeless woman with a severe cough and appearance that caused discomfort. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and their dad went to a restaurant with good reviews but in a sketchy area. The restaurant was packed, so they sat at the sushi bar. Then a visibly sick and dirty homeless woman came in and sat next to them. The author felt uncomfortable due to her cough and appearance, confronted the staff, leading to her being escorted out. They left without eating the free roll given.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the homeless woman was a customer, and the staff didn't seem to intervene initially. The author's concern might be about health and safety, especially with the cough potentially being contagious. On the other hand, the author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory, as they asked to remove a homeless person, which might be based on bias rather than a genuine health hazard.\n\nThe restaurant's responsibility is to provide a safe environment for all customers. However, a homeless person doesn't inherently pose a health risk unless there are specific signs of illness that justify concern. The staff didn't act initially, but the author decided to take action. The line between protecting health and being discriminatory is thin here.\n\nThe author's justification is based on the smell and cough, which they found offensive and potentially dangerous. However, the restaurant's response was to apologize and give a free roll. The author left, possibly due to discomfort but not necessarily a violation of restaurant policies. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to consider compassion and empathy. Choosing to remove a homeless person might be seen as contributing to stigma. However, if the person was indeed ill, the concern for health is valid. The situation is ambiguous because we don't know the exact cause of her cough or hygiene condition. \n\nI think the author's action was based on their discomfort and fear, which is understandable in a public eating establishment. However, their approach might have been confrontational and could be perceived as inconsiderate towards the homeless woman. The fact that the restaurant handled it by apologizing and offering compensation suggests that they recognized the concern. But the author's decision to leave could be seen as overreacting, especially if the staff didn't find the situation problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had reasons to feel uncomfortable, their reaction might have been influenced by bias and could be seen as inconsiderate. However, their primary concern was health and safety. The answer might depend on balancing these factors. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide between A and B. Considering the situation's ambiguity and the potential for both valid concerns and discriminatory actions, I'm leaning towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because their action was a response to perceived health risks, even if it might have been influenced by discomfort with homelessness.\n"
