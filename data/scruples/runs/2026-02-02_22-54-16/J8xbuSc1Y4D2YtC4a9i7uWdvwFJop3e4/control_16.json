Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation is that the author and their dad went to a new sushi place in a sketchy area. The place was packed, they were at the bar, and then a homeless woman came in, looked dirty, had a terrible cough, and they demanded she be removed, which the staff did. Then they left without eating the free roll offered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant is in a sketchy part of town, so maybe they have a policy of serving everyone regardless of their situation. The woman was homeless, which is a social issue that often brings up questions about treatment and dignity. The author felt uncomfortable and worried about their health due to the cough and the smell. But is it wrong to leave because of that?\n\nI should think about the rights of the restaurant versus the customers. Restaurants are public spaces and should serve all people unless they are causing a disturbance. The woman was brought in a glass of water and not removed initially. The author and their dad might have felt health concerns, but is that a valid reason to ask for her removal? The coughing and smell could be disturbing, but maybe the restaurant is doing their job by providing service to someone in need. \n\nAlso, the author's actions\u2014telling the staff to remove her or they'd leave immediately\u2014could be seen as aggressive. The staff did remove her, but was that justified? If the woman wasn't actually a threat, maybe the restaurant was accommodating, and the customers overstepped. On the other hand, if the coughing was alarming (like TB symptoms), maybe they had a right to be concerned. However, the staff didn't react initially, which might mean they didn't see a problem. \n\nThe author's apology and free roll might have been the restaurant's way of diffusing the situation, but the fact that they left anyway could indicate that their reaction was more about discomfort than a legitimate health issue. The question is whether their reaction was appropriate. \n\nHomeless individuals often face discrimination, and public places are supposed to be accessible to everyone. The author's decision to leave might be based on prejudice rather than actual safety concerns. The staff's inaction suggests they didn't find her a threat, so maybe the customers were inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't have the authority to demand someone to leave unless there was a clear violation of rules like being disruptive. The scenario seems more about the author's discomfort than a justified health issue. Plus, public spaces should be inclusive, and their reaction could be seen as discriminatory towards a homeless person. The staff handled it by offering service and eventually removing her when the customers pushed for it, but the initial decision to confront and leave could be problematic.\n"
