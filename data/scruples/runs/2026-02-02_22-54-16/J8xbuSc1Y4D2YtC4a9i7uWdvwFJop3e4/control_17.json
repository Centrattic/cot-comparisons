Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person with a bad cough and poor hygiene was being served there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person and their dad went to a new restaurant. When a homeless woman entered, they were initially okay but became disturbed by her cough and appearance. They told the staff to remove her, and when they did, the customers left without eating their free food.\n\nNow, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Let me break it down. Legally, a restaurant can't discriminate against someone for being homeless, right? They have to serve everyone unless there's a health or safety issue. The woman's cough could be a health concern, but that's subjective. The customer's reaction is about their comfort versus the restaurant's responsibility to serve all.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The customers felt unsafe or uncomfortable, which is their right. However, asking to remove someone based on their appearance or health status might be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant didn't act initially, so maybe they didn't see a problem. The customers then took it upon themselves to have her removed, which the staff did. \n\nBut is that the customer's role? Should they intervene in such situations? Also, the woman was a customer too, and the restaurant has a duty to serve. The customers leaving might be their choice, but the act of demanding her removal could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: the restaurant's responsibility. If they allowed her in, they might be okay, but if they failed to address a health issue, maybe they have a duty to act. But the customers aren't in charge of that. The restaurant staff made the decision to remove her, so maybe the customers weren't wrong in requesting it.\n\nHowever, the underlying issue is whether it's right to ask for another customer to be removed based on their appearance and perceived health. That can be seen as prejudiced. The person might not have TB, and her being dirty is a matter of circumstance, not her fault. The customers' reaction could be seen as judgmental and contributing to stigma against homeless people.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the customers overstepped by demanding her removal. If the restaurant staff didn't see a problem initially, but the customers did, maybe they were being intolerant. The fact that the staff eventually removed her might suggest that there was an issue, but it's unclear. But the customers' actions might be seen as inconsiderate towards the homeless woman's rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the customers might be in the wrong for demanding her removal based on their discomfort, even if they left afterward. The author's actions could be seen as discriminatory. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
