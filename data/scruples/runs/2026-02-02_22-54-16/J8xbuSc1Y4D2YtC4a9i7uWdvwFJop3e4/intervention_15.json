Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person went to a new restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they were at the sushi bar. Then a homeless woman with a bad cough came in and sat next to them. The author describes her as very dirty and smelling bad. They told the staff to remove her, and when they did, they left without eating the free roll.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the restaurant should serve everyone, but if someone is a health risk or making others uncomfortable, maybe staff have a duty to act. The woman had a cough that sounded severe, which might be a health concern. The staff didn't do anything at first, which could be a problem. The author and their dad asked to remove her, which might be reasonable if they felt threatened or unwell. But then they left when she was escorted out. \n\nHowever, the author's actions could be seen as judgmental. They made assumptions about the woman's health and hygiene, which might not be fair. Homeless people often face stigma, and just because someone looks disheveled doesn't mean they're a health hazard. Also, demanding her removal could be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers unless there's a clear threat. The smell and cough could be due to many reasons unrelated to her being homeless. \n\nOn the other hand, if the cough was indeed contagious, the restaurant might have a duty to protect others. But the staff didn't act initially, so maybe the author was justified in escalating the situation. However, the immediate reaction of leaving after she was removed might be seen as harsh. The author could have given the restaurant a chance to address the issue without leaving immediately. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author's concern for their health is understandable, but their approach might have been harsh. They could have asked for a table change or waited for the staff to handle it. Leaving immediately after the woman was removed might be seen as overreacting. But if they genuinely felt violated or unwell, maybe they had a right to leave. The key points are whether the woman was actually a health risk, if the staff handled it appropriately, and if the author's reaction was proportional. \n\nConsidering all that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were trying to protect their health, but there's a case to be made that they could have handled it differently without leaving. However, the stigma involved in judging someone based on appearance is a valid point against them. But since the question is about being in the wrong, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because they were acting on health concerns, even if their approach was judgmental.\n"
