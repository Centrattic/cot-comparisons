Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was being served there. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's policy. If the restaurant serves all customers regardless of their background, then refusing to serve someone based on their appearance could be against their policy. The restaurant didn't ask the homeless woman to leave until the customers complained. That might be a point against the restaurant, but the customers' actions need to be considered too.\n\nThe author and their dad demanded that the restaurant remove the woman. That's a problem because customers don't have the authority to tell a restaurant who to serve. It's possible they overstepped their bounds here. Restaurants can ask people to leave for various reasons, like causing a disturbance, but the woman wasn't doing anything disruptive except perhaps coughing. If she was coughing, maybe it's a health concern, but that's something for the restaurant or health officials to handle, not individual customers.\n\nThe author mentions the woman's appearance and smell, which are subjective. The fact that the restaurant didn't remove her initially suggests they didn't find her a threat. The customers' reaction could be seen as discriminatory. They left after the woman was escorted out, which the restaurant did in response to their complaint. That might mean the restaurant complied, but the customers' insistence on her removal could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is about health concerns. However, unless the woman was visibly ill in a way that posed a direct threat (like open sores or something), the health risk is speculative. The restaurant's responsibility is to maintain hygiene, but they might have addressed it by providing a glass of water and dealing with the coughing. The customers' demand to remove her could be based on prejudice rather than a legitimate health issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory. They didn't handle the situation respectfully, using their position as customers to pressure the restaurant. The restaurant did their part by giving her water, and the customers' reaction was overreaching. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
