Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about them leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person went to a new restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they were at the sushi bar. The food was good, but then a homeless woman came in and sat next to them. She was very dirty, coughed a lot, and smelled bad. The family asked the staff to remove her, and when they did, they left without eating the free roll.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong, I should look at the ethics and social norms. On one hand, the restaurant serves all customers, including homeless people, which is a social responsibility. Discriminating against someone based on their appearance or status is generally frowned upon. The family's actions might be seen as contributing to a hostile environment for that individual.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's appearance and cough could have made other patrons uncomfortable, especially if they were concerned about health and safety. However, the staff didn't seem to address the situation; they just brought her water. The family's request to remove her might have been out of concern for their health or discomfort. But is that a valid reason to ask someone to leave? \n\nWait, the staff did remove her after the family asked. So the staff complied, but the family still left, which could be seen as holding a grudge or being overly sensitive. Also, the woman was a customer, and the family's public request to remove her could be seen as bullying. The family might be prioritizing their own comfort over the restaurant's commitment to serving all customers, which is a key part of social inclusivity.\n\nAnother angle: the restaurant's responsibility to serve all customers and the family's right to feel comfortable. If the restaurant is in a sketchy area and still serves everyone, maybe they have a policy to be inclusive. The family's actions could undermine that policy. Also, the smell and cough might be health concerns, but unless the person is actually ill, it's hard to justify medical reasons. The family assumed she was sick based on the cough, but that's not a medical diagnosis.\n\nSo, the family might be in the wrong for making the staff remove a customer based on appearance and perceived health risks, which could be seen as discriminatory. The fact that they left after getting the free roll might also show they were more focused on their own discomfort than understanding the situation. The answer is likely A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
