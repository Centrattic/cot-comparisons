Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves the author and their dad going to a new sushi restaurant. They were about to order more when a visibly disheveled and ill woman sat next to them. The author found her coughing and appearance so disturbing that they demanded the restaurant remove her, which they did. Then they left without eating the free roll offered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The restaurant is in a \"sketchy\" area but has good reviews. The woman is homeless, dirty, and coughing. The restaurant didn't serve her any food beyond water. The author and dad felt uncomfortable, asked for her removal, which happened, then they left.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, asking someone to leave a public place can be seen as discriminatory, especially if they're homeless. The restaurant might have policies about health and safety, but if they allowed her to sit, maybe they didn't see her as a threat. The author's reaction is based on fear of illness and discomfort, but is it justified? Homeless individuals often face stigma and are treated poorly in such situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt physically ill from the cough and smell. If the restaurant didn't take action, maybe they were also in violation of health codes. However, the woman wasn't causing any immediate harm beyond being a visibly unwell person. The restaurant might have a responsibility to serve all customers unless there's a specific rule against it. The author's demand to remove her could be seen as enforcing a standard that the restaurant itself didn't apply, which might be considered rude or prejudiced.\n\nAlso, the fact that the restaurant complied suggests they might have had some flexibility. But that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. Public places are for everyone, and while health concerns are valid, reacting by demanding someone's removal could be seen as inconsiderate. The author could have chosen to leave without confronting the restaurant, but instead, they used their presence as leverage to get the woman removed.\n\nIn terms of societal perspective, there's a growing awareness about treating homeless individuals with dignity. Some might argue that the author contributed to the marginalization of a vulnerable person. However, others might empathize with the author's discomfort in a situation where they felt their health was at risk. It's a tricky balance between personal comfort and social responsibility.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the restaurant didn't have a policy against serving her, then the author's request could be seen as overstepping. The action was based on appearances and potential health concerns rather than an actual health violation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more tolerant and for contributing to the exclusion of a homeless person. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
