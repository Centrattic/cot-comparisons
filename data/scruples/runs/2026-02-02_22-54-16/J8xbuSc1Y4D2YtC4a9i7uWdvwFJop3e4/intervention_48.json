Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant when they saw a homeless person being served. The story is from the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit, so the person is seeking validation or criticism.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person went to a new restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the sushi bar. Everything was good until a homeless-looking woman walked in, sat next to them, started coughing, and had a bad smell. The author and their dad told the staff to remove her, and when they did, they left the restaurant despite the apology and free roll.\n\nThe key points here are: the woman was homeless, dirty, coughing, and smelly. The staff didn't seem to intervene except to give her water. The author felt uncomfortable, threw up their appetite, and left. The question is whether they are in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the author and their dad might have felt health concerns, especially with the cough sounding serious and the smell. They might have been worried about hygiene and their own well-being. On the other hand, the woman was a customer, and the restaurant's responsibility is to serve everyone, including homeless individuals. The staff didn't ask her to leave, so the authors took it upon themselves to demand her removal. That could be seen as judgmental or discriminatory.\n\nThe AITA subreddit often looks at intent and impact. The authors' intent was to ensure their own comfort and health, but the impact was on the homeless woman. Was their action necessary? Maybe they could have left on their own without confronting the staff. Also, the restaurant might have had a policy on such situations, but the staff didn't act, so perhaps the authors overstepped.\n\nHowever, the authors didn't physically harm the woman, just asked for her removal. The restaurant complied, but then the authors left, which might be seen as a choice not to support the restaurant for not handling the situation properly. But maybe the authors should have considered that the staff might have their reasons and just left quietly.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's often considered wrong to discriminate against homeless individuals, especially in public spaces like restaurants. The authors' reaction could be perceived as classism, even if they felt health concerns. However, in some cases, people do have the right to refuse service to someone if there's a health risk, but the woman was already a customer. The authors might not have the authority to demand her removal unless there was a clear violation of the restaurant's policies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the authors might be seen as in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and for making a judgment based on appearance and smell. They could have left the restaurant without confronting the staff, but instead, they demanded action, which could be seen as rude or discriminatory.\n"
