Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation is that the author and their dad went to a new sushi place in a sketchy area. The place was packed, and when a visibly homeless woman with a bad cough sat next to them, they demanded she be removed. The staff didn't do much at first, just gave her water, but after the authors' intervention, she was escorted out. The authors then left without eating the free roll offered.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The restaurant serving a homeless person isn't inherently wrong. The authors were concerned about the woman's appearance and cough, which led to their discomfort. But is that a valid reason to demand she leave? \n\nThe woman's health could be a factor. If she was coughing so violently that it was a health hazard, maybe the staff should have addressed it. But the authors didn't wait for the staff to act; they confronted them and only after that did the staff remove her. That might be problematic because the restaurant is responsible for handling such situations, not the customers. Also, the woman's dignity might have been compromised. Homeless individuals often face stigma, and being asked to leave by customers could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the reason is her appearance. \n\nThe authors' actions are based on their own comfort, which is understandable, but it's about whether their actions were justified. The restaurant's policy might include accommodating all customers, regardless of their background. Even if the woman was a regular customer or part of their community outreach, the authors' demand might have been rude. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of public health. If someone is coughing and potentially contagious, the restaurant should ensure safety. However, the authors didn't check if she was a health risk; they made assumptions based on her appearance. That's a stereotype and could be offensive. \n\nSo, the key points are: the authors made a judgment based on appearance, didn't give the staff a chance to handle it, and possibly contributed to the woman's stigmatization. On the other hand, if the staff was negligent, maybe the authors had a point. But generally, customers shouldn't dictate who is served. Therefore, the authors might be in the wrong for not handling it more respectfully or through other means, like contacting management instead of confronting the staff directly and leaving immediately after. The answer could be A.\n"
