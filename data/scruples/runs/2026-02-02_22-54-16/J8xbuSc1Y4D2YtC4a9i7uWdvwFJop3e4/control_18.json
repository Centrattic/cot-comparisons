Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to a new restaurant, which was in a sketchy area but had great reviews. They were at the sushi bar, enjoying themselves, when a homeless woman came in, looked dirty, coughed a lot, and they felt uncomfortable. The restaurant didn't do anything, so the author and their dad told the staff to remove her. Then they left after getting a free roll but didn't eat it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The person was homeless and visibly unwell. The restaurant didn't intervene, so the customers demanded her removal. That seems like a problem because homeless people often face discrimination and being asked to leave a public place can be seen as rude or discriminatory. The author's reasoning was about health and safety, but is that a valid excuse? \n\nIn many places, homeless individuals have the right to be in public spaces, including restaurants, unless they're causing a disturbance. If the woman wasn't breaking any rules, asking for her to be removed could be considered unethical. Also, the author's reaction might be influenced by their personal discomfort rather than actual health risks. The smell and coughing might have been off-putting, but that doesn't mean the restaurant is obligated to remove her. \n\nOn the other hand, if the restaurant felt it was necessary to remove her for health reasons, they should have done so themselves. The customers shouldn't have to dictate that. The fact that the restaurant didn't act until the customers demanded it might indicate that the staff was already aware of the situation but chose not to intervene, which could be a separate issue.\n\nSo, the author's main fault is possibly in demanding the removal of someone based on their appearance and symptoms without knowing if there was a legitimate health risk. They might have acted out of fear or prejudice rather than a real threat. Therefore, their actions could be seen as discriminatory. The correct answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they judged the homeless person and took it upon themselves to remove her, which isn't their place.\n"
