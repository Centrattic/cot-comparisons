Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person and their dad going to a new sushi restaurant. The place is packed, and they sit at the bar. The food is great, but then a homeless woman comes in, looks really dirty, coughs a lot, and they get uncomfortable. They tell the staff to remove her, and when they do, they leave the restaurant without eating the free roll they were given.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue seems to be about the treatment of a homeless person. The person in the story is making a judgment based on the woman's appearance and health, which might be influenced by stigma. Homelessness is a complex issue, and people might have various reasons for their situation. \n\nThe woman was coughing, which the author compared to TB. That's a serious illness, but the author didn't confirm if she was actually sick. The smell and appearance are also factors. The staff didn't intervene except for giving her water. The author and their dad demanded her removal, and the staff complied. Then they left, not eating the free food.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, everyone has the right to be treated with dignity. Restaurants are public places, and it's possible that the woman was a customer. The staff didn't ask her to leave initially, so maybe the author's reaction was based on discomfort rather than a health risk. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author felt they were in a situation where they couldn't enjoy their meal due to the woman's presence. They might have been concerned about hygiene or health. However, it's important to consider that the staff might have their own policies about such situations. The fact that the staff didn't remove her before the customers intervened might mean that they didn't see her as a threat. \n\nAlso, the act of demanding her removal could be seen as discriminatory. It's possible that the author and their dad were acting out of fear or prejudice, which is a problem. The fact that they left immediately after she was removed might indicate that their main issue was the presence of the woman, not the restaurant's actions. \n\nThe free roll offered by the chef as an apology might have been a good gesture, but the customers didn't accept it. That could be because they were too upset or felt the situation wasn't handled to their satisfaction. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to treat all people with respect and not make assumptions based on appearance. The author's actions could be seen as contributing to the marginalization of a homeless person. However, they were also customers who felt their experience was ruined. \n\nAnother angle is the health aspect. If the woman was genuinely ill, especially with something contagious, there might be health code issues. But the author didn't confirm her illness. The staff didn't act on it before, so maybe they didn't see it as a threat. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author might be in the wrong because they judged the woman based on her appearance and demanded her removal without considering her rights as a customer. Restaurants should be inclusive, and demanding someone's removal based on their appearance is discriminatory. The staff's decision to remove her after the customers asked might have been influenced by the customers' pressure rather than a legitimate health concern. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions were based on prejudice and not a valid health threat, leading to the mistreatment of a homeless individual.\n"
