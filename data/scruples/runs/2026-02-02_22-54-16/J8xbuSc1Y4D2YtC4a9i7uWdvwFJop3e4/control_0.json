Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who left the restaurant because a homeless person was being served is in the wrong. The situation involves a homeless woman with a bad cough and poor hygiene, which made the author and their dad uncomfortable. The restaurant didn't ask her to leave initially, so the customers demanded it. The staff then apologized, offered a free roll, but the customers left anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, regardless of their background. Homeless individuals have the same right to be served as anyone else. The customers essentially told the restaurant to remove the woman because of her appearance and cough, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nBut then, there's the aspect of health concerns. The woman's cough sounded severe, which might raise hygiene issues in a restaurant setting. However, the restaurant is responsible for handling such situations, not the customers. It's up to management to assess if someone is a health risk. The customers overstepped by confronting the staff and demanding her removal. \n\nAlso, the reaction of the customers was to leave once the woman was escorted out. While they might have felt uneasy, their action of demanding her removal could be seen as inconsiderate. Restaurants should accommodate all patrons, and the customers' behavior might be perceived as intolerant towards homeless individuals. \n\nHowever, one might argue that the customers had the right to feel uncomfortable and leave. But the key point is whether they had the right to demand the woman's removal. That's where the line is crossed. The staff did apologize and tried to compensate, but the customers' insistence on leaving might not make them the wrongdoers entirely, but they did contribute to a discriminatory act.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the customers' actions in demanding the homeless person's removal are problematic. The author is in the wrong for treating the homeless woman as a problem to be removed rather than the restaurant handling it appropriately. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
