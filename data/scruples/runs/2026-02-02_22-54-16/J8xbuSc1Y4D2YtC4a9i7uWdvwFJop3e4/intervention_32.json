Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person and their dad went to a new sushi restaurant. The place was busy, and they were at the bar. Then a homeless-looking woman with a bad cough joined them. The author felt uncomfortable, the smell was overwhelming, and they demanded the restaurant remove her or they'd leave. The restaurant complied, but they still left without eating the free roll.\n\nNow, the main question is whether they are in the wrong. Let's think about the key points. The woman was a customer, and the restaurant had a right to serve her unless there was a reason not to. The author's main issues were the health concern from the cough and the smell. However, assuming the woman was homeless doesn't necessarily mean she's a health risk. Coughs can be from many things, not just TB. The restaurant staff didn't seem to address the situation, which might be their fault for not handling it better.\n\nFrom a social responsibility angle, turning someone away because of their appearance or homelessness could be seen as discriminatory. Restaurants are public spaces and should be inclusive. The authors might have overreacted based on assumptions. They didn't give the restaurant a chance to handle the situation, like moving the woman to a different area or providing cleaning supplies. Instead, they made a demand. \n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to feel uncomfortable and leave a situation they find unpleasant. The smell and cough likely made their dining experience unpleasant, but the response was abrupt. They might have escalated the situation by not being more patient or giving the staff a chance to resolve it without confrontation. \n\nLegally, restaurants can ask people to leave if they're causing a disturbance, but the woman wasn't disruptive. The authors' action was based on their own discomfort, which is a valid feeling, but it's a question of whether their response was appropriate. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about balancing personal comfort with social responsibility. Choosing to leave might be acceptable, but demanding the restaurant remove someone else could be seen as inconsiderate. The authors might have been right to leave, but their method of doing so (demanding her removal) was perhaps inconsiderate and discriminatory. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards A, the authors being in the wrong. But I should also check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if the woman was a health risk, but the story doesn't confirm that. The authors assumed she was, which could be the issue. Also, the restaurant's lack of action might be a problem, but the customers didn't have the authority to demand her removal. They could have asked to be moved or left quietly.\n"
