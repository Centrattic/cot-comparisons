Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The story is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was being served there. The key points here are the context, the actions taken, and the possible ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the person mentions the woman was very dirty, had a bad cough, and smelled bad. They approached the staff and when the staff didn't remove her, they left. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this objectively.\n\nI should consider several angles. On one hand, everyone has the right to be served in a restaurant, regardless of their appearance or situation. Discriminating against someone based on their homelessness could be seen as unethical. However, the author's concerns about health and safety might be valid, especially if the woman's cough suggested an illness. But is it the restaurant's responsibility to handle such situations?\n\nThe restaurant didn't take any action even when the customers complained. The staff only gave her water. If the restaurant is supposed to handle such situations, then the customers might be within their rights to ask for her removal. But if the restaurant is inclusive and doesn't judge customers, then the authors' actions could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nAnother angle is personal choice. The customers felt uncomfortable and decided to leave. They didn't confront the woman directly but asked the staff. Maybe the restaurant's policy is to serve everyone, so the customers leaving is their choice, but the act of demanding her removal could be seen as rude or judgmental.\n\nAlso, the health aspect: if the woman's cough is a health risk, maybe the customers have a right to be concerned. But unless there's a confirmed illness, it's speculative. The smell and appearance could be due to many reasons, not just a health hazard.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate towards the homeless woman, but if the restaurant didn't address the customers' concerns, they had a choice to leave. The question is whether they are in the wrong for demanding her removal. If the restaurant is open to all, then the authors might be wrong to push for her removal. But if they felt their health was at risk, maybe justified. However, the author's reaction could be influenced by bias. The answer might lean towards A, but I need to balance all factors.\n"
