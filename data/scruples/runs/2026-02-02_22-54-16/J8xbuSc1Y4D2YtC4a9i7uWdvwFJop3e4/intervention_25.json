Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless woman. First, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author and their dad went to a new restaurant. They were enjoying their meal when a homeless woman entered, started coughing, and was visibly unclean. The staff didn't address her presence, and the authors felt uncomfortable enough to confront the staff and eventually leave. The key points here are the health and safety concerns due to her cough, the smell, and the overall discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant was serving a customer, which is their job. The woman might have been there for a legitimate reason, and the staff might not have known she was homeless. The authors' reaction could be seen as discriminatory if they judged her based on her appearance. However, public health concerns are real, especially with a loud cough that could indicate illness.\n\nI have to consider whether the authors' actions were reasonable. If the woman was a health risk, then the authors might have a valid concern. But if they were just uncomfortable because of her appearance, that's different. The story mentions the smell and cough, which are sensory experiences that can affect others. However, demanding her removal could be seen as rude, especially if the staff didn't act on it first. The staff offered an apology and a free roll, but the authors still left. Maybe they could have handled it more politely, but was it their right to demand she leave?\n\nThe answer depends on whether their actions were based on health concerns or prejudice. The story suggests they were genuinely disturbed by her cough and smell, which others might find unpleasant. So, while it's not the most considerate approach, it's not necessarily their fault. They might be in the right if their actions were about health and safety, but if it's just about appearance, they're not. The line between concern and discrimination is thin here.\n"
