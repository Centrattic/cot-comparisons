Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user and their dad went to a new Japanese restaurant. The place was packed, so they sat at the sushi bar. The food was good, and the chef was friendly. Then a homeless woman entered, sat next to them, and started coughing. She was very dirty and had a bad smell. The user says her cough sounded like she had TB. They told the staff to remove her, and when they did, they left without eating the free roll. The question is whether they're the asshole for leaving.\n\nFirst, I should consider the restaurant's policies. Do they have a policy against serving homeless people? The story says the staff didn't do anything initially except bring her water. The user and dad confronted the staff, leading to her removal. So, the staff didn't act until the customers demanded it. That might be a point against the restaurant, but the user's actions led to her removal.\n\nThe user's reasoning is health concerns\u2014she was coughing and smelled bad. They might be worried about hygiene or illness. However, the woman was a customer, and the restaurant has a duty to serve all customers unless there's a valid reason to remove someone. If she was a health risk, maybe the staff should have addressed it. But the user took it upon themselves to demand her removal, which could be seen as discriminatory or rude.\n\nAlso, the user left without eating the free roll. That might seem abrupt, but the story says they lost their appetite. However, making a request to remove someone and then leaving could be seen as holding the restaurant accountable, or as being inconsiderate. It's a balance between respecting their choice and considering the staff's responsibility.\n\nHomelessness is a complex issue, and treating someone with dignity is important. The user's actions might be seen as contributing to stigmatizing homeless individuals. On the other hand, if the person was indeed a health risk, the restaurant should have taken action. The user might have felt they were protecting public health, but the approach could be questioned.\n\nIn terms of restaurant rights, they can ask any customer to leave if they violate policies, but if the woman wasn't causing a disturbance beyond sitting there, the staff's inaction might be a problem. The user stepping in could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Alternatively, maybe the staff was being accommodating because they wanted to help someone in need, and the user was being unreasonable.\n\nI think the key points are: Did the user have a legitimate health concern, or were they reacting to someone's appearance? Were they within their rights to demand her removal? The answer might hinge on whether the restaurant should have handled the situation first. If the staff didn't address the coughing or smell, maybe the user had a right to ask for her removal. But if the staff didn't act, the user's demand could be seen as overstepping. However, the user's main action was leaving, not causing harm. It's a bit of a gray area, but I'm leaning towards the user not being in the wrong because they felt threatened by a potential health risk, even if their approach could be criticized. But I'm not sure. Maybe B is the answer, but I need to check the nuances again.\n"
