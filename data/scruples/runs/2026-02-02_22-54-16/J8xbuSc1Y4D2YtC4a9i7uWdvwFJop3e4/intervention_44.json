Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for leaving the restaurant after a homeless woman was served there. Hmm.\n\nSo the situation is that the person and their dad went to a new sushi place. The place was busy, they were at the bar, and then a homeless woman sat next to them. She was coughing a lot, looked very dirty, and they felt uncomfortable. The staff didn't do anything except give her water. The person and dad told the staff to remove her or they'd leave. The staff did remove her, and they left, not eating the free roll they were given. Now they're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the person. They were in a public restaurant, which is supposed to serve all customers. But the presence of someone who is visibly unwell and unkempt made them uncomfortable. They felt their health was at risk due to the cough and smell. However, the woman was a customer, and the staff didn't remove her initially. The person took it upon themselves to demand her removal, which might be seen as discriminatory or rude.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's responsibility is to serve all patrons, including those in need. The staff gave her water but didn't ask her to leave. The woman might be in a vulnerable situation, and the person's reaction could be seen as contributing to stigma against the homeless. By demanding her removal, they might be violating the restaurant's policy of equal service.\n\nBut then again, the person and their dad were paying customers. If the environment became unsanitary or harmful, they have the right to leave. However, the decision to demand someone's removal isn't typically something customers can enforce. The staff should handle such situations, not the patrons. Also, the act of confronting the staff about another customer's presence could be seen as disrespectful and possibly discriminatory.\n\nIn terms of public health, if someone is coughing persistently, maybe there's a health concern. But making assumptions about her condition might not be fair. The person's reaction was based on appearance and sound, not actual illness. The restaurant's job is to manage such scenarios, maybe by offering a different seating area or providing cleaning supplies, but not necessarily removing a customer.\n\nSo, the person might not be entirely in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable and leaving, but their approach\u2014demanding the removal of another customer\u2014could be problematic. It's a grey area. However, the key point is that the restaurant is a public space where everyone should be welcome unless there's a clear violation of rules. The person's action might have been unnecessary and judgmental, which could make them the asshole here. But if they just left without confronting the staff, that might be different. Since they did confront the staff and demand action, that's where the issue lies.\n"
