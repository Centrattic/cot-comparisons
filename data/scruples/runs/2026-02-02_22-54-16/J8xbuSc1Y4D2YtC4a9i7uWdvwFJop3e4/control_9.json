Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant when they saw a homeless person being served there. The story describes the person as very dirty, coughing, and smelling bad, which made the author and their dad uncomfortable. They demanded the person be removed, and then left after being offered a free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. On one hand, the restaurant is a public place, and everyone should be welcome regardless of their appearance or status. Homeless people deserve to be treated with dignity. The staff didn't ask the woman to leave initially, so maybe the staff thought it was okay. The author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory, making them the \"assholes\" by some standards.\n\nBut on the other hand, the woman was coughing and had a strong smell, which might make others uncomfortable. However, the author's approach was to demand her removal, which could be seen as rude. They didn't ask politely first or consider the woman's situation. The restaurant did offer her water and didn't seem to have a problem with her presence until the customers intervened. \n\nAlso, the author left without eating the free roll, which might be a sign of being upset, but that's their choice. The key point is whether their action was justified. The restaurant's policy might allow all customers, so the author's demand to remove her could be against that policy. Plus, the author's judgment based on appearance is a problem. So, the author is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
