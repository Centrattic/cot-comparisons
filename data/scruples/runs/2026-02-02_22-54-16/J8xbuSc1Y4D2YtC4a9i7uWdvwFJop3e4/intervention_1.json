Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a new restaurant with their dad, and while there, a homeless woman walked in, started coughing a lot, looked very dirty, and they felt uncomfortable. They told the staff to remove her, then left. The author is wondering if they're the asshole (AITA) for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman was homeless, which is a vulnerable group. The restaurant didn't act on her presence initially. The customer felt health concerns due to her cough and smell, so they demanded she be removed. Then they left after being given a free roll. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. But I have to evaluate from different angles. On one hand, the customer might have legitimate health and safety concerns, especially if the cough sounds severe. On the other hand, homeless people are often discriminated against, and the staff didn't intervene first. The customer's reaction could be seen as discriminatory, treating someone unwelcome because of their appearance and condition. \n\nHowever, the restaurant's role is important. If they didn't act to address the situation, maybe the customer felt compelled to. But it's possible that the staff had reasons not to remove her, maybe they were following protocols or trying to be inclusive. The customer's immediate reaction might have been out of fear or discomfort, which isn't the same as being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the health aspect: if the cough was severe, maybe there's a valid concern. But TB is contagious, though not necessarily through casual contact. Still, the perception of risk might influence the customer's decision. \n\nThe answer hinges on balancing health safety concerns versus treating people with dignity. If the customer's actions were based on prejudice, then they might be in the wrong. But if they genuinely felt their health was at risk, it's more complex. However, the act of demanding her removal without knowing the context could be seen as rude and discriminatory. The fact that the restaurant didn't act first might shift some responsibility, but the customer's reaction could still be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction could be viewed as discriminatory and not allowing for the possibility that the woman was a customer with a right to be there. However, some might argue it's about personal comfort and health. But typically, such situations require empathy and understanding, especially towards marginalized groups. Hence, the author's actions might be seen as inappropriate, making them the asshole.\n"
