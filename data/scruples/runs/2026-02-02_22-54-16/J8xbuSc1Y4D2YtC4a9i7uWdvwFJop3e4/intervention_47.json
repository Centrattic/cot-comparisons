Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The key points here are the situation described and the actions taken by the author and their dad.\n\nFirst, the restaurant is in a sketchy area but has good reviews. The author and dad go there, enjoy the food, then a homeless woman enters. She's visibly dirty and coughs a lot, which makes the author uncomfortable. They confront the staff, who then remove her. The author and dad leave, not eating the free roll offered.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author is concerned about hygiene and health because of the woman's cough and smell. But is that a valid reason to demand her removal? On one hand, everyone has the right to access public spaces, including restaurants. Discriminating against someone based on their appearance or homelessness could be considered prejudiced. On the other hand, the author might have been worried about health risks, especially if the cough was severe.\n\nHowever, restaurants typically serve all customers regardless of their background. The staff didn't act immediately, but when the author and dad asked, they complied. The question is whether the authors were in the wrong for making the staff remove her. It's possible that their actions were based on fear or discomfort rather than a legitimate health hazard. Also, leaving because of the situation might be their choice, but demanding the person's removal could be seen as disrespectful to her rights.\n\nAnother angle: the restaurant's responsibility to serve all customers. By allowing the woman to be treated poorly, the staff might have failed in their duty, but the authors' confrontation could be seen as overstepping. However, the authors are customers, and they have the right to request something that affects their dining experience. But the line is thin between asserting their right as customers and being discriminatory.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, the authors might be contributing to marginalizing a homeless person. The story doesn't mention if the woman was a regular or if the restaurant had policies about such situations. If the restaurant routinely serves homeless individuals, then the authors' reaction is problematic. However, if the staff was unprepared for such a situation, their response might be understandable.\n\nUltimately, the authors' decision to leave is their choice, but their demand for the woman's removal could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer hinges on whether their actions were a reasonable request for their own comfort or an unjust demand based on prejudice. Given that the woman was a customer, the authors might be in the wrong for not respecting her right to be served, even if it made them uncomfortable.\n"
