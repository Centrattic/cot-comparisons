Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless woman was served there. They felt uncomfortable because of her appearance and cough, and they demanded she be removed. The restaurant complied, and they left without eating their free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, everyone should have access to food and services regardless of their socioeconomic status. Restaurants are public places, and unless someone is causing harm (like a threat or actual illness), they should be allowed to patronize. The woman wasn't causing a disturbance beyond her appearance and cough, which the author perceived as a health risk. But is that a valid reason?\n\nThe author and their dad felt entitled to demand her removal. That could be seen as discriminatory. However, they did ask the staff to remove her, and the staff acted. The restaurant might have their own policies on such situations, maybe to accommodate homeless individuals, but they chose to comply with the customers' request. \n\nThe author's health concern is mentioned, but unless the woman was visibly ill in a way that's a known health hazard, it's more about personal discomfort. The smell and cough made them lose their appetite, but that's subjective. \n\nIs it the author's fault? They didn't physically harm anyone, but they prioritized their own comfort over someone else's right to be served. Depending on cultural and societal norms, this can be seen as inconsiderate or even discriminatory. However, the restaurant did allow the woman to leave, so maybe the staff handled it. But the act of demanding her removal could be seen as rude or judgmental. \n\nOn the other hand, if the woman was indeed ill and contagious, the restaurant might have had a duty to address that. But the author's perception might not be accurate. The key is whether it was the author's right to demand her removal. Since the staff decided to act, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the act of pressuring the staff to remove her could still be problematic. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they based their action on the woman's appearance and a perceived threat, which could be seen as discriminatory. Restaurants have a responsibility to serve all customers unless there's a clear and present danger. The author's reaction was based on personal discomfort rather than an actual health violation.\n"
