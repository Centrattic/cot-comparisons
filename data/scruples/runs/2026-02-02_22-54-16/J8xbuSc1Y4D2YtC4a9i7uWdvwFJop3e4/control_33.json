Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, which was in a sketchy area but had good reviews. They were at the sushi bar when a homeless woman came in, looked very dirty, coughed a lot, and the restaurant didn't do much except give her water. The author and their dad demanded she be removed, which they were, and then they left without eating the free roll. Now they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the restaurant might be trying to help someone in need, offering a place to sit and a glass of water. The woman might have been seeking shelter or assistance. The author's reaction was based on fear of illness and discomfort from the smell and appearance. They felt their dining experience was ruined and wanted to leave. \n\nBut is demanding someone to be removed for being homeless and unwell unethical? Public places typically have to accommodate all individuals, including homeless people, unless there's a specific health code violation. The woman's cough might be due to illness, but unless she was actively sick or a direct health hazard, asking her to leave could be considered discriminatory. The restaurant's response was minimal, so maybe they didn't have a policy to handle such situations. The author's action might come off as rude or insensitive, prioritizing their own comfort over someone else's need for basic human decency.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about health and safety is understandable, even if it's based on appearance. But in reality, unless there's a clear threat, restaurants can't just kick out someone for being homeless. So the author might have overstepped by making that demand. The answer likely leans towards them being in the wrong (A), but I need to verify if there are any exceptions. If the woman was indeed a health risk, maybe not. But the story doesn't mention any actual contamination or aggression. Just the appearance and cough. \n\nSo, the key points: the act of removing a homeless person without just cause, the use of fear of disease (even if unfounded), and the restaurant's failure to address the situation appropriately. The author's actions could be seen as contributing to the mistreatment of a vulnerable individual. Therefore, the answer is probably A.\n"
