Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they were sitting at the sushi bar. The food was good, and the chef was friendly. Then a homeless woman entered, sat next to them, and had a really bad cough and looked dirty. The restaurant didn't do anything about her, so the person and their dad told them to remove her or they would leave. The staff apologized, escorted her out, and they left without eating the free roll.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong and wants to know if I agree. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: the woman was homeless, looked very dirty, had a severe cough, and the smell was overwhelming. The restaurant didn't initially address the situation, which led the customers to confront them. They left after the woman was removed.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. On one hand, everyone should be treated with dignity, and a homeless person should not be discriminated against. Restaurants have a responsibility to maintain a safe and clean environment for all customers. However, if the person was a health risk (like coughing a lot, possibly contagious), the restaurant might have a duty to address that. But in this case, the staff didn't act until the customers intervened. \n\nThe customers' actions: they asked the restaurant to remove the woman. If the staff didn't act, maybe the customers felt they had to. But is it their responsibility to do so? Or should they have addressed the staff first? Also, the woman's presence might have been a violation of health codes if her condition posed a risk. \n\nHowever, homeless individuals also have rights. The customers might have been reacting out of fear or discomfort, but that doesn't make it right to demand her removal. The restaurant's responsibility is to handle such situations, not the customers. \n\nBut the situation is complex. If the woman was indeed a health hazard, the restaurant should have taken action. The fact that they didn't until the customers demanded it suggests they may have neglected their duty. But the customers' approach\u2014threatening to leave unless she was removed\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. They should perhaps have informed the staff first, or handled it differently, rather than directly demanding her removal.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's argument is that they were protecting their health and the environment. But the restaurant's responsibility is to handle such issues. If the staff didn't act, maybe the customers had a right to be uncomfortable. But using the threat of leaving to force the restaurant to act could be seen as overstepping. On the other hand, if the staff had ignored a health risk, the customers might feel they had to take action.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's discomfort is understandable, but the way they handled it\u2014directly demanding the woman's removal\u2014might not be the right approach. There could have been a more appropriate way to address the issue. However, the restaurant's failure to act also plays a role. So the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there are elements where they could have handled it better. Given the options, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the restaurant's inaction may have contributed, and the customers were trying to protect their health, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
