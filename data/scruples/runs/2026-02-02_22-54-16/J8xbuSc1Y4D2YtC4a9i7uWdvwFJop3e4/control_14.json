Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a new sushi restaurant, which was packed, and a homeless woman with a bad cough and dirty appearance was served there. The author and their dad told the staff to remove her or they would leave. The restaurant did remove her, and they left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is whether it's acceptable to ask for a homeless person to be removed from a restaurant based on their appearance and health symptoms. From a social justice perspective, people have the right to access public spaces, including restaurants, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Discriminating against someone for being homeless could be seen as unethical. The restaurant's policy should be to serve everyone, unless there's a specific violation of rules like causing a disturbance or a health hazard.\n\nHowever, the author and their dad were concerned about the cough, which they associated with TB. Public health considerations might come into play here if the person was genuinely a health risk. But TB isn't easily transmitted in public, and the staff didn't take any action, just brought water. That suggests the restaurant didn't see an immediate health threat, and the author's reaction might have been based on a misunderstanding or fear.\n\nAlso, the fact that the restaurant was in a \"sketchy\" part of town might imply that they're accustomed to serving a diverse clientele, including homeless individuals. The author's decision to leave could be seen as a form of ableism or classism, which is definitely problematic. They might be judging the woman based on her appearance and health, which are not valid reasons to exclude someone from a public space. \n\nBut there's another angle: the author felt physically uncomfortable and even lost their appetite. That's a personal feeling, and people can't be expected to tolerate all situations. However, the way they handled it\u2014demanding the person be removed and then leaving\u2014could be considered rude or discriminatory. The staff did apologize and give a free roll, which shows they acknowledged the request, but the act of making the staff remove someone just because of their appearance is where the problem lies.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's generally considered inappropriate to make demands about other patrons based on prejudice. The author should have focused on their own discomfort without trying to eject someone else. They could have asked for a different seat or left quietly, but not demanded the staff to remove the woman. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were probably inconsiderate and discriminatory. The restaurant's responsibility is to accommodate all customers unless there's a clear violation. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong, which is option A.\n"
