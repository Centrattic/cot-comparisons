Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went to a new restaurant with their dad. They loved the food and atmosphere, but then a woman who looked homeless and was coughing entered. The author felt uncomfortable, so they told the staff they'd leave unless the woman was removed. The staff did remove her, and the author left even after being offered a free roll. Now, they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points here are the actions of the author and the context. The woman was homeless, which immediately makes this a sensitive issue. The author's reaction was based on the woman's appearance and the cough, which they found disturbing. They confronted the staff, leading to her removal. \n\nIs it wrong to be concerned about hygiene and health? Well, if someone is coughing heavily and appears very unclean, others might be worried about health risks. However, the restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, including those in difficult circumstances. The staff didn't seem to take action initially, but after the author's request, they did remove her. \n\nBut here's the thing: asking the staff to remove a customer can be seen as discriminatory if it's based on their appearance or socio-economic status. The author's main complaint was about the woman's presence, which might imply they didn't want to be in the same space as someone homeless. That could be considered judgmental or prejudiced. \n\nOn the other hand, people do have the right to feel uncomfortable in certain situations. If there was a legitimate health concern (like the coughing possibly being contagious), the author might have a point. However, assuming the worst (like TB) without evidence might not be justified. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction was to demand the person's removal, which is a strong action. The restaurant's response was to comply, which might indicate they were concerned about other customers' comfort. But is it right for the customer to push for someone else to be removed? That's a gray area. \n\nIn terms of ethics, treating people with dignity is important. The woman might have been having a hard time and just trying to get a meal. The author's actions could be seen as contributing to stigma against homeless individuals. However, the author also mentions losing their appetite and being physically uncomfortable, which is a valid personal reaction. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's debatable. On one side, they acted based on their discomfort and possibly a concern for health, but on the other side, it might reflect a lack of empathy or discrimination. The restaurant's staff's inaction initially might not have been right, but the author's demand for removal could be seen as taking the matter into their own hands. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were appropriate in the context of public accommodation and anti-discrimination policies. Public places are supposed to serve all people, and customers don't have the right to demand that others be removed based on their appearance. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for pressuring the staff to eject the woman. However, the situation is complex because the woman's condition might have posed a health concern. \n\nBut the story says that the staff didn't do anything except bring her water, and after the author's request, they did remove her. The staff's action could be seen as prioritizing customer comfort over a homeless person's right to a meal. But the author's role in that is questionable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might not be in line with treating all people equally. While they had a right to leave, demanding the removal of another customer based on their appearance could be considered wrong. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because there are valid points on both sides.\n"
