Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant when they saw a homeless woman who was coughing and dirty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant was in a sketchy area but had great reviews. The couple went there and had a good experience until the woman entered. The woman looked very unclean, was coughing, and the smell was overwhelming. The person and their dad asked the restaurant to remove her, which they did, and then they left. The author isn't sure if they're at fault.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, there's a debate here. On one hand, the woman might be in need of help, and the couple's reaction could be seen as discriminatory. They might have made an assumption about her health or cleanliness without knowing her situation. Also, asking to be removed from the restaurant could be seen as insensitive, especially if the woman was a customer too. Restaurants can't just evict someone unless there's a specific reason like causing a disturbance, which the woman might not have been doing beyond being unwell.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple felt physically ill and unsafe due to the cough and smell. It's understandable that they wanted to leave, especially if they were concerned about health risks. The restaurant did apologize and offer compensation, which suggests they might have been aware of the situation and handled it, but the couple still left. Their decision could be based on personal discomfort rather than any fault of the woman's. However, the act of demanding her removal could be seen as contributing to the marginalization of homeless individuals.\n\nI also need to consider if the couple had the right to demand she be removed. Unless there was a hygiene code or the woman was causing a disturbance, the restaurant might not have been obligated to act. The couple's reaction might have been overstepping their authority as customers. \n\nIn terms of social responsibility, there's a balance between personal comfort and respecting others. While the couple's actions were driven by their own discomfort, they might have acted in a way that was judgmental or lacked empathy. It's possible they could have considered that the woman was there for the same reason they were\u2014perhaps seeking a meal, and her appearance and cough might be due to circumstances beyond her control.\n\nSo, putting this together, the answer might lean towards the couple being in the wrong (A) because their action of demanding removal could be seen as discriminatory. However, some may argue they had a right to leave due to their personal discomfort. But the act of insisting on her removal might be where they crossed a line. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
