Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves a homeless woman with a bad cough and poor hygiene who was served at the restaurant. The author and their dad confronted the staff, leading to her being escorted out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author acted appropriately by demanding the woman be removed. The restaurant is in a sketchy area, and the reviews were good, so maybe they expected a certain standard. However, the woman's presence might be a matter of the restaurant's policy on serving all customers regardless of their situation.\n\nThe author mentions the woman's cough, which they thought was severe, and her appearance was very dirty. They felt uncomfortable and left. But is it fair to judge the woman's health based on her appearance? Also, the staff didn't remove her initially, which might mean the restaurant has a policy to serve everyone. The author's reaction might be seen as discriminatory if the woman was a customer, but if the restaurant isn't enforcing hygiene standards, maybe that's on the establishment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author and their dad were paying customers. If the woman's presence was making them uncomfortable and affecting their dining experience, maybe they had a right to express that. However, confronting the staff directly and threatening to leave could be seen as aggressive, especially if the restaurant was following their own policies.\n\nAnother angle is the restaurant's responsibility. They should ensure all customers are treated with respect and maintain a safe environment. If the woman was a regular and they knew about her condition, maybe they should have addressed it differently. But if the author is making assumptions about her health (like TB) based on her cough, that's not fair. Also, her hygiene could be a concern, but that's not the same as a health risk unless she's visibly ill in a way that endangers others.\n\nLegally, restaurants can't discriminate against homeless people. So if the restaurant allowed her in, they have a duty to serve her unless she's causing a disturbance. The author's action might be seen as infringing on the woman's rights. However, if the woman was a threat to others' health, maybe the restaurant had a valid reason to remove her, but the author's judgment of her health might be incorrect.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, the author might be showing a lack of empathy. The woman could be homeless and struggling, and the author's reaction might reflect stigma. But the author also has the right to feel uncomfortable and leave. It's a balance between personal comfort and social responsibility.\n\nThe answer isn't straightforward. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they left after confronting the staff, but their initial judgment of the woman's health and their demand to remove her could be problematic. The restaurant's failure to address the situation before the customers intervened might be an issue too. So, it's a nuanced case where both sides have points. However, according to the options, the answer is A or B. Since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh the ethical aspects. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate towards the homeless woman and her rights to service, so maybe A (author is in the wrong). But if the restaurant's policies allowed serving her, then the author's reaction might be justified. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B, but I'm not 100% sure.\n"
