Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant when they saw a homeless person being served. Hmm. So the situation is that the author and their dad went to a new sushi place. The place was packed, they were at the bar, everything was good. Then a homeless-looking woman came in, coughed a lot, looked really dirty, and the staff didn't do anything. The author and dad demanded she be removed, which they were, and then the author left without eating the free roll. Now they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author felt uncomfortable and unwell due to the homeless woman's appearance and coughing. They might have been worried about health risks. On the other hand, homeless people also have rights to access public spaces, including restaurants, unless they're causing a disturbance. The staff didn't remove her initially, which might mean they didn't see a problem. The author's demand could be seen as discriminatory or judgmental.\n\nBut wait, the woman was coughing a lot. Maybe there were health concerns. Though, unless she was actually ill and contagious, it's hard to say. The author might have been overreacting. Also, the staff did give her water, so maybe they were handling it. The author's immediate reaction to leave after the woman was removed might be seen as them prioritizing their own comfort over the restaurant's effort to serve everyone. However, they did leave when they felt unwell, which could be understandable. The question is whether their actions were justified.\n\nI think the key points are: requesting the staff to remove someone who's not causing a disturbance could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's reaction might be based on prejudice against homeless people. But if the coughing was disturbing the dining experience, maybe they had a reason. However, it's possible that the restaurant should handle such situations without customer intervention. So the author might be in the wrong for demanding her removal, as the staff didn't act before, implying she wasn't violating any rules. Thus, the answer might be A.\n"
