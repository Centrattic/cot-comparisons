Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who left a restaurant because they saw a homeless person being served there. The key points to consider are the actions of the author, the context, and whether their reaction is justified.\n\nFirst, the author went to a new restaurant with their dad, which was packed. They were at the sushi bar when a homeless-looking woman sat next to them. The woman had a bad cough and was very dirty. The author and dad told the staff to remove her, which they did, then the authors left without eating the free roll.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether it's wrong to ask for a homeless person to be removed from a restaurant. Restaurants are public spaces and should serve all customers. However, the woman might have had a contagious cough, which is a health concern. But the staff didn't act on that, so the authors took it upon themselves to demand her removal. \n\nHomeless people have the right to be served in public places. However, if someone is a health risk, maybe the restaurant has policies. But the staff didn't address the cough, so perhaps the authors felt they had to act. However, asking for someone to be removed because of their appearance and health status could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nOn the other hand, the authors were concerned about their health and well-being. The smell and coughing made them uncomfortable, and they lost their appetite. It's a balance between respecting others' rights and personal discomfort. \n\nThe restaurant might have a policy against serving someone who's unwell, but the staff didn't remove her initially. The authors' action could be seen as overstepping, as it's the restaurant's responsibility to manage such situations. But they might have felt justified in protecting their health.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's generally inappropriate to demand that a staff member remove another customer unless there's a clear violation of the restaurant's rules. The authors' approach might have been rude and discriminatory. However, their health concerns are valid. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the authors likely acted inconsiderately. They should have addressed their concerns with the staff first rather than making a demand. The right to service for all individuals should be upheld, even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but there's nuance here.\n"
