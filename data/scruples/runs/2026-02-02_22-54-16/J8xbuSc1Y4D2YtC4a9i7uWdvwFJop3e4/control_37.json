Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a new sushi restaurant, which was packed, and a homeless woman with a bad cough and dirty appearance was served. The user and their dad demanded she be removed, and when she was, they left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant is in a \"sketchy part of town,\" but the reviews were good. The woman was a customer, not a staff member. She was coughing, which the user found alarming, and she was visibly unclean. The user felt that their health was at risk and decided to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here. Homelessness is a complex issue, and people experiencing it often face stigma and discrimination. The restaurant serving all customers regardless of their background is a positive action. However, the user's reaction is based on fear of illness (TB-like cough) and discomfort from the smell. They didn't approach the situation with empathy but rather demanded ejection.\n\nWas the user's action wrong? Well, they didn't ask for her to be removed politely; instead, they made an ultimatum. The restaurant didn't initially address her situation, maybe because they were busy. The user's primary concern seems to be their own discomfort and perceived health risk rather than the woman's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, if the woman was indeed ill, she might have a right to receive services if she's a paying customer. The staff brought her water but didn't interact more, which might be a failure on their part, but the user's response was to escalate the situation. The smell and cough could be signs of a health issue, but the user didn't offer help or ask if she needed anything. They just wanted her gone to preserve their dining experience.\n\nSo, the user's actions come off as inconsiderate and discriminatory against a homeless person. Even if they felt unwell, the appropriate response would be to inform the staff or management, not to threaten to leave. The fact that the restaurant didn't serve her in a different way but the user did is a problem. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
