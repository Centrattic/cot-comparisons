Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person and their dad went to a new restaurant. It was crowded, so they sat at the sushi bar. The food was good, but then a homeless-looking woman entered and sat next to them. She had a bad cough and looked very dirty. They told the staff to remove her, which they did. Then the couple left, even though the chef apologized and gave them free food.\n\nNow, the question is whether they were in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the person argues that the woman looked very unwell and dirty, and they felt disgusted. They asked the staff to remove her, which they did. They left because they lost their appetite. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant was serving a homeless person, which they might have known when they chose to go there. The woman was a customer, and the staff had a duty to serve her unless she was causing a disturbance. By demanding her removal, the customer is interfering with the restaurant's service. Also, the woman might have been in need of help, and the couple's reaction could be seen as discriminatory or insensitive.\n\nBut then, people have the right to choose not to associate with others. If someone is making them uncomfortable, can they request that a person be removed? Wait, unless the person is causing a disturbance or violating health codes, the restaurant isn't obligated to remove them. The woman wasn't causing a disturbance beyond her presence, unless her coughing was disruptive. However, the couple assumed she was sick, which might not be fair. \n\nAlso, the couple's actions could be seen as using their privilege to demand that the restaurant accommodate their discomfort, which might not be the restaurant's responsibility. The staff did give her water and allowed her to stay until asked to remove her. The restaurant might have policies against such actions by customers. \n\nIn terms of social responsibility, choosing to support a restaurant in a sketchy area might mean accepting a diverse clientele. The couple's decision to leave might be their right, but their initial demand to remove the woman could be problematic. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did ask to have a customer removed, which might not be their place. However, they left after that. The restaurant's staff did remove her upon request, but that might not have been appropriate. The couple's main issue was their reaction to a homeless person, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. In many cases, people have the right to refuse service to others, but customers don't have the right to demand that others be removed unless there's a valid reason. Since the woman wasn't causing a disturbance, the couple's request might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong). However, the line is blurry. If the woman was a health risk, that's different, but TB is not something that's easily transmitted through coughing in public without confirmation. The couple's assumption might not be valid. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions could be seen as discriminatory and using their privilege to demand the removal of a homeless person. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
