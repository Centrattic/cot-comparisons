Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves a family going to a new restaurant, which is in a sketchy area but has good reviews. They're at the sushi bar, having a good time, when a homeless woman enters. She's coughing, dirty, and the family feels uncomfortable. They demand she be removed, which the staff does, and then the family leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main question is whether it's acceptable to ask a staff to remove someone based on their appearance and health condition. The homeless woman is clearly in a vulnerable state. Her coughing and smell are causing discomfort, but is that a valid reason to demand her removal?\n\nThere are a few angles to consider. From the author's perspective, they were uncomfortable and felt their health was at risk. However, restaurants are public spaces and should serve everyone, regardless of their appearance or social status. The staff didn't seem to have a problem with her presence initially, only acting when the author and dad demanded it. That suggests the restaurant might have policies against discrimination or serving all customers.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were within their rights to request removal of someone they felt was a health hazard. But in reality, unless there's a legal issue (like a contagious disease that's a public health concern), it's not up to patrons to decide who can or cannot be served. The staff should handle such situations, perhaps by offering assistance if the woman is in need, rather than ejecting her based on appearance.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory. They judged someone based on their appearance and health, which might be a form of prejudice. The fact that the staff didn't object initially and only acted when asked implies that the restaurant was willing to serve her, and the decision to remove her was made by the customers, not the staff based on any policy.\n\nMoreover, the author's immediate reaction\u2014leaving and not eating the complimentary roll\u2014might indicate that their main issue wasn't health but discomfort with the person's presence. The smell and coughing could be genuine concerns, but in a public place, people have to tolerate a range of situations. The restaurant's responsibility is to ensure a safe environment, not necessarily a comfortable one for all patrons.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is in a position of privilege. They can choose to leave, but the homeless woman might not have that option. Their actions could contribute to a culture where vulnerable people are excluded from public spaces. The restaurant's response\u2014apologizing and giving a free item\u2014might also suggest they felt bad about the situation but complied with the customers' demands, which could set a precedent for future incidents.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because their reaction was based on prejudice and they didn't consider the restaurant's duty to serve everyone. They had the power to leave but their actions contributed to the exclusion of someone in need. The answer would be A (they are in the wrong) because their behavior was discriminatory and they overstepped their role as customers.\n"
