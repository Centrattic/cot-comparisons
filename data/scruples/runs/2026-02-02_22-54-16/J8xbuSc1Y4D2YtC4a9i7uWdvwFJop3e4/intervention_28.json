Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about leaving a restaurant after they served a homeless person. The key points here are the author's actions and the potential impact on others.\n\nFirst, the restaurant served a homeless woman who was visibly ill and unkempt. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable and decided to confront the staff, leading to the woman being escorted out. The author left the restaurant afterward. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author might feel that their health and comfort were at risk due to the woman's cough and smell. On the other hand, the restaurant might have been providing service to someone in need, which is a positive action. \n\nBut, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reaction might be seen as discriminatory if they are treating the homeless person differently. However, the woman was coughing and had a strong odor, which could be a legitimate health concern. \n\nAlso, the restaurant's responsibility includes maintaining hygiene and safety. If the staff didn't take action before the customers did, maybe they were at fault. The author's confrontation might be justified if the restaurant wasn't addressing the issue. \n\nBut maybe the author overreacted. Even if the woman was unwell, the customers have the right to request that the restaurant handle the situation. However, demanding her removal could be seen as treating her poorly. \n\nI think the key is the restaurant's role here. If they didn't act first, the customers might feel compelled to. However, the act of confronting the staff and causing the woman to be removed could be seen as inconsiderate towards her. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they were prioritizing their own comfort and health, especially if the restaurant didn't intervene. But there's a balance between personal comfort and compassion for others. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they were acting on their own health concerns and the restaurant didn't take action. However, there's a nuance in how they handled it. Maybe they could have been more empathetic, but the core issue is the restaurant's responsibility.\n"
