Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was being served there, even though the restaurant didn't do anything wrong. The person felt uncomfortable because the woman was coughing and dirty, and they demanded she be removed. The restaurant complied, but the user is now questioning if they were being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications here. The restaurant served a homeless person, which is a positive action, promoting inclusivity and providing service to all. However, the user felt that the presence of this woman, who was visibly unwell and dirty, posed a health risk or was unsanitary. But is that a valid reason?\n\nHealth and safety regulations usually require that any individual who is a health risk be addressed. However, the situation isn't clear if the woman was actually a risk. Just coughing and appearing dirty doesn't necessarily mean she's contagious or violating hygiene laws. The user's reaction might be based on appearance rather than any actual threat.\n\nThen there's the aspect of social responsibility. Choosing to serve all customers is a business decision that can reflect on the restaurant's values. The staff didn't remove her initially, which might indicate they didn't find her a threat. When the customers complained, the staff then removed her. The customers' demand could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over the restaurant's values, but maybe they had concerns about health.\n\nHowever, the user's approach was confrontational. They stood up and gave an ultimatum. That's a strong action. Was it reasonable to expect the restaurant to remove her based on their perception? Also, the user left immediately without considering other options, like moving tables or waiting for her to be served and leave on her own.\n\nOn the flip side, if the woman's health was genuinely causing a problem, the restaurant should have taken action. But since they only gave her water and didn't intervene, it's possible they didn't see an immediate issue. The user's reaction might have been overzealous, using a health concern as a pretext for discrimination against the homeless.\n\nThe question is whether the user's actions were justified. If the restaurant had a duty to ensure health and safety, then maybe the user had a point. But if the restaurant is operating within the law and standards, then the user might be in the wrong for pressuring them to remove a customer based on personal discomfort. Also, the user's comment about her possibly having TB could be fear-mongering without evidence.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably A. The user is in the wrong because they reacted impulsively and possibly discriminately, without evidence of a health risk. They should have handled the situation more respectfully, maybe by politely asking to move or contacting management privately instead of making a public demand to remove a patron.\n"
