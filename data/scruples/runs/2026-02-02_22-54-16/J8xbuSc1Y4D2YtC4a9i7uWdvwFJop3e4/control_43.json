Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves a new sushi restaurant with great reviews in a sketchy area. They go there with their dad, the food is good, but then a homeless-looking woman enters, coughs, has a bad smell, and the family demands she be removed. The staff complies, offers a free roll, but they leave anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The woman is homeless, which often comes with societal stigmas and biases. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable because of her appearance, cough, and smell. They confronted the staff, leading to her being asked to leave. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, treating someone with dignity and compassion is important. Homeless individuals are often already marginalized, and the restaurant serving them could be seen as a kind gesture. The family's reaction might be based on fear or prejudice. However, the author's health concerns due to the cough and smell might be a valid reason to ask to leave, especially if they feel physically unwell. But the main issue is whether the restaurant was in the wrong for serving her. The staff didn't interact with her beyond bringing water, and the family's demand to remove her could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nIn terms of restaurant policy, establishments can set their own rules, but if they serve the public, they can't legally discriminate against certain people. However, if the person is a health or safety risk, that's different. The author claims the cough sounded like TB and the smell was overwhelming. But TB is contagious through the air, not just coughing, and the smell might be due to poor hygiene, which isn't uncommon for someone without stable housing. \n\nThe family's immediate demand to remove her might have been abrupt and lacking empathy. The staff apologized and tried to make it right by giving a free roll, but the family still left. This could be seen as punitive and inconsiderate. On the other hand, if the environment made them so uncomfortable that they couldn't enjoy their meal, leaving might be a personal choice, but the way they handled it could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering both the legal and ethical angles, the family's actions might be viewed as inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory. They didn't consider that the person was a customer being served, and their reaction was based on appearance and health concerns without evidence. The restaurant's response was to apologize and offer a free item, which is reasonable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing the homeless person to be in the restaurant, as they didn't pose a direct threat and the family's reaction was based on bias rather than actual danger.\n"
