Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because a homeless person was served there. The situation is presented as a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author went to a restaurant with their dad, had a good experience, but then a homeless woman entered, looked dirty, had a bad cough, and wasn't cleaned up. The staff didn't do anything except bring her water. The author and dad demanded she be removed, which happened, and they left, citing loss of appetite. \n\nNow, considering the moral and ethical aspects. On one hand, the author is justified in being uncomfortable around someone who appears very ill and possibly unclean, which could be a health or hygiene concern. The staff didn't address the situation, so the customers felt they had to take action. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman might be a patron with the right to be in the restaurant. The act of demanding she leave could be seen as discriminatory or rude. The restaurant's responsibility is to maintain a safe and comfortable environment for all customers, but the staff's inaction might indicate they had their own policies or couldn't evict someone without cause. \n\nIn many places, people can't be denied service unless they're violating specific rules (like causing a disturbance). The woman's presence alone isn't a reason to remove her. The author's decision to leave after confrontation might be seen as their right, but the initial demand for her removal could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's health concern is valid, but the approach might have been more tactful. Perhaps they could have asked the staff to address the situation first, instead of directly confronting it. However, the staff didn't act, so the customers might feel compelled to do so. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, being rude to a staff member or a fellow customer is generally frowned upon. However, the author's primary reason was health and safety, which can be a legitimate concern. The line between standing up for one's comfort and being inconsiderate is blurry here. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and individual perspectives. Some would say the author is justified in protecting themselves from a perceived health risk, while others might argue that the staff should handle such situations and that the author's actions were unwarranted. \n\nThe key points are: the staff didn't act, the woman's condition was concerning, and the author's action led to her removal. The author left, but their initial confrontation could be seen as overstepping. However, given the staff's inaction, maybe the author wasn't wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because they were trying to protect themselves and their dad from a potentially unhealthy situation. The staff's failure to address it might have forced them to take action. However, the approach could have been better, but the outcome was the woman being removed, which the restaurant did comply with. So the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
