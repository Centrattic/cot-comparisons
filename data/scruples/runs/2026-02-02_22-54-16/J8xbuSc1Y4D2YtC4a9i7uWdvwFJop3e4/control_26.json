Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who left the restaurant was in the wrong. The scenario involves a homeless woman being served there, which led the author and their dad to demand her removal and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant was serving a homeless person, which some might see as commendable, as it's a way to help those in need. However, the woman was very unclean, coughing, and had a bad smell. The customers felt uncomfortable and demanded she be removed. The restaurant complied, then the customers left despite an apology and a free roll.\n\nThe ethical angle here is tricky. On one hand, restaurants have the right to serve anyone unless there's a health violation. Serving homeless people is a kind act, and the staff didn't seem to have a problem with her presence initially. The customers' reaction might be seen as judgmental or discriminatory, as they judged the woman based on her appearance and hygiene, which might not be under her control.\n\nOn the other hand, health and safety concerns are valid. If someone is coughing severely, it could be a health risk, especially in enclosed spaces. However, the customers didn't report her to the management for health reasons but rather for discomfort. The restaurant staff didn't act on her presence until the customers intervened, which could indicate they didn't see her as a threat.\n\nAnother angle is the social responsibility aspect. Choosing to leave because of a homeless person being present could be seen as contributing to stigma and exclusion. However, the customers might genuinely feel that their health is at risk, even if it's more about personal discomfort than actual danger.\n\nThe fact that the restaurant gave an apology and a free roll suggests they recognized the customer's discomfort, but that doesn't necessarily justify leaving. The question is whether the customers had the right to demand her removal. Legally, unless the woman was violating health codes (which isn't stated), the restaurant could serve her. So the customers' demand was based on their own standards, not legal grounds.\n\nIn terms of ethics, being considerate of others' comfort is important, but so is compassion towards the homeless. The customers' actions might be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over someone in need. However, one could argue that if someone is visibly unwell and causing distress, it's reasonable to ask for intervention, though not necessarily the removal of the person.\n\nThe line between being considerate and being intolerant is thin here. The customers might not be in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but their decision to leave after demanding her removal could be seen as selfish, especially if the restaurant was accommodating her out of goodwill.\n\nIn summary, while the customers' actions were based on their discomfort and health concerns, they might be in the wrong for judging the homeless woman and not considering the restaurant's role in serving all customers. The ethical stance would lean towards not being in the wrong because they acted on their discomfort, but socially, it's a negative action. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the restaurant was within their rights to serve her, the customers' demand for removal and leaving without considering the broader context might make them in the wrong.\n"
