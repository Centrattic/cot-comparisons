Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The scenario involves a person who feels uncomfortable due to the appearance and cough of a homeless woman. The key points here are the author's actions and the context.\n\nFirst, the restaurant allowed the homeless woman to enter, which is their right unless they're causing a disturbance. The author and their dad asked the staff to remove her, which could be seen as pressuring the restaurant to exclude someone. The staff eventually did remove her, but the authors left in protest. \n\nNow, considering the right to refuse service. While businesses can ask someone to leave if they're disruptive, the woman was there and only got coughing. The authors might have overstepped by demanding her removal. Also, the authors left without eating the free roll, which could be seen as a hasty reaction. \n\nHowever, the authors were concerned about health and safety. The coughing and smell might have made them uncomfortable, but that's more about personal sensitivity. The restaurant might have a responsibility to ensure a safe and clean environment for all patrons. But the authors didn't give the staff a chance to address the situation first; they immediately threatened to leave. \n\nThere's also the aspect of treating people with dignity. The authors' actions could be seen as discriminatory towards the homeless. The woman's appearance and coughing might be due to circumstances beyond her control, not malice. The authors' response might come off as insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, if the staff didn't address the situation, maybe the authors felt they had no choice. But in a restaurant, it's the staff's job to handle such issues. The authors' demand to remove her could be seen as overreaching, especially if she wasn't actually violating any rules. \n\nIn terms of societal responsibility, the authors might have acted out of fear or discomfort, but that doesn't justify their actions. The restaurant might have policies to handle such situations, and the authors' interference could be seen as undermining the restaurant's management. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the authors might be in the wrong because they didn't give the staff proper time to address the issue and instead made demands leading to the woman's removal. Their actions could be seen as discriminatory and unnecessary, based on the woman's appearance and health without evidence of a direct threat.\n"
