Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, and a homeless woman with a bad cough and poor hygiene was served. The author and their dad demanded she be removed, and when she was, they left without eating the free food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, the restaurant is a public space where everyone is supposed to be welcome. Turning away a customer, even someone homeless, could be seen as discriminatory. The staff didn't remove her initially, which might suggest they tried to accommodate her. But the author felt physically sick and unsafe due to health concerns.\n\nBut wait, the person was a customer. The staff served her water but didn't remove her. The author and dad approached them, maybe out of concern for health. But was it the restaurant's responsibility to handle that? If the person was a health hazard, maybe the staff should have taken action. However, the author didn't report her for health code violations but instead demanded her removal. That could be seen as being rude or discriminatory. The author left without eating, but the free roll was offered as an apology. \n\nOn the other side, the author's health and comfort are valid. If the cough was severe, like TB, that's a real health risk. However, assuming she had TB without evidence might be jumping to conclusions. Also, the smell and appearance could be due to circumstances beyond her control. \n\nSo, the question is whether their actions were justified. Was it okay to ask the restaurant to remove her, or was that being judgmental? Also, the author might be inconsiderate of the homeless person's situation. But they were there to enjoy their meal and felt their experience was ruined. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong if they genuinely felt health concerns, but their approach could be seen as harsh. However, the restaurant might have protocols for such situations. Since they left after the woman was escorted out, maybe they were justified in prioritizing their health. So I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong), but there's some nuance.\n"
