Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The author and their dad went to a new sushi place, which was packed. A homeless woman with a severe cough sat next to them. They asked the restaurant to remove her, which they did, and then the author left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman was visibly sick and dirty, causing discomfort. The restaurant employees didn't seem to address her presence initially, just gave her water. The authors felt their health was at risk and couldn't continue enjoying their meal.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a balance between empathy for the homeless and the right to a safe environment. The authors might be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over helping someone in need. However, their reaction could also be justified by concerns about hygiene and health, especially with a severe cough that sounds like a contagious illness.\n\nLegally, restaurants can ask people to leave if they pose a health risk or disrupt the business. The restaurant did remove her, so maybe they followed policy. The authors' immediate reaction to leave after that might be seen as a personal choice, but some might argue that they should have stayed and given the restaurant a chance to handle the situation without confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the authors didn't attack the woman or the staff, just asked for her removal and left. They did receive an apology and compensation, which shows the restaurant acknowledged their discomfort. However, the key issue is whether their actions were inconsiderate towards the homeless person. Homeless individuals often face stigma, and their presence in a restaurant shouldn't be a reason for others to leave. The authors might be in the wrong for not considering the woman's situation and the restaurant's responsibility to serve all customers.\n\nBut considering the health concern, if the woman's cough was truly alarming, the authors had a right to feel unsafe. Public health guidelines suggest that people with contagious illnesses should avoid public places. If the restaurant didn't enforce that, maybe they're at fault. However, the authors didn't report the situation to authorities but demanded removal themselves.\n\nIn summary, there's a conflict between personal discomfort and social responsibility. The authors might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their health, but they could have handled it more compassionately, perhaps by leaving without confrontation or donating money to the restaurant to help the woman's cause.\n"
