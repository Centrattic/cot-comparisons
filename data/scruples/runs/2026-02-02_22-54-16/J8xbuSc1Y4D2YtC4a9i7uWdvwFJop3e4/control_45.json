Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person and their dad leaving a restaurant because a homeless woman with a severe cough was being served there. The author insists they were just about to order more when the situation became unbearable, leading them to demand the staff remove the woman. The restaurant complied, but they left without eating the free roll given as compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The homeless woman is a vulnerable individual. The restaurant staff allowed her to stay, perhaps as an act of kindness or part of their policy to serve everyone regardless of their circumstances. The customers, the author and their dad, felt uncomfortable and demanded her removal. That raises the question of whether they have the right to dictate who can be served in a public space.\n\nOn one hand, the author's concern about potential illness (TB-sounding cough, bad smell) is understandable. People do have health concerns, especially in places where food is served. However, the woman was a customer, and it's not up to other customers to decide who can be present. The staff's decision to escort her out might have been a compromise, but the fact that the customers felt empowered to demand that action is problematic.\n\nThen there's the aspect of empathy and social responsibility. Homeless individuals often face discrimination and exclusion. By demanding her removal, the author might be contributing to that marginalization. It's important to consider whether the action was based on genuine health concerns or just discomfort with someone's appearance and circumstances.\n\nAlso, the restaurant's response is a point to consider. They apologized and gave a free roll, which might indicate they felt bad about the situation. The fact that the author left without eating the free roll could be seen as them being inconsiderate of the staff's attempt to make amends.\n\nHowever, there's another angle: public health. If someone is indeed ill, there might be legitimate health and safety concerns. But the staff would be the ones responsible for assessing that. The customers shouldn't be making that judgment. The author's reaction could be seen as overstepping their role as a customer.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while some people might empathize with the author's discomfort, demanding someone be removed based on their appearance and perceived health status is generally frowned upon unless there's a clear and present danger. The line between personal discomfort and legitimate health and safety issues is thin here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory. They assumed the role of enforcing the restaurant's policies, which isn't their place. The restaurant's staff should handle such situations, not individual customers. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
