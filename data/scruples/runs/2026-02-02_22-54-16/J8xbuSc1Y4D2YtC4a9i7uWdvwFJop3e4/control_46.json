Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user wants to know if the person who left the restaurant is in the wrong. The scenario involves a homeless woman with a bad cough and odor being served at a new sushi restaurant. The person and their dad felt uncomfortable, asked the staff to remove her, and ultimately left after receiving an apology and a free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman appeared very sick and unkempt, which made the diners uncomfortable. The staff initially didn't address her condition, but when the diners complained, they removed her. The question is whether the diners were wrong in their actions.\n\nLegally, a business can ask someone to leave if they pose a health or safety risk. If the woman was coughing and had a strong odor, maybe there's a legitimate concern about spreading illness. However, it's also important to consider that the homeless have rights, and businesses can't discriminate based on appearance alone. But if the staff didn't act initially, maybe the diners felt justified in speaking up. However, using the threat of leaving to make the staff remove someone might be seen as pressuring them, especially if the staff didn't see a problem.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the diners were being inconsiderate, using the woman's appearance and health as a reason to leave. Others might say they had the right to request her removal for their comfort and safety, especially if they perceived a health risk. The staff's apology and action to remove her might indicate they agreed there was an issue, but it's also possible they were just accommodating the complaint.\n\nAnother angle: The restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, unless someone is a threat. If the woman wasn't causing a disturbance beyond her appearance and health, the staff might not have had a reason to eject her. The diners might have overstepped by demanding her removal. However, the staff did comply, so maybe there was an underlying reason to act.\n\nThe smell and coughing could be signs of illness, which is a legitimate health concern. In some places, businesses can ask someone to leave if they pose a risk to others. But the line is blurry. It's possible the staff didn't act because they didn't see a direct threat, but when asked, they did. The diners might have been in the right to request her removal if they felt she was a health hazard.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the woman was just a regular customer who happened to be homeless and sick, and the diners made an assumption without knowing. The staff's initial inaction might mean they didn't see an immediate issue. Pressuring the staff to remove her could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI need to weigh these points. The answer hinges on whether the diners had a valid reason to request her removal. If the cough and odor presented a health risk, maybe they were justified. But if it was just about discomfort with her appearance, then they might be in the wrong. The staff's response is mixed\u2014they did remove her after the request, which might suggest they agreed there was an issue. Alternatively, they might have complied to avoid losing a customer.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. However, using appearance and health to demand removal might cross into being judgmental, especially if there's no proof of a health risk. The diners might have thought they were protecting their health, but their actions could be seen as discriminatory. I'm leaning towards them being in the wrong because they used the threat of leaving to influence the staff's decision, which could be seen as bullying. But there's a chance they were acting in self-protection. Given the ambiguity, but considering the restaurant's initial inaction, the answer might be that they were not in the wrong. However, I'm not entirely sure. Another perspective says that they had a right to request her removal if they felt she was a health risk, but the staff's initial lack of action might mean there wasn't a direct threat. So the answer could be A (they're in the wrong) because they acted on their own judgment without the staff's prior assessment. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the staff's actions validated their concern. Hmm.\n"
