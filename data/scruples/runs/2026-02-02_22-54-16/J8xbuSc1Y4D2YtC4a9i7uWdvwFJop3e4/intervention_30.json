Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person with a bad cough was served there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant is in a sketchy area but has great reviews. The couple went there, and when a homeless woman with a severe cough and bad hygiene entered, they demanded she be removed. The staff didn't act initially, so they left after she was escorted out. The author feels justified, but the question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nPossible points to consider: \n\n1. **Discrimination against homeless individuals**: The author's decision to leave might be seen as discriminatory, as they didn't want to be in the same space as someone homeless. That could be considered wrong because it perpetuates stigma and exclusion.\n\n2. **Health concerns**: The cough was described as sounding like TB, and the woman was dirty. There's a legitimate health and safety concern here. However, the restaurant is responsible for managing such situations, not the customers. The author might have overstepped by demanding removal, but their concern isn't entirely unfounded.\n\n3. **Restaurant's responsibility**: The staff didn't act immediately, which is a problem. They should address health and safety issues, including ensuring all patrons are clean and not a health risk. If they didn't handle it, maybe the author had a right to be concerned.\n\n4. **Alternative actions**: The author could have asked for a different seating area or requested a manager instead of confronting the staff. By demanding removal and leaving, they might have been abrupt.\n\n5. **Perception of the homeless person**: The description of the woman is very negative, which might indicate bias. The author's reaction could be based on prejudice rather than a genuine health threat. Even if the woman was a health risk, the author's response might not be the restaurant's fault.\n\n6. **Legal and ethical aspects**: In many places, homeless people have the right to access restaurants unless they pose a direct threat. The restaurant should handle such situations discreetly, not have customers demand removal.\n\nBalancing these points, the author's action might be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory. Even if they had health concerns, the way they handled it\u2014demanding the woman's removal and leaving\u2014could be viewed as in the wrong. The restaurant should have addressed the situation without customer intervention. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the restaurant failed in their duty, the author isn't entirely at fault. But overall, the act of leaving because of a homeless person's presence likely makes them the asshole.\n"
