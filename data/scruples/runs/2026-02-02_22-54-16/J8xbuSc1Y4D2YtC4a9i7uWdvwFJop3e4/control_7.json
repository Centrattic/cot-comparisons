Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant served a homeless woman who was visibly unwell and dirty, which made the author uncomfortable. The author and their dad confronted the staff, leading to her being escorted out, and then they left without eating the free roll.\n\nFrom a human rights perspective, homeless individuals have the same rights as anyone else to access public spaces, including restaurants. It's not illegal to serve them, and the restaurant might have a policy of serving all customers regardless of their background. The author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory, as they judged the woman based on her appearance and health status, which might be a symptom of underlying health issues or lack of access to resources.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about health and safety is understandable. If someone is coughing severely, it could be a legitimate health hazard, especially in a place where food is served. But instead of confronting the staff, the author could have taken other steps, like asking the restaurant to address the health concerns without publicly humiliating the woman. By demanding she be removed, the author might have contributed to her being turned away, which could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory.\n\nThe staff didn't initially address the situation, which might indicate that the restaurant has a policy of not discriminating. The author's immediate reaction to leave after she was removed might be justified if they felt there was a health risk, but it's also possible that their decision was based on prejudice rather than an actual threat.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, the author's approach might have been too confrontational. A more appropriate step might have been to politely request the staff to address the situation without escalating it. Leaving immediately after a confrontation could be seen as abandoning the restaurant, especially since they were given an apology and a free roll to make up for the inconvenience.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for discriminating against the homeless woman and for not handling the situation more sensitively. They should have found a way to address their concerns without violating the rights of others.\n"
