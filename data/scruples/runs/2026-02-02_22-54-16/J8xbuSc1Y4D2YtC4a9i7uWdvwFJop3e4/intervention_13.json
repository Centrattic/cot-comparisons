Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they went to a restaurant, and there was a homeless woman who came in. She was coughing a lot and looked very dirty. The author and their dad told the staff to remove her, and then they left after the woman was escorted out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They were in a restaurant, which is a public space. They paid for their food, had a good experience initially. Then this woman comes in, who is visibly unwell and homeless. The author felt uncomfortable because of the cough and the smell. They were worried about their health or just the overall experience. They asked the staff to remove her, and when that happened, they left without eating the free roll given to them.\n\nOn the other side, the woman seems to be in a vulnerable position. She might be homeless, which is a significant social issue. The restaurant allowed her to enter, which could be seen as providing a service to someone in need. The author's reaction might be based on prejudice against homeless people, associating their presence with dirtiness or disease, which can be a stereotype. Also, the author is implying that the woman's presence was a threat to their dining experience, which might be more about their own discomfort rather than an actual health risk.\n\nBut then, customers do have certain expectations when they pay for a meal. If they feel that the environment is affecting their experience, they might feel justified in leaving. However, the line is drawn when the action is based on discrimination against someone's socioeconomic status. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) aspect here is whether it's right to ask for someone to be removed from a public place just because of their appearance and condition.\n\nAlso, the restaurant's response is important. They apologized and removed the woman, which suggests that maybe the staff were also uncomfortable with her presence, or they wanted to retain customers. But if the woman was allowed in, maybe the restaurant has a policy of being inclusive. The author's decision to leave after the woman was removed could be seen as taking advantage of the situation to avoid their responsibility to be considerate.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, is it acceptable to demand that a homeless person be removed from a restaurant? Some might argue that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, even in a public space where money is exchanged. Others might say that customers have a right to a comfortable dining experience. The key here is whether the author's actions were based on genuine concern for health (which is hard to prove without medical evidence) or prejudice.\n\nThe author mentions the woman's cough sounded like she had TB. TB is contagious, but without medical confirmation, it's an assumption. The smell and dirt might be a result of homelessness, not a personal failing. The author's reaction could be a knee-jerk response to someone they perceive as \"dirty,\" which is a common stigma against homeless individuals.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were discriminatory. If they had asked the staff to ensure the woman's health and safety, that's different. But demanding her removal based on appearances is questionable. The fact that they left after she was escorted out suggests that their decision was influenced by her presence, which could be seen as the real issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's discomfort is understandable, their action of demanding the woman's removal and then leaving might be considered inconsiderate and discriminatory. Therefore, they might be the asshole in this situation.\n"
