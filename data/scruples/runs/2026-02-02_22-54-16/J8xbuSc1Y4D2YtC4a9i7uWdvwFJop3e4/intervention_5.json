Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, found a homeless woman who was coughing and smelled bad, and they told the staff to remove her or they'd leave. The staff did remove her, but they ended up leaving without eating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person mentions the woman was coughing violently, looked very dirty, and had a bad smell. They felt uncomfortable and decided to leave. The question is whether their reaction is justified.\n\nOn one hand, homeless people deserve respect and shouldn't be discriminated against. The restaurant should be a place open to everyone, regardless of their appearance. The staff didn't address the woman's condition, which might be a problem. The customers might be acting out of fear or discomfort, which is understandable, but does that make their actions wrong?\n\nOn the other hand, the customers were paying customers and had the right to ask for a safe environment. If someone is coughing in a way that could be contagious, restaurants have a duty to protect customers. However, the staff's response was only to give her water, not to address the health concern. Maybe the customers felt that the restaurant wasn't doing its job to protect them, leading them to leave.\n\nBut is it right to demand someone be removed just because of appearance and symptoms? The woman might have been there for a legitimate reason, like seeking help or just needing a place to sit. The customers' actions could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the cough was truly concerning, maybe the restaurant should have taken action, and the customers were just pushing for that.\n\nAnother angle is the restaurant's responsibility. If the place is in a sketchy area, maybe they're used to such situations. The staff not addressing the issue might mean they didn't see it as a problem, but the customers did. The customers might have felt their health was at risk, leading them to leave rather than risk illness.\n\nIn terms of ethics, balancing the rights of the homeless person against the comfort of paying customers is tricky. The customers' actions could be seen as inconsiderate, but if they felt unsafe or unwell, that's a valid concern. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if the restaurant failed to address the situation adequately. However, the way they directly told the staff to remove the woman could be seen as abrupt and possibly discriminatory. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the customers overstepped by demanding her removal, or if the restaurant should have handled it better. If the restaurant didn't act, the customers might have felt justified in pushing for a resolution. But if the customers made a judgment based on appearance without knowing the woman's situation, that's problematic. The decision to leave is a personal choice, but demanding someone be removed could be seen as wrong. However, given the restaurant's lack of action, maybe the customers were just advocating for their own comfort and safety. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the customers acted in self-defense against potential health risks and the restaurant didn't address the issue. But there's a valid argument for A because of discrimination. However, the key is the restaurant's inaction. If the staff didn't do anything, the customers might be justified in leaving. So B.\n"
