Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a new restaurant, which was in a sketchy area but had great reviews. They were at the sushi bar, and a homeless woman came in, sat next to their dad, had a terrible cough, was very dirty, and the smell was overwhelming. The author and their dad demanded the restaurant to remove her, and they left even after getting a free roll. Now, they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different perspectives. On one hand, the author and their father were disturbed by the woman's appearance and health, leading to discomfort and a loss of appetite. They felt the restaurant should have handled it, maybe by offering a private area or some alternative. The restaurant did apologize and give a free roll, but they still left. But on the other hand, the woman was a customer, and the restaurant might have a policy of serving all people regardless of their situation. The act of demanding her to leave could be seen as discriminatory or insensitive, especially if the woman was unable to maintain hygiene due to homelessness and the restaurant's policy is to assist rather than exclude.\n\nI should check for any ethical or social norms here. In many places, there's an emphasis on inclusivity and not discriminating against homeless individuals. Restaurants might face criticism if they eject someone based on appearance, but they also have a responsibility to their other customers. However, the author's approach was to confront the restaurant and leave when they didn't remove the woman immediately. That might be seen as abrupt. But the restaurant didn't initially offer an alternative, just brought her water. The key is whether the author had the right to demand her removal, which could be a policy issue. Also, the health concern (cough resembling TB) is a red flag, but that's subjective. The smell and appearance might affect other diners, so the restaurant's response is important here.\n\nIf the restaurant didn't provide an option for the author to move to another area, the author might feel justified in leaving. But if the restaurant had the right to serve all customers, then demanding her removal could be problematic. The answer hinges on whether the restaurant's policy allows for such situations and how they handled it. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, but the restaurant's lack of action could also be at fault. However, the user is saying the author isn't in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that the restaurant should accommodate all patrons, but the author might have overstepped by demanding someone leave. Alternatively, if the restaurant's response was inadequate, the author's reaction is understandable. I need to weigh the options. Typically, in such scenarios, the assumption is that the restaurant should try to accommodate everyone, so demanding the removal of a customer might be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A, but the user thinks B. Let me think again. The woman was served without issue, and the restaurant didn't ask her to leave. The author's request to remove her might be seen as discriminatory. The smell and appearance, while unpleasant, might not be a valid reason to ask someone to leave unless there's a health code violation. Since the woman wasn't breaking any rules, the author's demand could be impolite. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
