Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who left the restaurant because a homeless person with a bad cough was being served is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author and their dad went to a restaurant, which was crowded. They were at the sushi bar, enjoying their meal. Then a homeless woman entered, appeared very dirty, and had a severe cough. The staff didn't intervene, and when the authors demanded she be removed, the staff complied. The authors left because of the smell and discomfort.\n\nFrom the author's point of view, they were concerned about health risks, especially given the cough and smell. They wanted to protect themselves from potential illness. But is it their place to demand someone else be removed from a public space? That's a key point. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant has a responsibility to serve all customers regardless of their circumstances, as long as they aren't breaking rules. The woman was there, and the staff didn't ask her to leave until the authors intervened. However, the authors might have felt that the woman was a health hazard. But is that a valid reason? \n\nHomelessness is a social issue, and while the woman's appearance and health might be concerning, the authors could have handled it differently. Maybe they could have asked the staff to check on her or call someone for assistance instead of demanding her removal. Public health regulations usually require establishments to maintain cleanliness, but individual customers don't have the authority to eject others. \n\nAlso, the act of leaving after the situation was resolved might be justified, but the initial demand could be seen as inconsiderate. The authors' actions might have made the staff uncomfortable and disrupted the service for others. However, they were within their rights to leave if they felt the environment was unsanitary. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the authors might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their own health, but they could have approached the situation more compassionately. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether their actions were the best possible. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards B (no), but there's nuance. The authors acted on their discomfort and health concerns, which is understandable, but perhaps they could have handled it differently. Still, the direct question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since they didn't break any laws and had a right to leave, the answer is B.\n"
