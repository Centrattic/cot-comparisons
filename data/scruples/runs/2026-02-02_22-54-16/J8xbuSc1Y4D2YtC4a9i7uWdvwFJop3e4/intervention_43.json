Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, and a homeless woman walked in, looked very dirty, coughed a lot, and they ended up leaving. The main question is if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant is in a sketchy area, but the reviews were good. The author went with their dad, everything was great until the woman came in. The woman's appearance and cough were disturbing. The author and dad told the restaurant to remove her, and they did, but they left anyway after being given a free roll.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethical angle. On one hand, the woman was a customer, and the restaurant served her. The author and their dad felt uncomfortable because of her appearance, cough, and smell. Their reaction was probably based on fear of illness or discomfort. But is it right to demand someone be removed just because they look homeless and are sick?\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant didn't say anything to her initially. They only acted when the author and dad asked. The woman was a customer, and even if she was homeless, the restaurant should treat all patrons equally. The act of demanding her removal could be seen as discriminatory. However, in the context of public health, if someone is coughing a lot and looks very ill, maybe there's a concern about spreading disease. But TB is contagious through the air, not just by proximity, so maybe their fear was overblown.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions versus the rights of others. The restaurant served her, which was their responsibility. The author's decision to leave might be their right, but the act of demanding her removal could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the restaurant did remove her when asked, so maybe they handled it appropriately. The author left because they were upset, which is their choice, but the initial confrontation might be seen as inconsiderate towards the homeless woman.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for making a scene and demanding the woman's removal based on her appearance and health. However, their discomfort is understandable. The restaurant's response (apologizing and giving a free roll) suggests they acknowledged some fault. The author's actions, while possibly overreacting, might be considered a personal choice rather than entirely in the wrong. But the act of demanding someone be removed because they're homeless and ill could be seen as discriminatory, which would make the author at fault. \n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The answer might depend on cultural norms and societal attitudes towards homelessness. In some places, people might be more sympathetic, seeing the author's actions as discriminatory. In others, the fear of illness might be more understood. I think the consensus here would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they prioritized their own comfort over the rights of another person, even if the situation was uncomfortable. So the answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
