Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The person went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they were at the bar. The food and service were good until a homeless woman entered. She was very dirty, had a terrible cough, and the smell was overwhelming. The author and their dad demanded she be removed, which she was, and then they left without eating the free roll offered.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. First, consider the restaurant's responsibility. If they allow a homeless person to be served, that's their choice. The author's reaction is based on the woman's appearance and health symptoms. But is it right to demand someone be removed just for looking homeless and coughing? Health and safety could be a concern if the person was visibly ill and contagious, but TB coughs can be severe, but appearance isn't a diagnosis. However, the restaurant didn't ask her to leave, so the author took it upon themselves to request her removal. That might be seen as being judgmental or discriminatory against the homeless. On the other hand, if the environment is unpleasant, maybe the restaurant should have addressed it. But the patrons aren't obligated to tolerate it, though demanding removal might be considered rude. Alternatively, the author could have left quietly instead of confronting the staff. The free roll and apology might not have been sufficient. There's a balance between respecting others and personal discomfort. Depending on cultural or social norms, some might say the author overstepped by demanding the woman's ejection, while others might understand the health concern. But generally, public spaces should be accessible to all, so the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate towards the homeless and the restaurant's policies. So maybe the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
