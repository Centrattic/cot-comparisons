Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant after they saw a homeless person being served there. The scenario involves the writer and their dad being at a sushi restaurant that ends up serving a visibly dirty and coughing homeless woman. The restaurant staff didn't intervene, so the writer and dad demanded her removal. The staff then escorted her out, and the writer left without eating the free roll offered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The homeless woman is being served food, which is a basic human need. The writer and their dad decided to leave because of her appearance and coughing, which might be seen as a health concern. But is that a valid reason to ask for her removal? Also, the staff didn't initially offer help, but when the customers demanded it, they complied. \n\nThe writer's actions seem to prioritize their own comfort and potential health over someone in obvious need. However, there's the argument that public health is important, especially in a restaurant setting. But the woman's condition could be due to various factors, not just homelessness. The writer's reaction might be influenced by stigma or fear, which is a common issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant might have a responsibility to ensure all patrons feel comfortable, but they might also be legally obligated to serve all individuals, regardless of appearance or health status, unless there's a direct threat. The writer's demand to remove the woman could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the woman wasn't actually a health hazard. \n\nThe key points here are empathy, public health, and discrimination. The writer's actions might be justified if there was a real health risk, but the story doesn't confirm that the woman was contagious or a threat. The reaction seems more based on appearance and fear, which could be considered inconsiderate. The fact that the staff then complied with their request, removing the woman, might indicate that the restaurant prioritized the customers' comfort over serving someone in need. \n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether their actions were reasonable. Since the woman was being served and there's no evidence of immediate danger, the writer's demand to remove her could be seen as discriminatory or judgmental. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, there's also the aspect of public health concerns, which complicates it. But without proof of a health risk, it's more about the writer's comfort, not the woman's safety. So the answer is A.\n"
