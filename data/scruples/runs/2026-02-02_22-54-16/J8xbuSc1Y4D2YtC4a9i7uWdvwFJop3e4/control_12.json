Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is they went to a restaurant with their dad, and a homeless woman was served there. The woman was coughing a lot, looked really dirty, and had a bad smell. The person and their dad asked the restaurant to remove her, and when they did, they left without eating the free roll. Now they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the restaurant is a public place, and everyone should have access to services regardless of their situation. The woman being homeless doesn't mean she shouldn't be served. The restaurant didn't do anything wrong by letting her in. So, if the author and their dad demanded her removal because they were uncomfortable, that could be seen as discriminatory. They made a judgment based on her appearance and health, which might be prejudiced.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's cough and smell might have made the dining experience unpleasant. If the author felt physically ill or was afraid of illness, maybe they had a reason. But the restaurant should have handled it without removing her. Maybe they could have provided masks or addressed the smell without ejecting her. Also, the fact that the staff didn't intervene until the author asked suggests they might have been inconsiderate of her needs. \n\nBut the key issue is whether the author had the right to demand she be removed. The restaurant is responsible for maintaining a safe and clean environment. If the woman was a health hazard, the restaurant should take action, but the author's immediate reaction was to leave, which might be overreacting. Also, their judgment based on her appearance (homeless, dirty, coughing) could be seen as insensitive. \n\nIn many places, businesses can't discriminate against people based on their socioeconomic status. By demanding her removal, the author might be contributing to that discrimination. Even if the woman was unwell, it's not the customer's place to demand she be removed. The restaurant should handle any health concerns. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory. They might be the asshole for prioritizing their own comfort over the rights of a homeless person. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if the woman was a real health risk, but the author's perception of that risk is unfounded. Without evidence of a real threat, their reaction is still problematic. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
