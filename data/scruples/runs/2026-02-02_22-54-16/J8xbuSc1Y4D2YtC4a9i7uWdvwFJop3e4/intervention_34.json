Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation is described where the person and their dad went to a new sushi place in a sketchy area. They were at the bar, and a homeless woman with a bad cough and strong odor sat next to them. After not getting attention from staff, they told the restaurant to remove her or they'd leave. The staff complied, but they still left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The person is saying they left because the homeless woman was sick and smelled bad. But is it wrong to ask for her to be removed? Restaurants are public places and should serve everyone, regardless of their appearance or circumstances. However, there's a balance between inclusion and safety. If someone is visibly ill and poses a health risk, the restaurant should address that. But the staff didn't act, only bringing water. The patrons took matters into their own hands by demanding her removal. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the woman's health condition, the patrons' reaction, and the restaurant's responsibility. The patrons might have felt uncomfortable, but their response could be seen as discriminatory. Homeless individuals often face stigma, and the focus on her appearance and cough might be a bias. Also, the restaurant's duty to serve all customers unless there's a direct threat to health and safety. The patrons' immediate demand to remove her could be seen as overriding the restaurant's responsibility to accommodate or assist her, rather than the customers taking action.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the restaurant didn't enforce their own rules (like a dress code or health policies) and only served her water might indicate they didn't see her as a threat. The patrons' decision to leave might be understandable due to personal discomfort, but the way they handled it\u2014demanding her removal\u2014could be problematic. They might be in the wrong for not considering the restaurant's role in handling the situation and for making a judgment based on her appearance and cough, which could be due to various reasons beyond her control. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they took it upon themselves to exclude someone from a public space without evidence of a health risk, which could be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant should handle such situations, not individual customers. Even if the woman was unwell, the patrons' reaction was harsh and possibly based on prejudice.\n"
