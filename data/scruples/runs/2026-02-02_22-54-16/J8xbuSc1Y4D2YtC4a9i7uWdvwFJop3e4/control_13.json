Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant when they saw a homeless person being served there. The situation involves a person who entered the restaurant, was coughing a lot, and appeared very dirty. The author and their dad demanded the staff to remove her, which they did, and then the family left without eating the free roll offered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the restaurant is a public place and should serve everyone regardless of their circumstances. The homeless person had the right to be there just like anyone else. The staff didn't make her leave initially, so maybe they were following their policy of treating all customers equally. The author and their dad acted based on their own discomfort, which might be seen as discriminatory.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt genuinely uncomfortable due to the health concerns from the coughing and the smell. They might have been worried about hygiene and illness. However, demanding someone be removed because of their appearance or health status can be problematic. The staff did provide her with a glass of water, which shows they were trying to serve her politely. The author's reaction could be seen as rude or prejudiced, especially if the staff didn't have a policy against such situations.\n\nAlso, the fact that they left immediately after the woman was removed might indicate that their main issue was with her presence rather than the service or food quality. The sushi chef offered a free roll as an apology, which the author didn't accept. This could imply that the staff was trying to be accommodating, but the author's response was still to leave, which might be seen as unnecessary.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal health concerns. If the coughing was severe and persistent, maybe the author was justified in feeling concerned about contagious diseases. But in a public setting, unless there's a visible threat like blood or something, it's more about perception. The author's reaction might be based on fear or bias rather than actual health risks.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, restaurants should serve all people regardless of their status. The author's behavior might be considered inconsiderate towards the homeless person. However, the situation is nuanced because they did confront the staff before leaving, which could be seen as a way to address the issue rather than just leaving without a word.\n\nI need to balance empathy for the author's discomfort with the rights of the homeless person. The key points are the demand to remove the woman, the immediate leaving after she was escorted out, and the overall judgment of the situation. The author's actions might be seen as discriminatory, making them the asshole here. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe there's a middle ground. If the restaurant didn't have policies against serving homeless people, then the author's demand was inappropriate. However, if the author's health was genuinely at risk, but that's not clear. The main issue seems to be their reaction based on appearance and coughing without knowing the actual reason.\n"
