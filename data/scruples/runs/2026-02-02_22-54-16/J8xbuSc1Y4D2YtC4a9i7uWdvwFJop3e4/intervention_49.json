Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, which was serving a homeless woman who was coughing and dirty. The couple told the staff they'd leave unless the woman was removed. The staff did remove her, but the couple left anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the couple felt uncomfortable and unwell due to the woman's appearance and cough. They might have been concerned about health or safety. On the other hand, the restaurant was serving a customer, and the couple's demand to remove her could be seen as discriminatory or insensitive.\n\nThe key points here are public health and personal responsibility. If the woman posed a direct health risk, like having an infectious disease, the restaurant should have taken measures. But the couple didn't know for sure she was sick; they just assumed based on her cough. The restaurant didn't act initially, which might suggest they didn't see her as a risk. When the couple intervened, the staff did remove her, but the couple left without eating the free food, which could be seen as holding a grudge or being rude.\n\nAlso, the act of demanding someone to be removed from a public place can be discriminatory. Everyone has the right to access public services regardless of their appearance or perceived health. The couple's reaction might be more about their own discomfort rather than a real threat. They might be in the wrong for not considering the woman's rights and the restaurant's role in serving all customers.\n\nHowever, the couple's discomfort is real. They had a legitimate reason to feel uneasy, but their solution was to pressure the restaurant to remove a customer, which isn't their place. So, while their feelings are understandable, their actions could be seen as wrong because they didn't allow the restaurant to handle the situation, and they left abruptly, which could be seen as rude or judgmental.\n"
