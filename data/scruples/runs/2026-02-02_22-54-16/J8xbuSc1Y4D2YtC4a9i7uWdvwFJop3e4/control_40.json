Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they were in a restaurant and a homeless person came in, and they made the staff remove her because she was coughing and looked dirty. The author and their dad then left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant was busy, and they were at the sushi bar. The homeless woman was coughing, which the author found alarming, and she was visibly unclean. The staff didn't seem to do much except give her water. The author and their dad demanded she be removed, which the staff did. Then they left, not eating the free roll they were given.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, restaurants are public places and should be accessible to everyone. Homeless individuals have the right to enter public spaces unless they're violating specific rules. However, if someone is causing a disturbance or poses a health risk, the staff can ask them to leave. But was the woman causing a disturbance? The author says they made the staff remove her. The staff didn't act initially, but complied. The issue is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nThe woman was coughing, which might be a health concern, but unless she was confirmed to have a contagious disease, it's hard to justify. Also, the appearance being \"dirty\" is subjective, but in a restaurant, hygiene is a concern. However, the author and their dad made the decision to demand her removal based on their perception. That could be seen as discriminatory or rude, as the woman was just sitting there and not directly interacting with them. \n\nOn the other hand, if the restaurant allowed her to stay, but the staff didn't intervene, maybe the staff's inaction is part of the problem. The author might feel justified in speaking up for their health and safety. But is it right to ask the staff to remove a customer based on their appearance and symptoms without confirmation? That could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author left after the woman was removed. The sushi chef apologized and offered compensation, but they still left. That might make it seem like they were being difficult. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the act of demanding a homeless person to be removed because of appearance and symptoms could be considered discriminatory. The staff's role is to handle such situations, and patrons shouldn't dictate who is allowed to enter unless there's a clear violation of rules. So the author might be in the wrong for not letting the staff handle it and for making a scene. \n\nAlso, the woman was a customer, and the author's actions could be seen as bullying. The smell and coughing are not the woman's fault, but the author chose to act on them. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
