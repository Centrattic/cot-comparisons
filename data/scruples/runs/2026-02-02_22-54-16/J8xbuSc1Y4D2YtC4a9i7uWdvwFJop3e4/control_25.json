Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation is that the author and their dad went to a new restaurant, which they really wanted to try. They found it packed and sat at the bar. The experience was good until a homeless-looking woman with a bad cough came in and sat next to them. The staff didn't do anything except give her water. The author and dad demanded she be removed, which she was, and they left without eating their free roll.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, the key points: the woman is homeless, appears very dirty and is coughing. The author and dad felt uncomfortable, demanded her removal, and left. The staff didn't act until they intervened. \n\nOn one hand, the restaurant should serve all customers regardless of their appearance or circumstances. Homelessness is a social issue, and the staff might have a policy to accommodate everyone. The author's actions could be seen as discriminatory, targeting the woman based on her appearance and health. It's important to consider empathy and the ethical responsibility to not contribute to marginalizing vulnerable groups.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's health concerns might be a factor. If the coughing was severe, maybe they were worried about health risks. However, the response of demanding immediate removal and leaving could be seen as inconsiderate. The staff already gave her water but didn't act, which might suggest they had their own policies. The author's reaction might be impulsive and not considering the staff's role or the woman's situation.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions the woman's appearance as extremely dirty and the smell being overwhelming. That could affect other diners' comfort. However, the restaurant's responsibility is to provide a service to all while maintaining hygiene standards. It's possible the staff didn't act because they have protocols for handling such situations, and the author's intervention might have been unnecessary. Alternatively, maybe the staff was avoiding conflict and the author felt compelled to act to protect themselves and their dad.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might be seen as a breach of hospitality. Restaurants are public spaces, and while it's uncomfortable, it's part of the experience. However, the presence of someone who's visibly ill and unclean could pose a health risk, though that's a big assumption. The author's reaction may be justified if they felt a direct threat, but the way they handled it\u2014demanding removal and leaving\u2014might be harsh.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"assholes\" here is about whether they acted inconsiderately. The author's justification is based on their personal comfort and health, which is subjective. The woman's right to be served versus the author's right to a pleasant dining experience. It's a conflict between different human rights.\n\nIn many places, businesses can't discriminate against people based on appearance or homelessness unless there's a specific health code violation. The woman might not have been violating any codes, so the staff can't remove her without cause. The author's demand for removal could be seen as overstepping, assuming the staff was not in violation.\n\nAdditionally, the social responsibility aspect: treating all people with dignity, regardless of their circumstances. The author's actions might contribute to stigmatizing the homeless population. The author could have handled it more sensitively, perhaps asking to be seated elsewhere, but instead reacted strongly.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to be careful. There's a balance between personal health concerns and social responsibility. If the woman was actually a health risk, but the author assumed that, then it's different. However, without evidence of a health code violation, the staff can't remove her, so the author's intervention is taking matters into their own hands. Thus, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the restaurant's policies and the woman's right to be served.\n"
