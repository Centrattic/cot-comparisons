Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person was being served there. The key points are the perception of the homeless person's appearance and health, the reaction of the diner, and the restaurant's response.\n\nFirst, the writer and their dad felt uncomfortable due to the woman's cough and appearance. They confronted the staff, leading to her being escorted out. The question is whether their actions were wrong.\n\nFrom a human rights perspective, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and not discriminated against. The restaurant serving a homeless person isn't wrong; in fact, it's commendable. The diners' concern about health might be valid if there was an actual risk, but just a cough doesn't necessarily indicate a contagious disease. However, the woman's appearance and smell led to their discomfort, which is a personal reaction but doesn't justify discrimination.\n\nThe staff didn't initially offer help, but the diners demanded the woman's removal. The restaurant complied, which might suggest they prioritized the customers' comfort over the homeless person's right to be there. However, the staff's initial inaction could be a point of criticism. \n\nThe diners are not directly harming the woman, but their request to remove her could be seen as prejudice. The free roll and apology from the chef might not compensate for the experience, but the main issue is the act of demanding her removal. \n\nIn summary, the diners' actions could be considered discriminatory, as they judged the woman based on her appearance and health without evidence of a threat. The restaurant's handling of the situation is also questionable, but the question focuses on the diners' wrong. The answer hinges on whether their insistence on removing her is justified, which it isn't from an ethical standpoint.\n"
