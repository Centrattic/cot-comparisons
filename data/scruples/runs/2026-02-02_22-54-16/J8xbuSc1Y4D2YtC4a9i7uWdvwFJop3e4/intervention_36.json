Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were serving a homeless woman. The situation is presented as \"Am I the asshole?\" and the user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant was in a sketchy area but had good reviews. The woman was visibly unwell, dirty, and smelly. The diners felt uncomfortable and demanded she be removed. The restaurant complied, but they still left.\n\nThe question is about whether their reaction was justified. On one hand, the woman was a customer, and the restaurant should treat all patrons equally. The author's actions might be seen as discriminatory towards homeless individuals. On the other hand, the woman's appearance and coughing could have been a health concern, which is a valid public health issue. \n\nBut in many places, refusing service to someone based on their appearance or homelessness is against the law. However, restaurants can ask someone to leave if they're a health risk. The woman was already there, and the staff didn't act until the diners intervened. \n\nThe author's immediate reaction was to demand her removal. That could be seen as inconsiderate, but they were also within their rights to ask for her removal if they felt there was a health risk. The fact that the restaurant eventually removed her might support the idea that there was a legitimate concern. However, the author's decision to leave after the woman was removed might be seen as unnecessary, but understandable given the situation.\n\nThere's a balance between public health and discrimination. If the woman was indeed a health hazard, the restaurant should have acted earlier. But since they didn't, the diners might have felt compelled to speak up. However, their approach could be seen as rude or judgmental. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they might not be in the wrong because they were concerned about health and safety. But they could also be considered in the wrong for not being more patient or considering the restaurant's policies. The answer likely depends on whether the woman's condition was a genuine health risk or just a personal discomfort. The story states the cough sounded like TB and the smell was overwhelming, which could justify their concern. However, assuming she was homeless and unclean might also contribute to a biased reaction.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's a nuanced argument here. If the restaurant failed to address the issue, the diners' intervention could be justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue A (in the wrong) if they believe it's discriminatory to ask a homeless person to leave. However, the specific health concerns might tip the balance. I think the answer is B.\n"
