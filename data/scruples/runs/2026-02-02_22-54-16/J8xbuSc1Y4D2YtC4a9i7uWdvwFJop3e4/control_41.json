Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant and when a homeless woman with a bad cough came in, they demanded she be removed, then left when she was. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are that the woman was homeless, visibly unclean, coughing, and the restaurant staff didn't remove her. The couple felt uncomfortable, asked for her removal, and left when she was escorted out. \n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. On one hand, the couple might feel that their health and comfort were compromised. The cough could be a legitimate health concern, and the smell and appearance made them lose their appetite. But on the other hand, the restaurant is a public place, and everyone has the right to be served, including homeless individuals. The couple's reaction might be seen as judgmental or discriminatory, especially if they didn't consider other options like moving seats or addressing their concerns privately. \n\nAlso, the restaurant's role is important. If they didn't address the situation first, maybe the couple should have communicated their concerns to the staff instead of demanding her removal. The fact that the staff eventually asked her to leave might indicate they had a policy, but the couple's immediate reaction could be seen as rude or inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the couple did express concern about the health risk. If the cough was severe, maybe they had a point, but without knowing the actual health status, it's possible they were overreacting. The story doesn't mention if the woman was a threat, just that her appearance and cough were alarming. \n\nIn terms of social responsibility, expecting that homeless people should be treated with dignity and not denied service unless there's a clear violation of rules. The couple's actions might be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over someone else's right to be in the restaurant. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong (A) because they didn't handle it with more tact, possibly overreacted, and didn't consider the homeless person's rights. But there's a counterargument that they had a right to feel uncomfortable and ask for her removal if they felt a health risk. But without knowing the actual health status, it's a judgment call. The answer may depend on cultural norms and how public businesses handle such situations. In many places, discrimination against homeless people is a sensitive issue, so the couple's actions might be considered wrong.\n"
