Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they went to a new restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they were at the sushi bar. The food and service were good until a homeless woman came in, sat next to them, and started coughing a lot. The author describes her as extremely dirty and the cough as sounding like TB. They told the staff to remove her, and when they did, the author left without eating the free roll they were given.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author felt uncomfortable because of the woman's appearance and coughing. They asked staff to remove her, which was done. Then they left, even though they were offered a free item. The question is whether they are at fault for leaving because of this.\n\nOn one hand, the restaurant's responsibility is to serve all customers, including those in need. The staff did bring her water and didn't immediately eject her, which might be standard policy. But the author's reaction was based on health concerns due to the cough and smell. However, the staff did remove her after the request. \n\nBut is it right to ask someone to leave based on appearances? Homeless people often face discrimination. The author's actions could be seen as discriminatory, pushing for someone to be removed just because of their appearance and perceived health risks. However, the staff did comply, so maybe the author felt justified in leaving because of their discomfort, not necessarily because of something the restaurant did wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the restaurant might have protocols for handling such situations. If the woman was a regular customer or if the restaurant has a policy of serving all people regardless of circumstances, then the author's request might have been within their right. But demanding someone to leave could be seen as rude, especially if the staff had already addressed the situation by removing her. The author left immediately after, which could be seen as overreacting, but maybe they felt it was necessary for their own well-being and safety.\n\nAlso, the health aspect: if the cough was concerning, perhaps the staff should have addressed it. But the staff didn't initially remove her, so maybe the author felt they had to act. However, there's a line between health concerns and discrimination. The smell and cough might have been a legitimate health concern, but the way they handled it could be problematic.\n\nIn the end, the author's actions led to the woman being removed. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether their request was justified. If the restaurant's staff didn't provide a clean environment or handle the situation properly, maybe the author isn't at fault. But if their actions were based on prejudice against homeless individuals, then they might be. However, the staff did remove the woman, so the restaurant wasn't necessarily in the wrong either.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they felt their health was at risk, but there's a nuance. However, given the options, maybe the answer leans towards B. Wait, but some might argue that it's wrong to request someone to leave just because they're homeless. But the staff did remove her, so the author's action led to that. But the author left because of discomfort, which could be seen as their own choice, not the restaurant's fault. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
