Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person went to a new restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they sat at the sushi bar. The food was great, and the chef was friendly. Then a homeless-looking woman came in, sat next to them, had a terrible cough, looked very dirty, and the smell was bad. The restaurant didn't do anything about her, so the person and their dad told the staff they'd leave if she wasn't removed. The staff apologized, escorted her out, gave a free roll, but they left anyway without eating it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The woman was homeless, visibly unwell, and the staff didn't initially react. The customers demanded her removal. The staff then complied. The customers left, feeling uncomfortable. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. On one hand, the restaurant should provide service to all, including homeless individuals. It's their right to be served unless causing a disturbance. The customers might be seen as discriminatory, making the staff remove her because of her appearance and health. That could be seen as unfair or prejudiced. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman's appearance and cough might have made the customers feel physically unwell or unsafe, leading to discomfort. However, their reaction was to demand her removal, which could be considered rude or inconsiderate. \n\nBut the restaurant is a public space, and customers shouldn't dictate who gets to be there. The staff's responsibility is to handle such situations, maybe by offering a separate area or ensuring hygiene. The customers might have overstepped by pressuring the staff to remove her, especially if she wasn't actually a threat. \n\nThe staff did apologize and tried to appease, but the customers still left. That shows they might have felt their request wasn't adequately addressed. However, the act of leaving after being given a free item might not be the issue, but the initial demand could be problematic. \n\nPossible angles: discrimination against homeless, overreacting to someone's appearance, vs. right to a comfortable dining experience. \n\nIn many cases, people argue that while it's uncomfortable, it's not the customer's place to demand removal of another patron unless there's a clear threat. Since the woman wasn't causing a disturbance beyond her appearance, the customers might be in the wrong. \n\nSo, answer A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they demanded the staff remove a customer based on appearance and health, which could be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant should handle such situations, not customers dictating who is served.\n"
