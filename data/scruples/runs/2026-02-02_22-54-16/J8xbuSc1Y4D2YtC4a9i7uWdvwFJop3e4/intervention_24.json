Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author went to a new restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, they were at the bar, food was good. Then a homeless woman enters, sits nearby, looks very dirty, coughs a lot, and the author and dad confront the staff to remove her. The staff complies, and they leave without eating the free roll offered.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate based on the details. The key points here are the actions of the author and the context. \n\nHomelessness is a complex issue. Restaurants serving homeless individuals isn't inherently bad; it's about choice and policy. The author's concern is about safety and comfort. The woman's appearance and cough might raise health concerns. The author and dad didn't immediately leave but asked the staff to remove her, which the staff did. Then they left, possibly due to the smell and loss of appetite.\n\nIs it wrong to ask for someone to be removed because of appearance and hygiene? It's tricky. On one hand, everyone deserves dignity and service. On the other, in a private business, the owner can set policies. If the restaurant allows homeless people, they might be doing so intentionally. But if someone is visibly ill and causing discomfort, there's a health and safety angle. However, making assumptions about someone's illness based on coughing isn't fair. Also, the author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory or classist. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the restaurant didn't have a policy against serving homeless people, the staff's inaction could be seen as okay. The author's confrontation might be justified if they felt their health was at risk. However, the author might be overreacting, mistaking the woman's condition. Yet, the staff did remove her, so perhaps their request was reasonable.\n\nThe author left, which might be seen as a last resort, but maybe they felt it was the only way to avoid discomfort. The answer depends on cultural context and values. In some places, it's seen as wrong to discriminate against homeless individuals. In others, personal comfort and safety take precedence. \n\nConsidering the AITA framework, the author's actions are a mix of justified concern and potential judgment. The staff did act after the request, so the restaurant isn't entirely at fault. The author's decision to leave might be seen as their right as a customer. However, the initial confrontation might be seen as impolite. But since the staff complied, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. While there's judgment involved, the actions were a response to a perceived threat, and the restaurant's handling was appropriate.\n"
