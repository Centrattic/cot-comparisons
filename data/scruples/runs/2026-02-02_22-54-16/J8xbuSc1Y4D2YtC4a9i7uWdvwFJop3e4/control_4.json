Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to a restaurant, and there was a homeless woman with a bad cough and in poor condition. The restaurant didn't remove her, so the author and their dad demanded she be removed, and after she was, they left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their actions. They asked the restaurant to remove the woman because they felt uncomfortable. The woman was coughing heavily and looked very unwell, which made the author and dad lose their appetite. The restaurant didn't remove her initially, so they threatened to leave unless she was removed. After she was escorted out, they left despite getting a free roll.\n\nNow, the question is whether they are at fault. On one hand, the author had a right to feel uncomfortable, especially if someone was coughing a lot, which could be a health concern. However, homeless people are entitled to go to public places, including restaurants. Restaurants aren't required to provide service to everyone, but once they allow someone in, they can't discriminate against them based on appearance or homelessness. The author is asking the restaurant to remove someone because of their appearance and health, which could be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant did offer her a glass of water, so they were providing service. The author's reaction might be seen as rude and excluding someone in need. Also, leaving because of someone else's presence might be considered inhospitable or contributing to a hostile environment towards vulnerable people. On the other hand, if the cough was a legitimate health hazard, maybe there's a public health concern, but the author didn't report it to health authorities, just demanded removal. So, perhaps the author's actions were more about their discomfort than a valid health issue. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for treating the homeless woman that way.\n"
