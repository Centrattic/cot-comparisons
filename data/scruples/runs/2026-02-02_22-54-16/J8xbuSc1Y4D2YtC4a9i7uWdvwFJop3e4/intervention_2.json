Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation is described where the author and their dad went to a new sushi place. The place was packed, and they sat at the bar. Then a homeless woman with a bad cough and a strong smell sat next to them. The staff didn't intervene until they asked to have her removed. After she was escorted out, the author felt nauseous and left without eating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is a customer who felt uncomfortable due to the presence of someone who is visibly unwell and homeless. The question is whether their reaction is justified. On one hand, the restaurant is a public place and should serve all customers regardless of their status. The staff didn't remove her initially, so maybe the author felt their health was at risk. On the other hand, the homeless woman is also a customer and should be treated with dignity. The act of pressuring the restaurant to remove her might be seen as discriminatory.\n\nThe author's actions could be viewed as inconsiderate because they didn't wait for the staff to handle the situation. However, they were concerned about their health and well-being. The smell and cough might pose a health risk, which is a valid concern. But is it the author's place to demand her removal, or should they have handled it differently, like asking for a seat change or alerting the staff to the health concerns?\n\nI should also consider the restaurant's responsibility. They might have a duty to ensure all customers are comfortable and safe. If the homeless woman was a regular or part of the community, the restaurant might have policies in place, but in this case, the staff didn't act until prompted. The author's insistence might be seen as necessary to protect their own health, but it could also be seen as insensitive to the homeless person's situation.\n\nThere's a balance between personal health concerns and social responsibility. If the author's actions led to the homeless person being denied service, that's a problem. However, if the restaurant was negligent in addressing the health and safety of all customers, the author's intervention could be justified. The key is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Insisting on leaving after the staff didn't act might be reasonable if they felt their health was at risk. However, the way they handled it\u2014demanding removal rather than seeking an alternative\u2014might be where the issue lies.\n\nIn terms of the \"AITA\" question, the community often looks at whether the action was discriminatory or inconsiderate. If the author had a genuine health concern, they might not be at fault. But if they simply didn't want to be near someone homeless, that's different. The description of the woman as \"dirty\" and the reaction of losing appetite might suggest a bias. The free roll and apology from the chef could indicate the restaurant felt they had to accommodate the author's request, possibly showing that the author's action was not entirely unjustified, but maybe the approach was harsh.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong if they genuinely felt a health risk and the staff didn't act. But there's a question of whether they could have handled it more sensitively. However, the core issue is whether their action of leaving was wrong. Since they left after the situation was resolved, it's more about their initial demand to have her removed. The answer might depend on the balance between personal health and social responsibility.\n"
