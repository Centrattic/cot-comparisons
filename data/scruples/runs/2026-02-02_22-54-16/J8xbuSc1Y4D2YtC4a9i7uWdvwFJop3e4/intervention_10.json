Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person who was coughing and looked very dirty. \n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The writer went to a restaurant, had a good experience, but then a homeless woman entered. She was coughing violently and looked very unclean. The writers, along with their dad, demanded that the staff remove her, and when they did, they left, not eating the free roll offered.\n\nFrom the writer's point of view, they might feel that their health and comfort were at risk due to the woman's apparent illness and hygiene. They might also be concerned about the restaurant's policy allowing such a situation, which could affect other customers. However, others might argue that the woman's presence in a public space is her right, and that the restaurant shouldn't discriminate against her, especially if she's a customer. \n\nI need to consider if the restaurant was wrong to serve her. In many places, businesses cannot discriminate against customers based on their appearance or homelessness, unless there's a valid health and safety concern. If the woman posed a direct threat to others' health (like a contagious disease), the restaurant might have a case. But the story mentions a cough that sounds like TB, but doesn't say she was actually sick. Assuming TB is contagious, but without confirmation, the restaurant might have overstepped. \n\nThe writers' actions involved confronting the staff and leaving. Was that appropriate? If the restaurant was not violating any laws by serving her, then the writers are essentially pressuring the establishment to remove a customer, which could be seen as inconsiderate and discriminatory. On the other hand, if the writers felt genuinely unsafe, their decision to leave might be more about their own comfort than the woman's rights.\n\nAlso, the restaurant did apologize and give a free item, but the writers still left. That could be seen as holding a grudge or being overly sensitive. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, there's a balance between personal comfort and social responsibility. The writers might be justified in leaving due to their discomfort, but demanding the woman's removal could be seen as contributing to stigmatization against homeless individuals. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the restaurant had a right to serve her unless she was a health hazard. The writers' actions in demanding her removal could be viewed as discriminatory. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the writers being in the wrong.\n"
