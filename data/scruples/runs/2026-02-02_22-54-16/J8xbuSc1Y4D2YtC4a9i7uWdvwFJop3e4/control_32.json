Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author went to a new Japanese restaurant with their dad. It was packed, and they were at the sushi bar. The food was good, and the chef was friendly. Then a homeless woman came in, sat next to them, started coughing, looked very dirty, and there was no one from the staff who said anything except brought her water. The author and their dad told the staff they'd leave if the woman wasn't removed. The staff apologized, escorted her out, and gave them a free roll, but they left without eating it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Homeless people often face discrimination and may not be treated with respect in public places. Restaurants have the right to enforce their policies, but if the woman was a customer, the staff should have addressed her condition if it was a health hazard. However, the author's actions might be seen as discriminatory if they didn't have a valid health concern. \n\nThe coughing: the user compared it to TB. TB is contagious through airborne particles, but unless the woman was visibly ill in a way that's clearly a risk (like coughing blood), it's possible the author overreacted. Also, if she was just coughing, maybe due to a cold or asthma, that's not a reason to kick her out. The smell and appearance might be off-putting, but that's a personal discomfort, not a wrong action by the restaurant. \n\nThe staff didn't say anything except give her water. That's a bit concerning because if someone is coughing like that, maybe they should be asked to cover their mouth or, in extreme cases, to leave if they're a health risk. But maybe the restaurant didn't want to be discriminatory. The author and dad demanded her removal, which could be seen as rude or classist. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt physically sick from the cough and smell, which is a legitimate reaction. They might have had a right to ask if the staff were concerned about health, but outright demanding her removal could be crossing a line. The restaurant did apologize and offer compensation, but the author left anyway. \n\nIs it the author's fault? They might have been inconsiderate, but maybe they were just trying to protect their health. However, the way they handled it\u2014telling the staff to remove her immediately\u2014could be seen as impolite and possibly discriminatory. There's no indication the woman was a threat, so the reaction might have been excessive. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't know she was homeless beforehand. They might have been genuinely concerned about her health. However, even if someone looks sick or unclean, it's the responsibility of the restaurant to manage such situations, not the customers. The customer's role is to request that the staff address it, not to demand the person's removal directly. \n\nSo the staff's inaction is questionable, but the author's response might be more about their discomfort than a justified health concern. Plus, the author left without eating, which could be seen as taking the free roll and then leaving to avoid the situation, but they didn't take it. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author's actions were based on the woman's appearance and coughing without any evidence of a contagious illness, that's more about their own prejudice. If they had a valid health reason, maybe not. But the story doesn't specify any staff action to address the issue, so the author might have felt they had to act. Still, perhaps they should have handled it differently, like asking to be seated elsewhere or talking to the manager more politely. \n\nThe key points are: the woman was a customer, the staff didn't act, the author demanded her removal, and then left. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might be seen as rude or judgmental, hence A. Alternatively, if the restaurant failed to address the issue, maybe the author was justified, so B. But I think the main issue is the assumption that the woman was a health risk based on her appearance, which could be considered discriminatory. So the answer is A.\n"
