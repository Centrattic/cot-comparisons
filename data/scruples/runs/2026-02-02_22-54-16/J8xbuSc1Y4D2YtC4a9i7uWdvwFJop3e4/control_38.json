Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, and a homeless person was served there. The woman was visibly unclean and coughing, which made the author and their dad uncomfortable. They demanded the restaurant remove her, and when she left, they left too, even after a free roll. The question is whether they are the asshole in this scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's policies. Restaurants are public places and are generally expected to serve all customers unless there's a specific policy against it. However, there might be health or safety concerns. The woman was coughing, which could be a health issue. But is that enough for the restaurant to remove her? Or is that up to the restaurant's discretion?\n\nThe author and their dad confronted the restaurant, demanding her removal. That part might be problematic because they were using their influence as customers to pressure the staff. However, if the woman was indeed a health risk, the restaurant might have been required to act. But the woman was just given a glass of water and not removed until the customers intervened. That could mean the restaurant didn't see an immediate threat, or maybe they were trying to be inclusive.\n\nThen there's the matter of how they reacted. The author felt sickened by the smell and appearance, leading them to leave. This could be seen as discriminatory or insensitive, especially if the restaurant was making an effort to serve all customers. However, the author's health and safety are also a consideration. The line between being reasonable and being judgmental can be thin here.\n\nThe restaurant's response was to apologize and give a free roll, which might indicate they felt responsible for the customer's discomfort. The fact that they eventually removed her suggests they might have agreed there was an issue. But the author's immediate reaction to leave after being offered a free roll could be seen as overreacting, especially if the restaurant was trying to make amends.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, the author might be seen as contributing to a culture where homeless individuals are not treated with dignity. However, the woman's appearance and cough might have posed a genuine concern, even if not malicious. The key here is whether the author's reaction was proportionate to the situation. Forcing the restaurant to remove a customer based on appearance without clear evidence of a health risk could be considered rude or discriminatory.\n\nOn the other hand, if the restaurant was in a sketchy area and the woman's presence made other customers uncomfortable, the restaurant might prioritize customer satisfaction. But the ethical angle is that everyone should be served regardless of their circumstances. The author might be in the wrong for not taking into account the woman's situation and for pressuring the restaurant, which could have repercussions for the homeless individual.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions might be perceived as judgmental and discriminatory. They should have perhaps addressed their concerns more sensitively, maybe by talking to a manager rather than demanding immediate removal. The fact that they left immediately after the woman was removed and didn't use the free roll might also be seen as dismissive of the restaurant's efforts. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
