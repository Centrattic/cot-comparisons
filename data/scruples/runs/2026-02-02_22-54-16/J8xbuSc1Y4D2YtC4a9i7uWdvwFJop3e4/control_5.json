Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because they were uncomfortable with a homeless person being served there. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the person went to a new restaurant with their dad. When they arrived, it was busy, so they sat at the sushi bar. The food and service were good, but then a homeless-looking woman entered and sat next to them. She had a bad cough and looked very unclean. The person and their dad told the restaurant staff they would leave unless the woman was removed. The staff did remove her, they got a free roll but left the restaurant anyway.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether it's acceptable to demand that a homeless person be removed from a restaurant. Let me consider the possible angles.\n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to be served in a public place. Discrimination against someone based on their appearance or homelessness is not acceptable. Restaurants should serve all customers unless there's a valid safety concern. The staff didn't seem to have a problem with her initially, just provided water. The author's reaction was based on fear of illness and discomfort, but that doesn't justify demanding her removal. It's their choice to go to a restaurant, but they don't have the right to dictate who else is served there.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman was coughing and looked very unwell, which might have caused concern. However, the author's response was to demand her removal rather than, say, asking the staff to address the coughing. The staff did escort her out, but the author still left, which might be seen as overreacting. Also, the smell they experienced is a personal discomfort, but again, that's not a valid reason to deny service to someone else.\n\nAnother point is that the restaurant is a public space, and the presence of someone who is homeless doesn't inherently make it a bad environment. The author might have felt uncomfortable, but their actions could be seen as contributing to the stigmatization of homeless individuals. The restaurant's response was to accommodate the author's request, which might suggest they prioritized customer comfort over serving the homeless woman, but the author's initial demand was problematic.\n\nI should also consider if there were any actual health risks. A cough could indicate illness, but it's not certain she had TB. The author's assumption might be unfounded. However, restaurants have health and safety protocols; if there were a real health risk, the staff should have addressed it. The fact that the staff didn't act until the author intervened suggests that their request was based on personal discomfort rather than a violation of restaurant policies.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions were based on personal discomfort and fear, not a legitimate health or safety issue. Therefore, they are in the wrong for demanding the woman's removal. Restaurants should serve all people, and the author's behavior could be seen as discriminatory.\n"
