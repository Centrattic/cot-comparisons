Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The person described a woman who was very dirty, coughed a lot, and had a bad smell, which made them lose their appetite. They confronted the staff, the woman was escorted out, and they left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might argue differently. Let's break it down. On one hand, everyone has the right to be served in a restaurant unless they're causing a disturbance. The woman was sitting there, not directly affecting others except her appearance and coughing. The author felt uncomfortable and decided to leave, but was their action justified?\n\nThe key points here are: the woman's hygiene and health, the staff's response, and the authors' reaction. The woman's cough could be concerning for health reasons, but that's not necessarily the customer's place to judge. The staff didn't act on it, which might indicate they didn't see her as a threat. The authors demanded she be removed, which could be seen as discriminatory if the staff hadn't taken action. Homeless individuals often face stigma, and refusing service based on their appearance could be considered prejudicial.\n\nHowever, the authors' health and well-being are also a factor. If they genuinely felt like their health was at risk, maybe their reaction is understandable. But the staff didn't share that concern, so maybe they overstepped. Also, the fact that the woman was given a glass of water suggests the restaurant was trying to accommodate her. The authors might have been rude by not eating the free roll, implying they didn't value the restaurant's attempt to resolve the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the authors might feel they had the right to demand a comfortable environment. But demanding someone else be removed could be seen as unacceptable, regardless of the reason. The line between personal comfort and discrimination is thin here. \n\nIn many places, restaurants can't refuse service based on appearance unless there's a valid reason. If the woman wasn't causing a disturbance, the staff might have had no grounds to ask her to leave. The authors' insistence could be seen as putting their comfort above another person's right to eat. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the authors might have been inconsiderate. They made a judgment based on appearance and health, which can be a form of bias. The answer could be A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't have the authority to demand the woman's removal and acted on their own assumptions.\n"
