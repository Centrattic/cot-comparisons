Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The main points are the appearance of the woman, her cough, the smell, and the restaurant's response.\n\nFirst, the woman was described as very dirty and coughing, which the author found disturbing. The restaurant didn't seem to intervene beyond giving her water. The author and their dad demanded her removal, which the staff complied with, but the authors left regardless.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally and ethically, can a restaurant ask someone to leave? Well, if someone is a health hazard or behaving disruptively, they can. A persistent cough might be seen as a health concern, especially in a food establishment. However, the woman was there and the staff didn't act until the authors intervened. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of judging someone based on appearance. The woman's dirtiness and smell might be due to homelessness, which is a social issue. The authors might be making assumptions about her health (TB), which could be a stretch. However, the restaurant's responsibility is to all customers' comfort and safety. If someone is visibly unclean and coughing, some might argue it's within their right to remove that person to prevent health risks.\n\nOn the other hand, the authors could be seen as discriminatory. They based their decision on the woman's appearance and perceived health risk, which might be prejudice against the homeless. The fact that the restaurant didn't initially act could suggest that the woman wasn't violating any rules, so the authors taking charge might be overstepping.\n\nBut the restaurant did eventually remove her, which implies they agreed there was an issue. The authors felt their health and comfort were compromised, leading them to leave. It's a balance between respecting others and protecting one's own well-being. \n\nIn many places, restaurants can set their own policies, but they must also consider public health codes. If the woman posed a real health risk (like a contagious illness), the restaurant has a duty to manage that. However, if the authors are overreacting due to bias, they might be in the wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the authors' actions were reasonable. Insisting on removal due to a perceived health risk could be justified if the restaurant didn't act. But if the woman wasn't a real threat, then the authors might be acting on fear rather than fact. \n\nI think the answer isn't black and white. The restaurant's initial inaction could mean they didn't see an issue, but their eventual compliance shows some validation. The authors might not be in the wrong if they felt their health was at risk, but they could also be showing bias. However, since the restaurant did remove her, their actions were in line with the staff's actions. So the authors aren't entirely in the wrong.\n"
