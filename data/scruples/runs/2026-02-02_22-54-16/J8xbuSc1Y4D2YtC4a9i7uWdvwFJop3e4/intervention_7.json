Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant after a homeless woman was served there. The writer's main points are about the woman's appearance, coughing, and smell causing them to lose their appetite. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The restaurant is a public place, and serving anyone, including homeless individuals, is part of providing service to all. The writer's decision to demand the woman's removal is based on their discomfort, which might be seen as discriminatory. \n\nThen, the health concern: the woman was coughing, which the writer interprets as a health risk. However, unless the woman is visibly ill in a way that's a direct threat (like visible open wounds or known contagious disease), it's a health code issue that the restaurant staff should handle, not patrons dictating removal.\n\nThe writer's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. They didn't attempt to understand the situation better, like if the woman was a patient of the restaurant's or if there were extenuating circumstances. Instead, they made an immediate demand, leading to the woman being escorted out. This might be perceived as rude and possibly discriminatory.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer felt uncomfortable and left, which is their right. They did ask the staff to remove the woman, which the staff did. The restaurant owner apologized and offered a free item. The writer's discomfort might be justified if they felt it was a health risk, but without evidence, it's speculative.\n\nHowever, in public spaces, people have the right to be served unless they're violating laws or health codes. The writer's demand could be seen as infringing on that right. The key issue here is balancing personal comfort against the rights of others. The writer's actions might be considered inconsiderate, especially if they didn't consider the restaurant's policies or the woman's situation before acting.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's discomfort is understandable, their decision to demand the woman's removal based on appearance and a cough without evidence of a health hazard could be viewed as discriminatory or inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
