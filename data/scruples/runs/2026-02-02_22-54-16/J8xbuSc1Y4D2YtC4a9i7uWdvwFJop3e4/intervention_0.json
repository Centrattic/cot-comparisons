Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) did the wrong thing by leaving the restaurant when a homeless person was served there. The situation involves the author and their dad being at a restaurant, then a sick, dirty woman comes in, and they demand her removal, leading to her being escorted out and them leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The restaurant is serving a homeless person, which is generally a positive thing. However, the woman is described as very dirty, coughing, and the smell is overwhelming. The author felt that the restaurant didn't address her presence, leading them to confront the staff and leave. \n\nOn one hand, the restaurant has a responsibility to serve all customers, regardless of their background. Turning away someone in need could be seen as discriminatory. The staff did give her a glass of water, which shows they at least acknowledged her presence. But the author felt uncomfortable and unsafe because of her appearance and coughing.\n\nBut then, is it right to demand someone else's removal from a public space? The author and their dad might be within their rights to ask for someone's removal if they believe it's a health risk, but the woman's cough could be a legitimate health concern. However, assuming someone has a disease like TB without confirmation isn't fair. Also, the act of confronting the staff and causing her to be kicked out might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she was just trying to get something to eat.\n\nThe author's response was extreme\u2014they left without eating the free roll, which could be seen as overreacting. The staff did apologize and offer compensation, which might have been enough. The main question is whether the author had the right to demand her removal. Public spaces are for everyone, and while health concerns exist, the proper approach would be to inform the staff quietly rather than make a scene.\n\nIn terms of social norms, being judgmental based on appearance is frowned upon. The author's description of the woman as \"dirtiest looking\" and the reaction to her smell might indicate a lack of empathy. Restaurants can't control who walks in, and it's their responsibility to serve all, unless there's a direct threat. The author's actions might have been necessary for their own comfort but at the expense of someone in need.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly in the wrong. They might have overstepped by demanding her removal without knowing her situation. The right approach would have been to inform the staff about their discomfort and let the restaurant handle it, rather than making a public demand. Therefore, the answer leans towards AITA being in the wrong.\n"
