Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant when a homeless person was served there. The scenario involves a homeless woman who was coughing and dirty, and the author and their dad demanded she be removed. The restaurant complied and even gave them a free roll, but they still left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The person is arguing that they were protecting their health and comfort. They mention the woman's cough sounded like TB and her being very dirty, which could be a health concern. However, others might argue that the restaurant had the right to serve anyone, and the customers shouldn't have demanded her removal.\n\nHomelessness is a social issue, and treating people with dignity is important. But is it wrong to ask for someone to be removed if they're making you uncomfortable? The restaurant did take action, so maybe the customers had a legitimate concern about health and safety. On the other hand, maybe the customers overreacted, and the restaurant should have handled it without customer intervention.\n\nThe restaurant's responsibility is to provide a safe environment for all customers. If the person was a health hazard, the restaurant should address it. But if the customers felt the need to demand removal, that could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the smell and coughing could be valid health concerns, but the way they confronted the staff might have been abrupt.\n\nI should check if there's a legal aspect here. In many places, businesses can ask someone to leave if they're causing a disturbance or a health risk. So if the staff didn't act, maybe the customers had a point in pushing for her removal. But if the staff was already handling it, maybe the customers were overstepping.\n\nBalancing personal comfort against others' rights is tricky. While the author had the right to leave, demanding someone else be removed based on their appearance and symptoms could be seen as discriminatory. However, if there's a legitimate health risk, it's a different scenario. The TB-like cough might be a valid concern if it's an actual health threat, but maybe the staff would have taken care of it without being asked.\n\nIn the end, the restaurant did apologize and give a free roll, so maybe they acknowledged the discomfort. The author left, which is their choice, but the act of demanding removal could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the staff didn't act and the customers felt it was necessary, maybe they were justified. It's a bit of a gray area. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were protecting their health, but there's a valid argument on the other side about not judging others.\n"
