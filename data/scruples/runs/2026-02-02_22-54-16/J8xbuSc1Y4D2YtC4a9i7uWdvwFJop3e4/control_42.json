Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving a restaurant because they were uncomfortable with a homeless person who was coughing and looked dirty. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the given text.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points are that the person and their dad went to a restaurant, the place was crowded, and a homeless woman sat next to them. She was coughing a lot and looked very dirty. The staff didn't do anything except bring her water. The person demanded the restaurant to remove her, they did, and the person left without eating, even though they were given a free roll.\n\nNow, the question is whether they are in the wrong. On one hand, everyone has the right to be in a public space, including a restaurant. The woman might have been in need of a place to rest, and the staff might have been following their policy or trying to be accommodating. The person's reaction was based on fear of illness (TB-like cough) and discomfort from her appearance. But is that a valid reason to demand she be removed?\n\nOn the other hand, the person is not a staff member and doesn't have the authority to tell the restaurant to remove someone. They might have felt their safety or comfort was compromised, but that's a subjective experience. The restaurant chose to remove her after being asked, which might indicate they considered the request. The person left, but the restaurant offered an apology and a complimentary item. However, the action of demanding her removal could be seen as judgmental or discriminatory, especially against someone who's homeless, which is a vulnerable group.\n\nThere's also the aspect of public health. If the cough was concerning, maybe the staff should have addressed it, but the person's immediate reaction was to confront the situation. It's possible they overreacted, but their fear might be real. However, the ethical consideration is whether it's right to ask for someone else to be removed from a public space based on appearance and perceived health, especially if there's no actual evidence of a contagious disease.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, the person might be seen as contributing to the marginalization of homeless individuals by treating them as a threat. But the other side is that people should have the right to feel safe in public spaces. It's a delicate balance. The restaurant's response (apologizing and removing the woman) might suggest they valued customer comfort over the woman's right to be there, which could imply that the customer's action was socially accepted in this context.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the person's action was justified. If the restaurant chose to remove the woman after the request, the person might not be entirely at fault. However, the act of demanding someone else's removal based on perceived health and appearance could be problematic. The person's discomfort is valid, but the method of addressing it (demanding removal) might be seen as inconsiderate or discriminatory. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a judgment based on appearance and demanded another person's removal from a public space without evidence of harm, which could be considered unethical.\n"
