Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about them leaving a restaurant because they were served a homeless person who was coughing and looked very unclean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant is in a sketchy area, but the reviews were good. The couple went there, had a good experience until a homeless woman sat next to them. The woman was coughing badly and looked dirty. The couple demanded she be removed, which she was, and then they left without eating the free food.\n\nNow, the key points here. The couple's actions: they asked the restaurant to remove the woman, which the staff did. They left because they felt uncomfortable. The question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, everyone has the right to be served in a public place. The woman was a customer, and the couple is asking to exclude her because of her appearance and symptoms. That could be seen as discriminatory. The restaurant didn't act on their request immediately, only after the couple threatened to leave. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple felt that their health was at risk due to the cough and smell. But the restaurant didn't have a policy to remove her, and the staff did bring her a glass of water. The couple's reaction might be seen as rude, especially if the woman was there by right. \n\nAlso, the couple left without finishing their meal. The sushi chef gave a free roll as an apology, but they didn't eat it. That could be seen as ungrateful. \n\nBut the couple's discomfort is real. They might have felt that the restaurant didn't take their concerns seriously. However, demanding the removal of a customer is a strong action. \n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong: if the restaurant didn't have a health issue with the woman, then the couple's request could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the woman was indeed ill and a health risk, the restaurant should have taken action. But the description says the cough sounded like TB, which is a serious disease. However, the restaurant didn't act until the couple demanded it. \n\nIn the end, the couple left because they felt uncomfortable, not necessarily because there was a violation of health codes. So their action might be considered inappropriate. The restaurant is a public space for all, and the couple's behavior could be seen as rude and discriminatory. Therefore, the answer would be A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
