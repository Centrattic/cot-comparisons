Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, and a homeless woman was served there. The woman was coughing and looked very dirty, which made the author and his dad uncomfortable. They told the restaurant to remove her, and when she was escorted out, they left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The restaurant is serving a homeless person, which is generally a positive thing, but the author felt it affected their dining experience. The key points are the actions taken by the author and their dad. They were direct, told the staff to remove the woman, and left when she was escorted out. \n\nHomelessness is a complex issue, and people have different views on it. The author's decision to leave might be seen as prioritizing their comfort over the restaurant's social responsibility. On the other hand, they might argue that they felt the woman's presence was unhygienic or a health risk, especially given the coughing and smell. However, the author's dad and they didn't ask the woman to leave themselves; they asked the staff to do it, which is within their rights as customers in some cases. But is it right to demand someone else be removed from a public space?\n\nThere's also the aspect of the restaurant's role. If the restaurant is open to the public, they have the right to serve anyone unless there's a specific rule against it. The staff didn't intervene initially, which might indicate they were okay with serving her. The author's request to remove her could be seen as discriminatory or as a health concern. However, the staff did take action, which might mean they agreed with the request.\n\nThe author left without eating, which could be seen as a strong reaction. Some might say that their discomfort doesn't justify making the restaurant remove a customer, especially a vulnerable one. Others might argue that if a customer is uncomfortable, they have the right to leave, though the method of demanding removal could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, there's a debate between personal comfort and societal responsibility. The author might be seen as privileged for expecting the restaurant to accommodate their preferences by removing someone else. The restaurant's apology and giving a free roll could be an attempt to make amends, but the author still left, which might be seen as unnecessary.\n\nAnother angle is the health aspect. The coughing and smell could be legitimate concerns, but the author didn't mention any staff addressing those issues before being asked. If the restaurant didn't take action, maybe they should have, but the author's demand to remove her could be seen as overstepping.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions involved asking to remove a homeless person from a public space, which could be seen as inconsiderate or discriminatory. While their discomfort is understandable, the method of resolving it by demanding her removal and then leaving might make them the asshole in the story. So the answer is likely A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
