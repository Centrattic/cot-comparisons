Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves them leaving a restaurant because a homeless person with a bad cough was served there. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The restaurant is a public place, and serving anyone is part of their policy. The homeless woman was there, and the patrons asked to have her removed. That could be seen as discriminatory or exclusionary because the restaurant should serve all customers regardless of their circumstances.\n\nNext, the health concern. The woman had a severe cough and was dirty, which the users found offensive. While health and safety are valid concerns, the responsibility lies with the restaurant. If the customer felt unwell, they could have asked management to address the situation, but demanding her removal might be overstepping. Also, the restaurant did provide a water and later escorted her out, which might indicate they handled it appropriately.\n\nThe social responsibility angle: the restaurant is in a \"sketchy\" area, so serving homeless people could be part of their community engagement. The customers' reaction might be seen as elitist or insensitive. However, the users were there for a meal and felt their experience was ruined. It's a balance between business ethics and customer satisfaction.\n\nLegal standpoint: In many places, restaurants can't discriminate against customers. The customers don't have the authority to demand someone else be removed unless there's a direct threat. So the restaurant had the right to handle the situation, but the customers may have overreacted.\n\nEmotional aspect: The user felt sick and left, which is understandable. But their action of demanding removal could be seen as inconsiderate towards the homeless person. The free roll and apology from the chef might not have been enough, leading them to leave, which could be justified if they felt uncomfortable, but not if they were rude.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the user is likely in the wrong because they asked the restaurant to remove a customer based on her appearance and health, which is not their right. The restaurant served her, handled the situation, and offered a gesture. The users' reaction was based on personal discomfort, which could be seen as discriminatory.\n"
