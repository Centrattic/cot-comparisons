Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they went to a new sushi restaurant with their dad. The place was packed, and they had a good experience at first. Then a homeless woman came in, sat next to them, had a bad cough, looked dirty, and the staff didn't do much except give her water. The author and dad told the staff to remove her or they'd leave, which they did. The woman was then escorted out, and they left, not touching the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The user is asking if they're the asshole for leaving because of a homeless person being served. But the key here is why they left. Was it because the staff didn't serve her, or because they were serving her and the author didn't like that? Wait, the title says \"for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person.\" But in the details, the staff did bring her a glass of water. So maybe the restaurant was serving her, but the author and dad were upset about her presence. The problem is that the woman was a customer, right? The restaurant is a public place, and serving homeless people isn't necessarily the same as allowing them in. But the author's reason for leaving might be based on her appearance and coughing, which they found off-putting.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's reasonable for the author to ask the staff to remove a customer just because she looked homeless and was coughing. On one hand, everyone should be allowed to eat in a restaurant, regardless of their appearance. Homelessness is a social issue, and restaurants should be inclusive. The staff might not be able to control how customers look, but they can provide service. On the other hand, if the woman was coughing violently and the staff wasn't addressing it, maybe there's a health and safety concern. However, the staff did bring her water. The author and dad might be concerned about contagious illness, but that's a risk in public places. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as discriminatory if they were removing her based on her homelessness. However, if they were worried about her coughing and potential health risk, that's a different angle. But the staff didn't seem to act on that either, just gave her water. The author's demand to remove her could be perceived as rude and possibly contributing to stigmatization. They left because of the smell and loss of appetite, which is understandable, but the reasoning might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the way they confronted the staff\u2014telling them to remove her or they'd leave\u2014might be seen as threatening or disrespectful. The staff apologized and escorted her out, so maybe they agreed it was an issue. However, some might argue that the staff should handle such situations without customer intervention. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the woman was a customer and the author's main issue was her being served, that's one thing. But the story says they left because she was there and the coughing/sight made them uncomfortable. The answer might depend on whether the staff is obligated to serve everyone, and if the customers overstepped by demanding her removal. The title mentions \"serving a homeless person,\" but the staff's action was minimal (just water). Maybe the author is not in the wrong if the woman wasn't a regular customer and the staff wasn't providing service beyond that. But if the restaurant was serving her even though she looked dirty and coughed, then the author's action might be seen as wrong. However, the staff didn't seem to provide much service except water, so maybe the author's action was acceptable. But the root of the problem is that the woman was homeless and they asked to be removed, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nAlternatively, if the staff was serving her but not doing anything about her coughing, which the author found alarming, maybe they were within their right to ask to be accommodated, like moving her seat or cleaning up, but demanding her removal is harsh. So the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) for potentially discriminatory behavior, or B (not in the wrong) if it was a health concern. But usually, in such cases, restaurants can't be picky about customers, so the author might be in the wrong. Also, the fact that they left immediately after she was removed might indicate that their main issue was her presence, not the health concern. The smell and coughing could be the reason they left, but if that's the case, it's their own discomfort. Still, demanding someone be removed just because they look homeless is problematic. So probably the answer is A.\n"
