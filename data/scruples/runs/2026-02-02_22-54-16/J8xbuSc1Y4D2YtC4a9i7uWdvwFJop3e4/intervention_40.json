Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant after a homeless woman was served there. The situation involves the woman being in a dirty state, coughing, and the author's discomfort leading to her being asked to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant is in a sketchy area but has good reviews. The woman walked in, sat at the bar, and the author and their dad felt uncomfortable. The staff didn't intervene immediately, so the customers demanded her removal. The staff then apologized and removed her, the author left without eating the free roll, and now they're asking if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is whether it's acceptable to ask a homeless person to leave a public place like a restaurant, especially when the customer is uncomfortable. Let's break it down.\n\nHomeless individuals have the right to be in public spaces, including restaurants, unless they're causing a disturbance. The woman in question was served, and the staff didn't remove her initially. The customers felt she was a health risk due to her appearance and coughing. However, just because someone looks homeless or is unclean doesn't automatically make them a threat. The staff's role is to manage the premises; if the woman wasn't causing a disturbance, the staff shouldn't have removed her based on customer complaints alone. But the customers did confront the staff, leading to her removal.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as long as the person isn't threatening others or breaking rules, they can't be forced out. However, businesses can ask people to leave if they're disruptive. The woman wasn't described as disruptive, just unclean and coughing. The customers might have had health concerns, but without evidence of contagious disease, it's a judgment call.\n\nEthically, it's a dilemma. The customers were in their right to feel uncomfortable, but the staff should have addressed it. The author's actions led to the woman being removed, which might be seen as discriminatory or judgmental. On the other hand, the staff didn't act, so the customers felt compelled to take action. The author might not be the sole wrongdoer, but their response could be seen as harsh or lacking empathy.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the customer's action was reasonable. Since the staff didn't act earlier, maybe the customers felt justified. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The staff should have handled it, but the customers' demand to have her removed might make them partly at fault. The author's discomfort is understandable, but their approach could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to weigh the options carefully.\n"
