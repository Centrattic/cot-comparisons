Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant after they saw a homeless woman being served. The scenario involves a couple dining at a new sushi restaurant, which they found to be great. Then a homeless woman enters, coughs violently, looks disheveled, and has a bad smell. The couple tells the staff to remove her, which they do, and then the couple leaves, not eating the free roll given to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The woman in question is homeless, which is a significant social issue. The couple's immediate reaction is to demand her removal, citing health concerns due to her cough and appearance. The restaurant didn't act until the couple intervened, which raises questions about their responsibility as a business to serve all customers regardless of their circumstances.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate against customers based on their appearance or homelessness. However, public health concerns might allow for some discretion, especially if there's a legitimate risk of spreading illness. The woman's cough could be a sign of a contagious disease like TB, which is a valid health risk. But the couple's assumption that she's sick without confirming might be hasty. \n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. On one hand, the couple is acting out of concern for their own health and comfort. On the other, they're making a judgment based on appearance and perhaps stigma around homelessness. The restaurant's role here is crucial. If they failed to serve the woman appropriately or ensure hygiene standards, they might share some responsibility. But the couple's direct approach to demand her removal could be seen as overstepping, as they're not employees and aren't responsible for the restaurant's policies.\n\nAnother angle is the societal treatment of homeless individuals. Choosing to leave a restaurant because of a homeless person's presence might reflect a lack of empathy or understanding. The couple might be projecting their discomfort onto the woman, assuming she's a risk without evidence. However, their actions were in response to their immediate environment and health concerns, which can be understandable, albeit problematic in how they approached it.\n\nThe restaurant's response is also telling. They didn't remove the woman until the couple insisted, which might indicate that they either didn't notice her condition or felt it was her right to be there. By then removing her, the restaurant might have been swayed by the couple's pressure, which could lead to the homeless woman being denied service. That's a concern because everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and have access to services, unless there's a clear and immediate health risk.\n\nIn terms of the couple's actions, they did escalate the situation by demanding immediate removal. While their health concerns might be valid, the way they handled it could be seen as dismissive of the woman's situation. They didn't give her the benefit of the doubt or allow the staff to handle it in their own way. Instead, they took it upon themselves, which might be seen as overstepping their role as customers.\n\nHowever, considering the environment of a restaurant, especially one that's packed, maintaining hygiene and customer comfort is important. If the woman's presence was causing discomfort or a real health risk, the restaurant should address it. The couple's decision to leave might be justified if they felt they couldn't enjoy their meal due to the situation, but forcing the restaurant to remove someone could be problematic if done without proper cause.\n\nIn summary, the couple's actions are a mix of self-preservation and potential bias. While they have the right to leave a restaurant for any reason, their insistence on removing the woman might have been based on assumptions rather than facts. The restaurant's responsibility is to balance serving all customers with maintaining safety. The couple's approach, while understandable in their discomfort, could be seen as contributing to the stigmatization of homeless individuals. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they made a hasty judgment and pressured the restaurant to remove a customer without sufficient evidence of a health risk, which could be discriminatory.\n"
