Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant because they were uncomfortable with a homeless person being served there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical perspective. The restaurant is a public place and should serve all customers regardless of their circumstances. The woman in question was homeless and possibly unwell, which raises questions about discrimination. The author and their dad demanded her removal, which could be seen as treating her poorly based on her appearance and health status.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's discomfort is understandable. The description of the cough and smell might have caused them to feel physically unwell, leading to their decision to leave. However, their reaction involved confronting the restaurant staff and demanding her removal, which might be seen as inappropriate. \n\nI should also consider the restaurant's responsibility. They did provide service (water) but didn't assist her further. The staff's lack of action might have contributed to the situation. However, the author's choice to leave was a personal decision based on their discomfort, which could be viewed as a failure to show empathy towards someone in a vulnerable situation.\n\nThe key points here are: treating everyone with respect regardless of appearance, the right to be served in public spaces, and the balance between personal discomfort and ethical responsibility. The author's actions may be seen as discriminatory because they asked for someone to be removed based on their appearance and health, which is a form of prejudice.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be Yes (A), the author is in the wrong for demanding the homeless woman's removal based on her appearance and health, which is discriminatory.\n"
