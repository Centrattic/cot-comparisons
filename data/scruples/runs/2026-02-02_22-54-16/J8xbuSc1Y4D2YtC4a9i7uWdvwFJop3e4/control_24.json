Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. The situation involves a homeless woman who came into the restaurant, was coughing, and the author and their dad demanded she be removed. The restaurant complied, and they left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications here. On one hand, the restaurant should provide service to all patrons regardless of their background, including homeless individuals. It's important to treat everyone with dignity and respect. The fact that the staff didn't serve her well or even approach her initially might be a problem. But the main issue here is the customers demanding her removal. \n\nThe author's reasoning was fear of illness due to the cough and the person's appearance, which they describe as dirty. However, making assumptions about someone's health based on appearance is problematic. Just because someone looks dirty or is homeless doesn't mean they have a contagious disease. The author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory, as they're targeting a vulnerable person based on their socioeconomic status. \n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to feel uncomfortable and choose where they want to spend money. But demanding another person to leave because of their appearance is where it crosses into being inconsiderate or even rude. The restaurant's role is to serve all customers, and if they removed her in response to the customers' demand, that's also an issue. However, the key here is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nThe author left the restaurant, which could be a personal choice, but the act of demanding the woman's removal is where the problem lies. It's possible that the author didn't consider the woman's rights to be served or the restaurant's responsibility. So, from a moral standpoint, the author might be in the wrong for treating the woman as a threat based on her appearance rather than as a customer deserving of service. Also, the reaction was based on fear and prejudice, not on actual health risks. The restaurant's response to remove her instead of addressing the customer's concerns might reflect poor management, but the customers' request was inappropriate. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions were likely inconsiderate and discriminatory, so the answer would be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
