Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user presented a situation where someone is asking if they're the a**hole for leaving a restaurant because they saw a homeless person being served. The person felt uncomfortable due to the woman's appearance and coughing, and they demanded she be removed. The restaurant complied but they still left.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants my opinion. First, I need to evaluate the scenario from different angles. The key points are: the restaurant is in a sketchy area, the woman's appearance and coughing made the author feel unwell, they were loud and smelly, even after being given water, no staff intervened beyond that. The author confronted the staff, got the woman removed, and left despite a free roll.\n\nNow, I have to decide if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the restaurant should serve all customers regardless of their background, including homeless individuals. The author's reaction could be seen as discriminatory based on appearance and health status. They might be violating the restaurant's policy of non-discrimination. Also, the woman might have been there through a community program or charity, which the restaurant is encouraging by serving her. The author's demand to remove her could be seen as rude and unwelcoming.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's condition was visibly unhygienic and potentially a health hazard. The author felt physically sick and was concerned about their own health. The staff didn't take any action, so maybe the author felt they had to speak up. However, the appropriate action might have been to inform the staff about their concern for health reasons, not to confront the woman directly. The smell and coughing could be due to various reasons, not just her being homeless. Also, the restaurant might not have the right to remove someone just because a customer is uncomfortable.\n\nBut the way the author handled it\u2014demanding removal and then leaving\u2014could be problematic. They might have been rude or aggressive, which is not appropriate. The fact that the staff didn't act before the author's confrontation suggests that the restaurant didn't see her as a threat. The author's actions might have caused the staff to feel they should have acted earlier. Additionally, the author's judgment based on appearance could be considered discriminatory, even if they were concerned about health.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal comfort and health. If the woman's condition was indeed a public health issue (like TB symptoms), the restaurant might have protocols in place. The author's reaction might be justified if they felt the restaurant was negligent in addressing a health risk. But the author didn't provide evidence that the woman was a health risk beyond the sound of the cough. TB is contagious but not transmitted through casual contact or coughing in a restaurant setting unless there's a specific reason to believe she's infectious, which the author didn't mention.\n\nSo, the main conflict here is between the right to serve all customers and the customers' right to feel safe and comfortable. The author's actions could be viewed as discriminatory, especially if they didn't approach the staff first. The correct step would be to politely ask the staff if they can address the situation, perhaps due to health concerns. If the staff had already assessed and found her safe, then the author might be overstepping. But if the staff ignored the issue, maybe the author had a right to be concerned. However, the author's immediate reaction to leave and ask for a free roll might be hasty.\n\nIn many places, businesses can ask a customer to leave if they're a threat or causing a disturbance, but the author didn't state that the woman was disruptive beyond her appearance and coughing. If the staff didn't find her disruptive but the author did, it's a matter of personal discomfort. The author might be in the wrong for making a judgment based on appearance and not giving the staff a chance to handle it. Also, the act of demanding removal and then leaving could be seen as not respecting the restaurant's hospitality and the dignity of the woman. The author's initial reaction could be considered harsh and lacking empathy.\n"
