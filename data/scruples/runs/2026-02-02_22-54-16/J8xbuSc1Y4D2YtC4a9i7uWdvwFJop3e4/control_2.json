Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for leaving a restaurant because they were serving a homeless person. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The person and their dad went to a new sushi restaurant. It was packed, so they sat at the bar. The food was great, but then a homeless-looking woman with a bad cough sat next to them. The person felt uncomfortable because of her appearance and the cough. They told the staff to remove her, which they did. Then they left without eating the free roll and the sushi chef apologized.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the restaurant should serve all customers, regardless of their background. Homeless individuals may be in vulnerable situations, and refusing service or expelling them could be discriminatory. The person might be seen as contributing to that discrimination by pressuring the staff to remove her.\n\nOn the other hand, the person felt physically uncomfortable and unwell due to the cough and smell. Health concerns might be a valid reason, but if the restaurant didn't take action on their own, maybe the person is overstepping. However, the staff did eventually remove the woman, which suggests they might have had their own health concerns or policies.\n\nBut the key issue here is the person's right to request the removal versus the restaurant's responsibility to serve all customers. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on appearance, but they can ask someone to leave for health and safety reasons. However, the woman didn't pose an immediate threat; the person assumed she was sick based on the cough. The smell and dirt might be a sign of poor hygiene, but without confirmation of a health risk, it's subjective.\n\nThe person's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, prioritizing their own comfort over someone else's right to service. They might be contributing to stigma against homeless individuals. However, if the restaurant didn't take action on their own, maybe the staff's inaction is also part of the problem. The person might not be entirely wrong, but they could have handled it differently, like asking the staff to check if the woman needed help instead of demanding her removal.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the homeless woman's rights and made an assumption about her health. They should have communicated concerns differently or checked in with the staff first without demanding her ejection. Their actions might have been more about their own discomfort than actual health risks, leading to discriminatory behavior.\n"
