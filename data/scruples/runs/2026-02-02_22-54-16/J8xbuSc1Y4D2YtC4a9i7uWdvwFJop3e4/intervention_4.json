Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving the restaurant after they saw a homeless woman being served. The writer mentions that the woman was coughing, looked very dirty, and had a bad smell, which made them lose their appetite. They told the restaurant to remove her or they would leave, and when she was escorted out, they left without eating the free roll.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, the restaurant should serve all customers regardless of their background, promoting inclusivity. The woman might have been in a vulnerable situation, and the restaurant's responsibility is to serve all patrons. The writer's reaction could be seen as discriminatory, focusing on appearance and health, which might not be fair. However, the writer was concerned about their health due to the cough and smell, which is a natural reaction. \n\nBut is their action justified? Insisting on removing someone from the restaurant because they look different or are homeless could be seen as inconsiderate. The restaurant didn't immediately act on the request, which might indicate they were trying to handle it. The writer's threat to leave could be seen as using their own discomfort to pressure the restaurant, which might not be the right approach. However, the woman wasn't causing any direct harm or violating any rules beyond perhaps health and safety concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant did eventually remove her, so maybe they had their own reasons. The smell and cough might be legitimate health concerns, but the way the author reacted\u2014demanding removal\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate towards the homeless person. \n\nSo, the key points: Discrimination based on appearance, health concerns vs. inclusivity, the right to refuse service, and the restaurant's handling of the situation. The author's action of leaving might be understandable in terms of their personal comfort, but their initial demand could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) for not considering the homeless person's rights and for pressuring the restaurant. However, some might argue that it's not their place to judge. The restaurant's responsibility to serve all customers is a strong point against the author's actions. So, probably A is the answer.\n"
