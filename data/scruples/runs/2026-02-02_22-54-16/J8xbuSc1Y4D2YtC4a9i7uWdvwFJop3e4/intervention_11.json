Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a new restaurant with their dad. They were enjoying their meal when a homeless woman came in. She was coughing badly, looked very dirty, and smelled awful. The couple told the staff to remove her, and when they did, the customers left without eating the free roll offered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the customers had the right to feel uncomfortable. If someone is visibly sick and in a public place, it's understandable that others might be concerned about health or safety. The staff didn't intervene initially, which might have prompted the customers to speak up. However, forcing a restaurant to remove a patron could be seen as discriminatory. Homeless people deserve basic respect and access to public spaces unless they're causing a disturbance. The woman was just sitting there, coughing, and the staff did bring her water. The customers didn't ask her to leave but told the staff to remove her. \n\nNow, the question is whether this action was wrong. Restaurants can ask people to leave if they're a health hazard or disruptive, but the line is thin. The customer's reaction was based on personal discomfort rather than an actual threat. The smell and coughing might have been a legitimate health concern, but that's subjective. The person might be in a vulnerable situation, and the customers' response could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the flip side, the customers paid good money for a meal and felt their experience was ruined. They might have a right to request that the staff address the situation. However, the method of confronting the staff and leaving immediately might have been abrupt. The staff did apologize and offer a free item, but the customers left regardless.\n\nI think the key points are: the customer's own discomfort vs. the rights of the homeless person. There's a balance between personal hygiene concerns and treating others with dignity. The customers might not be the sole assholes if they genuinely felt threatened, but their action could be seen as inconsiderate towards someone in need. The staff's inaction might also be part of the problem if they didn't address the situation earlier. But the customers' response was to demand removal, which could be viewed as disrespectful. So, maybe they are in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
