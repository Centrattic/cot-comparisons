My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author correcting their sister's boyfriend by stating he's not family.\n\nFirst, the author's sister is dating someone for less than three months. The boyfriend has made dangerous decisions, like drunk driving with her in the car and exposing her to a dangerous ex-felon. The author is concerned but has kept their opinions to themselves until now.\n\nThe key issue is the boyfriend calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author interprets as the boyfriend trying to be part of the family. The author then tells him he's not family, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main concern is their sister's safety. The boyfriend's actions are indeed risky, so the author's intent is protective. However, the way they addressed it might come off as abrupt or dismissive, potentially harming the relationship with the sister.\n\nWas the author in the wrong? They have a valid concern about safety, but the method of addressing it by directly confronting the boyfriend could be seen as overstepping, especially since the sister's choice in partners is her own. However, the author's intent was to set boundaries due to legitimate safety concerns. The boyfriend's behavior in trying to get too close might have crossed a line, so the author's response was a boundary-setting action. It's a gray area, but considering the context of protecting a family member from potential harm, the author might not be entirely at fault. The answer would depend on whether the approach was appropriate, but given the safety risks, the author's actions could be justified.\n"
