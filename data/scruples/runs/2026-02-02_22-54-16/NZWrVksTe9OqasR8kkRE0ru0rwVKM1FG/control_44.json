My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister has been dating someone for under three months. The writer thinks he's not trustworthy because of dangerous actions\u2014like drunk driving with her in the car and exposing her to a scary ex-felon. The boyfriend has started calling him \"brother\" and being overly familiar. The writer finally tells him he's not family, which upset the sister.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the key points. The writer's intent was to set boundaries because they were uncomfortable with the boyfriend's behavior and his closeness. They had kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they tried to avoid conflict. The boyfriend's actions were risky, and the writer's sister might be in danger. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer's approach was direct and might have come off as harsh. It's possible the sister felt her boyfriend was being criticized, leading to her not contacting the author. But the writer's concern is for their sister's well-being. \n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Maybe, but the main issue is the boyfriend's behavior. The writer isn't wrong for wanting to protect their sister. They didn't confront the sister's choice in partner but the boyfriend's actions. The line about not being family was to set boundaries, not to insult. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because their actions were to protect their sister and set boundaries against someone who's putting her at risk.\n"
