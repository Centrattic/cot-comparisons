My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the sister dating someone for under three months, and the author has concerns about the guy's behavior\u2014like drunk driving and hanging around a dangerous ex-felon. The author kept their opinions to themselves but finally told the boyfriend he's not family after he started calling them brother and being overly familiar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's actions were a direct response to the boyfriend's behavior. The boyfriend was showing up uninvited, attaching himself, and using familial terms. The author felt this overstepped, especially given the dangerous situations the boyfriend had put their sister in. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries. It's their home and their personal space. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as intrusive, and the author might feel threatened by the potential danger the boyfriend represents. Also, the author is protecting their sister by trying to keep her away from someone they see as a risk.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might have been trying to build a relationship with the family, which is common. The author's response was pretty blunt. Maybe there was a better way to handle it without causing tension. However, the author did mention that they had kept their opinions to themselves until now. The direct confrontation might have been a last resort.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also a factor. The author hasn't heard from her since, which suggests the sister might be upset. But the author's main goal was to set a boundary, not to harm the relationship. The boyfriend's actions included risky behaviors that could endanger the sister, so the author's concern is valid.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had reasons to be cautious, and setting a boundary is reasonable. The answer would be B (No).\n"
