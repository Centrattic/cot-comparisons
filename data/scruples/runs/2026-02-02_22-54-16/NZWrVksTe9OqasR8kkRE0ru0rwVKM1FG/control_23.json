My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy telling his sister's boyfriend that he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author doesn't like the guy, thinks he's making dangerous choices\u2014like drunk driving with his sister and hanging out with a known ex-felon. The author has kept his opinions to himself until now, but the boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. So the author told the boyfriend he's not family, just the guy his sister is dating. Now the sister hasn't talked to the author since.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting his sister. The boyfriend's actions are dangerous, and the author has a right to be concerned. It's his sister's choice to date whom she wants, but the author is worried about her safety. The boyfriend's behavior is risky, so the author might feel justified in making his disapproval known to him directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't confront the sister first. He went straight to the boyfriend. That might have been a harsh move, especially since the sister's autonomy in choosing her partner is important. The author's comment could be seen as disrespectful to the boyfriend, even if the author's intentions were protective. The sister might feel that her partner was being criticized without her input, leading to the fallout in their communication.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend is trying to get close to the family, which is common in relationships. The author's response might have been a shock to the system, especially if the sister didn't expect her brother to speak out like that. The author might have overstepped by directly addressing the boyfriend instead of talking to his sister first.\n\nBut then again, the boyfriend's actions are dangerous. The drunk driving and associating with a known felon are serious issues. The author could be trying to prevent harm to his sister. Even though it's the sister's choice, the author has a right to express concern, especially if the sister is in a vulnerable position.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as a protective measure, even if it came off as confrontational. The key issue is whether the author had the right to intervene directly. Since the boyfriend's behavior is harmful, the author's intent was to protect his sister, which is a valid concern. However, the method of confrontation might have been inappropriate because it didn't involve the sister first, leading to the sister being upset.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intentions are good, but the execution might have been flawed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's actions are dangerous and the author is acting in his sister's best interest, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. He's addressing legitimate safety concerns, even if the approach could have been better handled through communication with his sister first.\n"
