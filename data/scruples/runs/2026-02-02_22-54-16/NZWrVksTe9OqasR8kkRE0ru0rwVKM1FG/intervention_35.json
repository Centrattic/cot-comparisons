My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" The situation is that the sister has been dating this guy for less than three months, and the author has concerns about his behavior\u2014drunk driving with her in the car, associating with a scary ex-felon, etc. Despite that, the author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which made them uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author acted appropriately. The key points here are the author's actions and the context. The author's main issue is the boyfriend's use of familial terms and his overstepping by showing up uninvited and being overly attached. The author did confront him, but it was in response to specific behaviors that made them uncomfortable. They didn't attack the boyfriend for dating their sister, just clarified their relationship boundaries.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's intentions: he's probably trying to integrate into the family, which is a common thing in relationships. However, the author might feel that the boyfriend is too quick to assume a family role without the sister being in a serious relationship. The author's message was clear but firm, which could be seen as necessary to set boundaries, especially given the boyfriend's risky behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have handled it more diplomatically. Maybe using a different approach to set boundaries without being so direct, or discussing it with the sister first. But the author did mention they kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they were trying to respect their sister's choice. The confrontation was about the boyfriend's behavior towards them, not about the relationship itself.\n\nThe fact that the sister hasn't been in touch since might indicate tension, but the author's action was about their own discomfort with the boyfriend's familiarity, not necessarily disapproving the relationship. So, the author isn't wrong for setting personal boundaries. The answer is probably B, No.\n"
