My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation: the sister has been dating this guy for under three months, and the author has issues with his behavior\u2014drunk driving with her in the car, exposing her to a dangerous ex-felon to buy drugs. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited, being overly familiar, calling them brother and fam. The author then confronted him, leading to their sister not talking to them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the boyfriend's risky behavior and the author's response. The author's concern is about their sister's safety, which is valid. The boyfriend's actions are dangerous and potentially harmful, so the author has a right to be worried. However, the author acknowledges that it's the sister's choice who she dates and has been respectful until now.\n\nThe confrontation happened when the boyfriend was overstepping, using familial terms. The author's statement was direct but not aggressive. The boyfriend didn't react negatively, just said \"alright.\" The sister hasn't contacted the author since, which might be due to her being upset, but the author's intention was to set boundaries, not to be hostile. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're protecting their sister's safety and setting clear boundaries about their relationship. While it's possible the boyfriend felt slighted, the author had a legitimate reason to correct the familial label, especially given the short duration of the relationship and the boyfriend's questionable actions. The sister's reaction is unknown, but the author's actions seem to be about safety and clarifying their role. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
