My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe author's sister has been dating someone for less than three months. The author thinks the boyfriend is an idiot and made dangerous choices, like drunk driving and hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now because they respect their sister's choice. However, the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. The author finally told him, \"You\u2019re not my family. You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\" The boyfriend just said \"alright,\" and the author walked away. Now the sister hasn't contacted them since.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is concerned about their sister's safety due to the boyfriend's actions. They mention dangerous behavior like drunk driving with the sister in the car and associating with a known ex-felon to purchase drugs (though it's not confirmed if it's actually pot). These are serious concerns that could put the sister at risk. \n\nThe author has refrained from interfering before, respecting their sister's choice. But the boyfriend's behavior of showing up uninvited, being overly familiar, and using family terms like \"brother\" and \"fam\" has pushed the author to set a boundary. The author's statement was to clarify that the boyfriend isn't family but the current boyfriend, which seems like a firm boundary to prevent the boyfriend from overstepping.\n\nNow, the ethical aspect here is whether the author overstepped by directly confronting the boyfriend. On one hand, the author has legitimate safety concerns and is trying to protect their sister. On the other hand, the author is not the boyfriend's parent and might have overstepped by being so direct and dismissive. However, the boyfriend's actions\u2014like showing up uninvited and being overly familiar\u2014might have warranted the author's response. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior of calling the author \"brother\" could be seen as inappropriate, especially without the author's consent. The author might feel that the boyfriend is trying to infiltrate the family dynamic too quickly, which could be a red flag. \n\nThe sister not contacting the author after this might indicate that the sister is upset, possibly because her boyfriend was reprimanded. But the author's intention was to protect her and set boundaries, which could be justified given the boyfriend's dangerous tendencies.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's primary intent was to protect their sister and set a boundary regarding the boyfriend's overfamiliar behavior. The author didn't accuse the boyfriend of anything illegal but clarified their relationship status. While the approach might have been harsh, the underlying concerns are valid. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, so the answer could be B. However, there's a possibility that the author should have discussed the concerns with the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. But given the boyfriend's actions (uninvited visits, overfamiliarity), the author's response might be justified as a boundary set. \n\nI think the key here is the balance between respecting the sister's autonomy and addressing the boyfriend's overreach. The author's actions were a boundary set, not an attack on the relationship itself. So the answer is likely B.\n"
