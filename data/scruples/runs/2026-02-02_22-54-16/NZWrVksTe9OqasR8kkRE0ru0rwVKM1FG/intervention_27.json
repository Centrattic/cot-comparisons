My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me look at the details.\n\nThe sister's boyfriend is young, made some risky choices, like drunk driving with her in the car and exposing her to a dangerous ex-felon. The author is concerned for their sister's safety. But they kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started coming over uninvited, being overly familiar by calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which made the author uncomfortable. So the author told him bluntly he's not family, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the author's perspective, they're trying to protect their sister and set boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are risky, and the author is asserting their discomfort with the familiarity. However, maybe the author could have approached it differently, like discussing it with the sister first. But given the situation, the author's main concern is safety, and they did address the inappropriate behavior directly. The answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
