My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating him for under three months, and the writer has issues with his behavior, like drunk driving with her in the car and associating with an ex-felon. They didn't express their concerns before because they thought it was her choice.\n\nNow, the key points here. The boyfriend was calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and felt was overstepping. The author then told him he's not family, which might have upset the sister. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, the author's concern is about the boyfriend's dangerous actions, which are valid. The sister's safety is a priority. However, the author chose to keep their opinions to themselves except for this one statement. The boyfriend might be trying to be inclusive, but the author's reaction was direct. The question is whether the author overstepped by confronting him like that, especially since it's the sister's choice who she dates. But the author's main point is about the relationship boundaries, not the sister's choice. \n\nThe boyfriend showing up unannounced and being overly familiar could be seen as intrusive. The author's response, while blunt, might be justified to set boundaries. The sister not responding since could indicate tension, but the author's intent was to clarify the relationship status, not to interfere in the dating aspect. \n\nI think the author is in the right to assert their boundaries, especially given the boyfriend's actions. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
