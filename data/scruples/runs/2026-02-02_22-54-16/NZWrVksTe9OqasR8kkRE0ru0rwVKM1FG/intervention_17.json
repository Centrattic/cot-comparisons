My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B. \n\nFirst, the situation: The sister has been dating someone for under three months. The author thinks he's immature and has made dangerous choices, like drunk driving with her and hanging out with a dangerous ex-felon. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which made the author uncomfortable. So the author told him he's not family but the guy she's dating.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that even though the sister chose to date him, the boyfriend's behavior is risky. The author is concerned about his sister's safety and is trying to set boundaries. The boyfriend just responded with \"alright\" and the author walked away. Now the sister hasn't heard from her sister since.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to protect their sister and set clear boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are indeed concerning, and the author might not want the guy to feel like part of the family, especially given the risks. On the other hand, the boyfriend was trying to be friendly and integrate into the family, which is common. The author's message might have been harsh, but it's about safety and boundaries. \n\nIs it wrong to correct someone's perception of their relationship status? The author didn't attack him personally but clarified their status to prevent the boyfriend from getting too close. The key points are the sister's choice to date him, the author's right to set boundaries, and the boyfriend's inappropriate actions. The author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in their sister's best interest and maintaining family boundaries. The answer should be B for No.\n"
