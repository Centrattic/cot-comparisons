My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family, especially since their sister has only been dating him for less than three months. The author has issues with the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, like driving drunk with the sister in the car and associating with a scary ex-felon to buy drugs. They kept their opinions private until the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed them. The author then directly told the boyfriend he's not family, leading to their sister not talking to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's sister is in a relationship, and the boyfriend is trying to be friendly with the family. The author is concerned about the boyfriend's behavior but respects their sister's choice. The main issue is the boyfriend using familial terms, which the author found inappropriate. The author's response was to correct him, which the sister might have taken as a negative action.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. So, I should analyze if the author overstepped. The boyfriend's actions are indeed problematic\u2014drunk driving and exposure to a known ex-felon with a criminal background. However, the author's sister is an adult making her own choices, even if they're questionable. The author's right to voice their concerns exists, but the timing and method matter.\n\nUsing the term \"family\" was a direct confrontation. The author could have approached the boyfriend in a more private and constructive way, perhaps discussing the safety concerns first. By focusing on the familial term, the author might have come across as dismissive or hostile, which could explain why the sister is upset. However, the author has the right to set boundaries, especially in a family context. The boyfriend's actions do pose risks, so the author's concern is valid. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the main issue is the use of the term \"fam\" and the direct correction, maybe. But if the boyfriend was overstepping by being around the sister's family too much and showing undue familiarity, the author's actions are a reasonable boundary. The author's sister might need to address the boyfriend's behavior independently, but the author isn't necessarily wrong to set a clear line. \n\nThe answer would depend on cultural norms around family interactions and how the message was delivered. However, given the boyfriend's risky behavior and the sister's choice to date him despite that, the author's response might be seen as necessary to protect their sister and family. The key is that they didn't try to interfere with the relationship itself, just corrected the boyfriend's overfamiliarity. So, the author is probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
