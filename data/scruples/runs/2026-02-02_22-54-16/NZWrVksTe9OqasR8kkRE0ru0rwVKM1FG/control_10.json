My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not \"family.\" The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author has some issues with the guy's behavior: drunk driving, exposing their sister to a dangerous ex-felon, etc. The author kept their opinions to themselves but got annoyed when the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then told the boyfriend he's not family, which led to the sister not talking to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author overstepped. The key points here are the author's justification for their actions. They mention that the boyfriend's actions are dangerous, but they've kept their opinions to themselves until now. The issue here is the boyfriend trying to be part of the family, which the author is not comfortable with. The author's statement was meant to set a boundary, right?\n\nBut the sister might feel that her boyfriend is trying to connect with her family, and the author's harsh response could be seen as rude or dismissive. However, the author's concerns about the boyfriend's behavior are valid. The boyfriend's actions are risky, and the author might be trying to protect their sister. But the way the author communicated this might have been abrupt. Instead of just saying he's not family, maybe there's a more diplomatic way to handle it. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author's intention was to set a boundary, not to be hostile. The boyfriend's actions crossing into the family space (showing up unannounced, attaching himself during visits) could justify the author wanting to draw a line. The author isn't forbidding the relationship but is clarifying their own relationship status. The sister's reaction is that she hasn't spoken to the author since, which indicates she might be upset, but that's more about her response than the author's rightness. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author had valid concerns and was protecting their sister, but the method could have been handled better. However, asserting one's own boundaries isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's behavior was pushing into family space, so the author's response was a way to correct that. So the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were setting a boundary based on their own comfort and protecting their sister's family dynamics, even if the approach was a bit blunt.\n"
