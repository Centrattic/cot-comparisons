My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The user says they think the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, the situation: the sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author thinks he's an idiot, maybe because he's young. But the main issue is the guy's risky behavior\u2014driving drunk with the sister in the car, hanging out with a known ex-felon to get drugs. The author is concerned for their sister's safety. They've kept their opinions to themselves so far, respecting her choice. But now the guy is trying to befriend the author, calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" showing up uninvited. The author snaps and tells him he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. Now the sister hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nSo, the author's actions. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The sister's boyfriend was overstepping by being pushy and trying to ingratiate himself. The author felt uncomfortable with the familiarity and the lack of boundaries. The author's concern is valid because the guy's actions are dangerous. The sister made her choice to date him, but the author is not obligated to be friends with him. By setting a boundary, the author is protecting their own comfort and possibly their sister's well-being. \n\nBut is it wrong to say that? The author didn't attack him personally; they just clarified their relationship. The boyfriend might have misread the friendliness, but the author's response was direct. The sister might be upset because the boyfriend is part of her life, but the author isn't in a position to be best friends with him unless the sister invites that. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more diplomatically. But given the circumstances\u2014sister's safety, the boyfriend's behavior\u2014it's reasonable to set that boundary. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. So answer B.\n"
