My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author doesn't like him because he's young and made dangerous choices, like driving drunk with her sister and exposing her to an ex-felon. The boyfriend started calling him brother and fam, which annoyed the author. They told him he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. The sister hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main concern is for their sister's safety and well-being. The boyfriend's actions are risky, and the author is worried. However, the author is trying to keep their opinions to themselves, which is a sign of respect for their sister's autonomy. The issue arises when the boyfriend starts to overstep by trying to get too close, using familial terms, and showing up uninvited. The author confronts him to set boundaries, which is a common reaction when someone feels that their space is being invaded.\n\nBut is it wrong to tell someone they're not family? Well, family terms can be tricky. Sometimes people use them casually, but in this context, the boyfriend is trying to gain a familial status, which the author is not comfortable with. The author's action is a boundary setting, not an attack. The boyfriend's behavior might be overstepping, and the author is asserting that their relationship is only through the sister. The sister's silence might be due to feeling that the author is interfering in her relationship, but the author's intent was to protect her from someone they see as a risk.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel disrespected or dismissed. The author didn't confront the sister first, which could have been a better approach. However, the situation might have escalated if the author didn't act. The key points are the safety concerns and the boundaries. The author is in a tough spot, trying to balance concern for their sister with not overstepping their own role. Since the author's actions were direct but not aggressive, and the main concern is valid, it's more about setting a boundary than being in the wrong. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
