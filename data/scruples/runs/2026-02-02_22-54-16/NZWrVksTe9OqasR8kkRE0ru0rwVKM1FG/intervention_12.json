My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend has been in a relationship for less than three months. The author is concerned about the guy's behavior: driving drunk with the sister in the car, associating with an ex-felon to buy drugs, and making dangerous choices. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which made the author feel uncomfortable. The author then told the boyfriend he's not family, which probably upset the sister.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author did the right thing. The boyfriend's actions are indeed risky and concerning. The author is protecting their sister, which is a natural instinct. However, the way the author addressed the issue could be seen as abrupt. By directly stating he's not family, it might come off as harsh, even if the intentions were good. The key points here are the boyfriend's behavior versus the method of addressing it.\n\nThe author's decision to speak up might be justified because they were trying to set boundaries. The boyfriend's attempts to be close might have been overstepping, especially given the short time they've been dating. The author's statement was a clear boundary, but it's possible they could have handled it more tactfully to avoid hurting the sister. However, the core issue is the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, which the author has a right to address for their sister's safety.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's intentions were to protect their sister and set boundaries. The method might not have been perfect, but the intent wasn't malicious. So the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
