My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family, after the boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam.\" There are some underlying issues here.\n\nFirst, the sister has been dating the guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014like driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging out with a known ex-felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves up until now. The boyfriend, however, has been showing up uninvited, being overly familiar, and using familial terms. The author finally confronts him, leading to a tense moment and possible fallout with the sister.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions (driving drunk, associating with a dangerous person) are concerning. The author is trying to protect their sister, which is understandable. However, the approach taken might be problematic. Telling someone they aren't family in a direct manner, especially after they've been making efforts to bond with the family, could come off as hostile or dismissive. The author might have wanted to set boundaries without being confrontational. \n\nThe key points here are the intention behind the author's action and the context of the relationship. The author's main concern is valid because the boyfriend's behaviors are risky. But the way they addressed it could have been more tactful. Instead of a blunt statement, maybe a private conversation with the sister first or a more diplomatic approach with the boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions of trying to integrate into the family might be well-meaning, but the author has the right to feel uncomfortable. However, the method of confrontation might have been too harsh, leading to the sister cutting off communication. The author's responsibility is to their sister's well-being, but they should also consider how their actions affect the family dynamics and the sister's autonomy in her relationship.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intentions are protective, but the execution might be flawed. The boyfriend's actions are concerning, but the author's response could have been more constructive. So, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they are addressing valid safety concerns, their approach might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be a nuanced \"Yes\" because the method could have been better handled, even if the intent was good.\n"
