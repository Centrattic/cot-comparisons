My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend did some dangerous things: drunk driving with her in the car and associating with an ex-felon. The author is concerned about their sister's safety and isn't happy about the guy's behavior. But since it's the sister's choice, they've kept their opinions to themselves so far. \n\nNow, the boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" showing up uninvited, and being overly familiar. The author felt this was overstepping and told him he's not family. The sister hasn't spoken since, so there's tension.\n\nThe key points here: the author's actions were to set boundaries, not to interfere with the relationship per se. The boyfriend's actions are risky, so the author is acting out of concern for their sister. However, the method of communication might have been harsh. Telling someone they're not family could come off as dismissive or rude, even if the intent was protective.\n\nBut the boyfriend's behavior was crossing boundaries by trying to be part of the family without being asked. The author might have a right to voice their discomfort, especially given the dangerous situations. However, maybe a more tactful approach could have been better, like talking to the sister first or addressing the issue privately with the boyfriend without the \"not family\" comment.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The author's intent was protective, but the way they expressed it might have been abrupt. The boyfriend might feel disrespected. However, the author isn't the one engaging in dangerous behavior. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But considering the context, the author's actions were a boundary-setting response to the boyfriend's overstepping, even if the delivery was harsh. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they were trying to protect their sister and set boundaries, even if the approach was a bit direct.\n"
