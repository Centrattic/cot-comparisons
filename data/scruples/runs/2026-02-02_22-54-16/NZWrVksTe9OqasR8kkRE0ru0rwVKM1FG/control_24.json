My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" The situation involves the sister dating someone for under three months, and the author has concerns about the guy's behavior\u2014drunk driving with her in the car, associating with an ex-felon known for being scary, and buying drugs. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and felt was overstepping. The author then told him directly that he's not family, leading to the sister not speaking to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the boyfriend's dangerous actions and the author's response. The author's main issue is that the boyfriend is trying to be part of the family, but the author feels he's not a good influence. The author says they kept their opinions to themselves until now, so they had a history of not voicing concerns but this time felt it necessary.\n\nThe boyfriend showing up at the author's apartment and attaching himself when the author visits their mom might be seen as trying to integrate into the family, which the author is uncomfortable with. The author's statement \"You\u2019re not my family. You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\" is direct but not necessarily hostile. They might be trying to set boundaries.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The sister has the right to date whomever she chooses, but the author is concerned about her safety. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person) are valid concerns. However, the way the author addressed it might be seen as abrupt. Instead of being confrontational, maybe a more private or gentle approach would have been better to avoid hurting their sister's feelings. But the author's main point was to correct the boyfriend's assumption that he's family, which the author clearly isn't comfortable with. \n\nThe sister's reaction (not speaking since) suggests that the author's message might have come off as harsh, especially considering the short duration of the relationship. However, the author's intention was to set boundaries, not to attack the boyfriend. The question is whether the author's actions were justified given the safety concerns and the need to maintain clear boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were addressing a boundary issue and safety concerns. However, maybe the execution could have been handled better. But the core issue is the boyfriend overstepping, so the author's response is understandable.\n"
