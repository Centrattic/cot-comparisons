My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not \"family\" after some concerning behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister is dating someone for less than three months. The author has issues with the boyfriend's actions: drunk driving with the sister in the car, associating with a dangerous ex-felon to buy drugs. The author hasn't said anything before because they respect the sister's choice. But the boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. So they told him he's not family, leading to the sister not contacting them since.\n\nNow, considering if the author is wrong. The main conflict is between the author's concern for their sister's safety and the sister's autonomy in choosing her partner. The author acted out of concern, which is a valid reason. However, the way they addressed it might be seen as harsh. Telling someone they're not family could be hurtful, especially if the boyfriend was just trying to be friendly and included in the family. \n\nBut the boyfriend's actions were dangerous. The author might feel that setting boundaries is necessary to protect their sister. Even though the author didn't want to interfere before, the persistent behavior (showing up uninvited, being overly familiar) might have justified the firm response. The sister's silence could be due to feeling that the author overstepped, but the author's intentions were protective.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a balance. The author had valid concerns and tried to address them directly. However, maybe there was a better way to handle it without being so confrontational. But since the boyfriend's actions were risky, the author's main goal was to protect their sister, which is a strong justification. So the answer might lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
