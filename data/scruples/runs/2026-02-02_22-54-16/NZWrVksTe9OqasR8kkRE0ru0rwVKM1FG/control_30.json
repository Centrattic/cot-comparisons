My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has concerns about his behavior\u2014drunk driving, hanging out with a known ex-felon, potential drug use. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. So the author confronted him directly, saying he's not family, just the guy dating their sister.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is concerned about their sister's safety and well-being, which is valid. The boyfriend's actions are risky, and the author is trying to protect their sister. The confrontation was direct, which might come off as harsh, but the intention is clear. \n\nThe key points to consider: Did the author overstep? The author is a family member concerned about their sister's safety. The boyfriend's behavior is questionable, and the author is setting boundaries. The author hasn't interfered before, just now addressing the boundary issue when the boyfriend was encroaching on family terms. \n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe they should have talked to their sister first instead of the boyfriend directly. Or that they were rude by calling him out in that way. However, the author's actions were to set a boundary and clarify their relationship, which is understandable given the context. The boyfriend's actions might be testing those boundaries, so the author's response is a clear statement of where they stand.\n\nThe sister's reaction is unknown, but the author's main goal was to protect their sister and define the relationship boundaries. Since the boyfriend was being overly familiar, the author's response was a way to correct that. The author isn't in a position to control the sister's dating choices, but they can manage their own interactions.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their sister and setting personal boundaries. They might have handled it differently, but the action itself was justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
