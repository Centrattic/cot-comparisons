My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister has been dating someone for under three months. The author doesn't like the boyfriend because he's made dangerous choices\u2014like drunk driving and involving her with a dangerous ex-felon. The author is keeping their opinions to themselves but is annoyed when the boyfriend starts calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then tells him he's not family, which might have upset the sister.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is concerned about their sister's safety, the boyfriend's behavior is risky, and the author is asserting boundaries. The main question is whether the author overstepped by telling the boyfriend he's not family.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as protective of their sister, but they might have intruded on their sister's relationship. On one hand, the boyfriend's actions are concerning, and the author has the right to express concerns for their sister's safety. On the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed this with their sister first rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend was getting too close and using familial terms, which the author found uncomfortable. The author might have felt that setting a boundary was necessary to prevent future issues. The sister's lack of contact after the incident suggests she might be upset, but the author's intention was to clarify boundaries.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems the author acted out of concern for their sister and to set clear boundaries. They might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their sister's well-being, even if their approach could be seen as harsh. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
