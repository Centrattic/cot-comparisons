My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's sister has a boyfriend who's been in a relationship for less than three months. The author has issues with this guy because he made dangerous decisions\u2014driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging out with an ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is concerned about his sister's safety but hasn't said anything until now because they respect her choice.\n\nNow, the boyfriend starts calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" showing up uninvited, and being overly familiar. The author finally tells him he's not family, which the boyfriend just accepts. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's right to express their feelings and the timing/way they did it. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping by being too familiar with the family. The author is trying to set boundaries to protect their sister. However, the method might have been harsh, especially since the sister is upset now.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had a valid concern about the boyfriend's behavior. But maybe they should have talked to their sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. However, since they kept their opinions to themselves until now, they might feel the need to be direct. The term \"family\" is a sensitive issue here. The author might have been justified in correcting the boyfriend's assumption, even if it came off as abrupt.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like having a conversation with their sister before confronting the boyfriend. But given the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, exposure to a dangerous ex-felon), the author's concern is valid. The confrontation might be necessary to set boundaries, even if it upset the sister.\n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author had legitimate safety concerns and was trying to protect their sister by setting boundaries. The way they handled it might have been a bit direct, but their intentions were good. The boyfriend's overfamiliarity was probably crossing a line, so the author was right to clarify their relationship.\n"
