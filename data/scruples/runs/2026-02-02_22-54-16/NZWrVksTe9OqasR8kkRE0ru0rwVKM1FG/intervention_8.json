My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author's main issue is that the boyfriend has been making unsafe decisions involving their sister, like drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The author hasn't voiced their opinions until now because they respect the sister's choice. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and using the term \"fam,\" which is where the conflict arises.\n\nThe key question is whether the author was right to tell the boyfriend he's not family. The author's actions were a response to the boyfriend's behavior. Terms like \"family\" can indeed carry a sense of closeness and trust, especially in family contexts. Using those terms might imply a level of familiarity or acceptance that the author isn't comfortable with, given the recent and potentially risky relationship. \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend is probably just trying to be friendly and integrate into the family, which is common. But on the other hand, the author is setting boundaries, especially after the boyfriend overstepped by showing up uninvited, being overly attached, and using terms that feel too intimate. The author's message wasn't about the relationship itself but about the term used. \n\nThe author might be seen as overreacting if they should have handled it more gently, but the underlying issues (drunk driving, associating with a known dangerous person) add context. The author is trying to protect their sister and set clear boundaries. The sister might feel that the author was harsh, but the author's intention was to clarify their relationship rather than attack the boyfriend's relationship with the sister. \n\nSo, considering the boyfriend's actions and the author's attempt to protect their sister, as well as the boundary regarding the use of \"family\" terms, it seems the author was justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
