My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation is that the sister's boyfriend is a young guy with a problematic history\u2014drunk driving with her in the car, associating with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and inappropriate. The author then told him he's not family, leading to the sister not talking to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's sister is in a relationship with someone who has made dangerous choices, but the author respects her choice. The issue here is the boyfriend trying to integrate into the family by using familial terms, which the author found intrusive. The author's response was direct, which might have been harsh, but it's about setting boundaries. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The boyfriend was probably trying to be friendly and build a relationship with the sister's family, which is normal. However, the author had valid concerns about the boyfriend's behavior. By calling the boyfriend out, the author might have overstepped, but it's also about protecting their sister and clarifying boundaries. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries with someone in their sister's life, especially given the boyfriend's risky behavior. On the other hand, addressing it in that way might have been abrupt and could have damaged the relationship with the sister. The author's intention was to prevent the boyfriend from thinking he's part of the family, which might not be appropriate given the short duration of the relationship and the red flags.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to express their discomfort, especially to protect their sister. However, the way they communicated it might be seen as harsh. The main issue is the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person), so the author's concern is valid. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong, because they were asserting boundaries for a legitimate reason.\n"
