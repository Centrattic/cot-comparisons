My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author is worried about the boyfriend's behavior: drunk driving with the sister in the car, hanging out with an ex-felon to buy drugs, and the guy showing up uninvited at their places. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and overstepping.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent. They wanted to set boundaries because they felt the boyfriend was being too familiar, possibly misinterpreting politeness as closeness. The author's actions were to inform the boyfriend that he's not part of the family, which is a way to establish clear boundaries. The boyfriend responded with \"alright\" and the author left. The sister hasn't responded since, but the author's main goal was to protect their sister and set limits.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as inappropriate, given the short time in the relationship and the risky behavior. The author's response was direct but not aggressive. The sister's reaction is unknown, but the author's actions aim to protect their sister. The use of the word \"family\" might have been harsh, but it's a clear boundary. The author isn't forbidding the relationship but is asserting their own limits. In such cases, setting personal boundaries is generally acceptable. The boyfriend's behavior does cross lines, so the author's reaction is justified.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
