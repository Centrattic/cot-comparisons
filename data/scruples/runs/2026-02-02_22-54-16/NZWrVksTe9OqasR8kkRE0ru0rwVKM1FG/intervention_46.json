My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the brother being concerned about the boyfriend's actions and behavior.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has some red flags: drunk driving with the sister, associating with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The brother has kept his opinions to himself until now, which shows he's tried to respect his sister's choice. But the boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the brother found annoying and inappropriate.\n\nThe brother's main point is to set a boundary, clarifying that the boyfriend isn't family. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if the brother overstepped. On one hand, the boyfriend is just trying to be friendly and integrate into the sister's family. On the other hand, the brother has valid concerns about his sister's safety and the boyfriend's judgment.\n\nThe brother's action was direct but maybe a bit harsh. He might have hurt his sister's feelings, but he's justified in protecting her. Since the sister is an adult and chose the relationship, the brother shouldn't control her choices, but he can express his concerns. The key here is whether the brother's message was necessary. By stating that the boyfriend isn't family, he's asserting boundaries without taking over the relationship. \n\nI think the brother isn't in the wrong because he's trying to protect his sister and set clear boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior was pushy, and the brother had the right to correct the situation. So the answer is B.\n"
