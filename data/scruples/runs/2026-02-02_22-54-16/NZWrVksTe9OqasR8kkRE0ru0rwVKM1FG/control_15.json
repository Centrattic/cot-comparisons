My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family,\" especially after the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The sister and the boyfriend are in a three-month relationship. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior, like drunk driving and associating with a scary ex-felon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows some restraint. However, when the boyfriend started encroaching on their personal space by showing up uninvited and being overly familiar, the author felt compelled to set a boundary. The key point here is the boyfriend's actions\u2014calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam\" might have been a way to bond, but if the author feels uncomfortable with that label, it's reasonable to address it.\n\nThe author's response was direct but not overly aggressive. They explained that the boyfriend isn't family and that they are just the sister's relative. The boyfriend just said \"alright\" and the author walked away. It's a clear message without being hostile. The author also acknowledges the boyfriend's intent to be friendly but felt a reality check was necessary.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective. The author hasn't heard from her since, which might mean she's upset. However, the author's concerns about the boyfriend's safety issues are valid. Even though the sister is allowed to choose her partner, the author has the right to express concerns about someone's behavior affecting their sister's well-being.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for setting boundaries? I don't think so. The boyfriend overstepped by trying to insert himself into the family dynamic. The author was firm but respectful. The main issue is whether the author's response was justified. Since the boyfriend's actions were inappropriate and the author communicated their discomfort clearly, the answer would be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their sister and setting personal boundaries with the boyfriend.\n"
