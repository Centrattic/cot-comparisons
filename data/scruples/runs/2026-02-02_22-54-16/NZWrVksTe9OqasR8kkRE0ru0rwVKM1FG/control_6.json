My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister has been dating a guy for under three months. The author thinks he's an idiot and has made dangerous choices, like drunk driving with the sister in the car and introducing her to a scary ex-felon to buy drugs. Despite this, the author hasn't voiced their concerns until now. The issue is that the boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"family,\" which the author found annoying. The author then told the boyfriend he's not family but just the guy the sister is dating. Now the sister hasn't talked to them since.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is concerned about the boyfriend's dangerous behavior but kept quiet until the boyfriend started trying to be too familiar. The author confronted him, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a felon) are objectively risky. The author has a right to be concerned about their sister's safety. However, the author's approach was to tell the boyfriend he's not family. Is that crossing a line?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect their sister and set boundaries. On the other hand, the author didn't address the dangerous behaviors directly but instead focused on the title of \"family,\" which might not address the root issue. The sister might feel that the author is undermining her relationship or disapproving of her choice by being confrontational with the boyfriend. The author's tone in the post suggests they understand the boyfriend is just trying to be friendly but felt it was time for a reality check. The sister's reaction (not contacting them) indicates that the author's approach might have been harsh or not well-received.\n\nThe author could have handled it differently, like discussing their concerns about the boyfriend's behavior with the sister rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. However, the author's intention was to set a boundary, which isn't inherently wrong. The question is whether the method was appropriate. Since the sister is an adult and can make her own choices, the author overstepping by being confrontational with the boyfriend might be the issue here. The author might not be in the wrong for having concerns, but their approach could be seen as inappropriate. However, the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Given that the author tried to protect their sister and set boundaries, even if the method was a bit direct, I think they are not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
