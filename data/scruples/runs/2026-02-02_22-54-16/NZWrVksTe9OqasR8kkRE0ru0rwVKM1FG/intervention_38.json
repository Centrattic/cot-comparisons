My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has issues with the guy because he made dangerous choices, like drunk driving with her and exposing her to a dangerous ex-felon. But the author kept their opinions to themselves until now.\n\nThe problem is that the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" showing up at their apartment, and being overly friendly. The author finally told him he's not family, which upset the sister. Now the sister hasn't talked to the author since.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the author's concern is valid because the boyfriend's actions are risky. They're trying to protect their sister. However, the way they addressed it was confrontational. They said he's not family, which might have been harsh, especially so soon after the relationship started. The sister might feel like the author is interfering in her personal life, even if the author has good intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior\u2014showing up uninvited, treating the author like family\u2014could be overstepping. The author had a right to set boundaries. But maybe there was a better way to handle it without being so direct and negative. The sister's reaction is understandable if she felt her partner was being disrespected or if the author came off as hostile. The key points are the author's right to protect their sister versus the sister's autonomy and the author's approach in communicating their feelings.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely wrong because they're trying to protect their sister, but the method could have been improved. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong at all. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions crossed a line. Since the author is a family member and the boyfriend was overstepping, the author had a right to set boundaries. The answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong; they're protecting their sister and setting appropriate boundaries, even if the approach was rough.\n"
