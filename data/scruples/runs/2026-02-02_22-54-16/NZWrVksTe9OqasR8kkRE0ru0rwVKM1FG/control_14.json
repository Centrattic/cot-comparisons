My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author thinks he's a bad influence\u2014drunk driving, involving her with a dangerous ex-felon to buy drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. The author then told him he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. Now the sister hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nSo, the key points here: the boyfriend's behavior is questionable, potentially dangerous. The author is concerned for their sister. They tried to stay out of it, but the boyfriend's attempts to be close felt overstepping. The author's message was direct but maybe harsh. The sister is upset, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's main concern is their sister's safety. They didn't confront the sister first, but they did address the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend's actions are risky, so the author's warning might be justified. However, the way it was delivered could be seen as abrupt. Maybe the author should have discussed it with the sister first to avoid causing a rift. On the other hand, the author has a right to set boundaries, especially if they feel the boyfriend is overstepping. The boyfriend's behavior of showing up uninvited and being overly familiar might be invasive. \n\nThe author's intention was to set a boundary, which is reasonable. The sister's reaction is a consequence, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for protecting their sister. The boyfriend's actions are concerning, so the author's message, while direct, might be necessary. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They had a valid reason to act, even if the method could be debated.\n"
