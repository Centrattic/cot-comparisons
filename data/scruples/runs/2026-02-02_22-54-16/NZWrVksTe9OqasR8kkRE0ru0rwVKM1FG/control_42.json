My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author thinks he's an idiot and has made dangerous choices, like drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The boyfriend has been showing up at the author's apartment and acting like family, even calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then confronts him, saying he's not family but the guy their sister is dating.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. They kept their opinions to themselves initially, respecting their sister's choice. But when the boyfriend started overstepping by being overly familiar and encroaching on their personal space, the author felt the need to set a boundary. \n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to say that. From a boundary perspective, it's important to set limits, especially when someone is making you uncomfortable. The boyfriend's behavior could be seen as trying to get too close, possibly without respecting the author's personal space. The author is protecting their sister by keeping the boyfriend in check, even though they disagree with her choice. \n\nHowever, the author might come off as harsh or abrupt. Telling someone they're not family could be hurtful, and there might be a better way to communicate that without being so direct. But the context is that the boyfriend was overstepping, so the author had a valid reason. \n\nAlso, the sister isn't in a good situation with the boyfriend, and the author is trying to protect her. The author's actions might have upset the sister, but it's part of being a protective sibling. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The boyfriend should have respected those. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
