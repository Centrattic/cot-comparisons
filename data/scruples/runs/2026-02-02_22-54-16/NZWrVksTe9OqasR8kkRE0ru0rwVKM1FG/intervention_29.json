My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister is dating someone for under three months. The author thinks he's making dangerous choices, like drunk driving with her and introducing her to a dangerous ex-felon. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which made the author uncomfortable.\n\nThe author then directly told the boyfriend he's not family, which the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't wrong, but they want my take. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is concerned about their sister's safety and the boyfriend's behavior. The boyfriend's actions are risky, which the author is justified in being worried about. However, the author is not the one in a relationship with the boyfriend, so their role is more as a concerned sibling.\n\nThe key issue is the author addressing the boyfriend directly. By calling him out, the author might have overstepped, especially if the sister didn't want them involved. But on the other hand, the author has a right to set boundaries, especially if the boyfriend is making them uncomfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of showing up uninvited and being overly familiar could be seen as intrusive. The author's response was direct, but was it wrong? The author's action might have been necessary to set boundaries, even if it upset the sister. However, it's possible the author should have discussed this with the sister first rather than confronting the boyfriend directly.\n\nAnother angle: the author has a responsibility to their sister's well-being, but how they approach it matters. Confronting the boyfriend without the sister's consent might not be the best approach. However, the author's intention was to protect their sister, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is B (No), it's because the author was protecting their sister and setting boundaries. If A (Yes), it's because they overstepped without involving the sister first. But the boyfriend's actions are problematic, so the author's concern is legitimate. I think B is more accurate here because the author acted on their sister's safety, even if the method could be debated. The direct confrontation might not be the best approach, but the intent isn't wrong.\n"
