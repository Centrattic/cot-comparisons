My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is about their sister's boyfriend. The author has issues with the guy because he's made dangerous choices, like drunk driving and associating with a known ex felon. But the author has kept their opinions to themselves until now.\n\nNow, the boyfriend started coming over to their apartment, being overly friendly, even calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author felt that the boyfriend was misinterpreting their politeness as friendship or family. So when the boyfriend called him \"brother,\" the author snapped and said he's not family. Then the boyfriend just said \"alright,\" and the author left. Now the sister is upset, and they haven't heard from her since.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's right to express their feelings about the boyfriend's behavior. The author's concerns are valid because the boyfriend's actions have put their sister in dangerous situations. However, the way the author communicated their feelings might have been harsh. By directly telling the boyfriend he's not family, the author might have come off as hostile, which could have upset the sister.\n\nBut wait, the author was trying to set boundaries. The boyfriend was being overly familiar, which the author found annoying. It's reasonable to want to establish where you stand, especially if the person is making you uncomfortable. The author did this in a direct way, but maybe there's a better approach. However, considering the context of the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, the author's intervention might be justified as a way to protect their sister and set limits.\n\nOn the other hand, the author should have considered the sister's feelings. The sister might feel that the author is interfering in her relationship. The author's approach could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful towards the boyfriend. But since the author had prior concerns about the boyfriend's actions, expressing those in this way might be a last straw after keeping quiet for a while.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong. They had valid reasons to be concerned about the boyfriend's behavior and the way he was interacting with their family. Setting a boundary by clarifying the relationship wasn't necessarily wrong, even if it upset the sister. However, the method could have been more tactful. But given the circumstances, the author's actions were a justified attempt to address the issue.\n"
