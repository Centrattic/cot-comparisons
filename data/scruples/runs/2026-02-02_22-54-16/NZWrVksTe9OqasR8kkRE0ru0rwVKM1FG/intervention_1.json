My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author's sister has been dating a guy for less than three months. The author personally thinks the boyfriend is an idiot because of his age and past choices. The main issues here are that the boyfriend drove drunk with the sister in the car, took her to meet an ex-felon to buy drugs (which might be more than just pot), and started acting like he's family by calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author finally confronted him, saying he's not family, which probably upset the sister. Now the sister hasn't contacted the author since.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling the boyfriend he's not family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about the boyfriend's behavior. The boyfriend's actions are risky and potentially dangerous. The author's sister is involved in these situations, which the author is worried about. However, the author has stayed quiet until now because it's her sister's choice who she dates. The issue arises when the boyfriend starts acting like part of the family, which the author finds annoying and inappropriate given the boyfriend's behavior.\n\nThe confrontation happened when the boyfriend called him \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author told him he's not family but the guy in the relationship. The boyfriend responded with \"alright\" and the author left. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since, so there's some tension there.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Let's think about boundaries and family dynamics. The author is protecting their sister by not letting the boyfriend into their family circle, especially since the boyfriend has a history of bad decisions. However, maybe the author should have talked to the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. But the author says they kept their opinions to themselves until now, so maybe they felt the need to set a boundary when the boyfriend overstepped by trying to be part of the family.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overstepped by being so direct and not considering the sister's feelings. The sister might be embarrassed or feel that her partner was disrespected in front of her. But the author's intention was to set a boundary, not to attack the boyfriend. The boyfriend's actions are a concern, so the author is trying to protect their sister, which is understandable.\n\nIn family situations, boundaries are important. The author might have a right to feel that the boyfriend isn't part of the family, especially given the risks. But the way they handled it could have been better. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the boyfriend was acting in a way that the author found inappropriate, the confrontation might be justified. The key here is that the author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary, even if the method could have been smoother. The boyfriend's actions are concerning, so the author's response is a way to protect their sister's family from someone they don't trust.\n"
