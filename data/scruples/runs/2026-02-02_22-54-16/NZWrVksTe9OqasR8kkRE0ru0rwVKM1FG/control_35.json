My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves a sister who's dating someone for under three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving with her sister, exposing her to a known ex-felon to buy drugs, etc. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. The author then told him he's not family, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is the boyfriend's behavior being risky and unsafe. They've kept their opinions to themselves until now, respecting their sister's choice. The boyfriend's actions of showing up uninvited, being overly familiar, and using familial terms might be seen as overstepping. The author's response was direct but maybe abrupt. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author has the right to set personal boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior could be seen as encroaching on space that the author isn't comfortable with. However, the method of communication might be harsh. The author didn't engage in a dialogue but rather made a direct statement, which might have come across as dismissive or disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was trying to be friendly and integrate into the sister's family. The author's sister might feel that her partner is being unfairly targeted. The author's actions might have hurt the sister's feelings, leading to her not contacting them anymore. \n\nBut considering the boyfriend's questionable actions (drunk driving, exposing sister to a dangerous ex-felon), the author is justified in being concerned. The author isn't wrong for having a boundary about not being considered family, especially given the short duration of the relationship and the risks involved. The way it was communicated could be improved, but the stance itself isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're setting personal boundaries based on valid concerns. However, the approach could have been more diplomatic to avoid hurting their sister's feelings.\n"
