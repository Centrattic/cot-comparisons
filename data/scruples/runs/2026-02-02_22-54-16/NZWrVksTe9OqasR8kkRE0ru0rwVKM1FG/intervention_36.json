My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend has been in a relationship for under three months. He's young and made some risky decisions, like drunk driving with her in the car and hanging out with a known ex-felon. The author is concerned for their sister's safety but has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and inappropriate. The author then told the boyfriend he's not family, leading to a possible rift with the sister.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's intentions. They were trying to set boundaries because they felt the boyfriend was overstepping by trying to be part of the family. The author's actions were based on concern for their sister's safety and discomfort with the boyfriend's behavior. However, the author might have overstepped by being direct in that way, especially since the boyfriend might just be trying to be friendly, albeit inappropriately.\n\nBut considering the boyfriend's actions\u2014drunk driving and associating with a dangerous person\u2014the author's concern is valid. The author's statement was a way to establish that they don't consider the boyfriend part of the family, which might be necessary given the circumstances. The sister's reaction is also important; the author might have hurt her feelings, but the main issue is the boyfriend's behavior.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did confront the boyfriend directly, which might be seen as harsh. However, the underlying reasons (sister's safety and boundaries) are legitimate. The author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their sister and setting clear boundaries, even if the delivery could have been better. So the answer should be B.\n"
