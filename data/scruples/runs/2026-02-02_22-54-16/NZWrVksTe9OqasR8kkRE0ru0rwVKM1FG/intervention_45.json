My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling his sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation is that the sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the guy's behavior\u2014drunk driving with her sister, associating with a dangerous ex-felon, and buying drugs. The author kept his opinions to himself until the boyfriend started calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" and showing up uninvited. Then he told the guy he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is acting out of concern for his sister's safety. The boyfriend's actions are risky and potentially harmful. The author didn't confront him about the dangerous behavior but about the familiarity and the title of \"family.\" The sister's choice to date him is her right, but the author has the right to set boundaries with his sister's partner. The boyfriend might have overstepped by trying to integrate into the family, which the author found uncomfortable. \n\nThe question is whether the author's response was wrong. The author was polite until the boyfriend's behavior crossed a line. By calling him out on the \"family\" thing, he was clarifying boundaries, not attacking the relationship directly. However, some might argue that the author should have addressed the dangerous behavior first. But the user's sister made the choice to date him, so the author's role is more about protecting his own family and setting personal boundaries rather than interfering in the relationship.\n\nIt's possible the author's sister is upset because he criticized her partner, but the author's primary responsibility is to his own family's well-being. The boyfriend's actions are concerning, so the author's response was a way to assert that he doesn't accept the boyfriend as part of his family circle. The line \"You\u2019re not my family\" was a clear boundary, which is valid. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
