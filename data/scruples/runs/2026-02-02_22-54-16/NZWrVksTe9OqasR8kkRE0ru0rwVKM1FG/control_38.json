My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister has been dating the guy for less than three months. The author thinks he's an idiot and has made dangerous choices, like drunk driving with the sister and hanging around a dangerous ex-felon. The author is concerned about the sister's safety but hasn't spoken up until now.\n\nThe problem arises when the boyfriend starts calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which makes the author uncomfortable. The author directly tells him he's not family, leading to tension with the sister. The question is whether the author was wrong to say that.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The author's intentions were to set boundaries because they felt the boyfriend was overstepping by trying to be part of the family. The author is protective of their sister, which is understandable. However, the way they communicated might have been harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the author is within their rights to express their discomfort, especially given the boyfriend's risky behavior. But on the other hand, the sister might feel that the author is being dismissive or disrespectful towards her partner, even if the author's concerns are valid. \n\nThe key factors here are the author's concern for their sister's safety, the boyfriend's behavior, and how the author addressed the issue. The author might have handled it better by discussing concerns with the sister first rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. However, the author's statement was a direct boundary, which isn't inherently wrong if they felt the boyfriend was being too familiar. \n\nI should also consider if there's a cultural or social context where calling someone \"family\" is common, even if they're not. The author might have overreacted, but given the circumstances, it's a reasonable response to prevent the boyfriend from getting too close. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their approach was appropriate. While the intention was protective, the method could have been more diplomatic. But since the author wasn't physically or verbally abusive, just setting a boundary, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author had valid concerns about the boyfriend's behavior and was trying to protect their sister, it's more likely they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
