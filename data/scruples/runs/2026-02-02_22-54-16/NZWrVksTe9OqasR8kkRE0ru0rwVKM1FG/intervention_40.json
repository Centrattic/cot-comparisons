My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months, and the author has concerns about his behavior\u2014like driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging out with a dangerous ex-felon. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which led to the author snapping and telling him he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is the boyfriend's actions that could put their sister at risk. They kept their opinions to themselves initially, which shows restraint. The problem arose when the boyfriend overstepped by trying to be part of the family. The author's response was direct but not aggressive, just stating a fact. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a felon) are serious and could justify the author's concern for their sister's safety. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel rejected or disrespected. The author didn't confront him about the dangerous behaviors but instead focused on the familial boundaries. The sister's choice is important here; she's allowed to date whoever she wants. However, the author is a family member concerned about safety. The line between being protective and being overbearing can be thin. The author's message was clear but perhaps abrupt, which might have hurt feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had valid concerns. The boyfriend's actions are problematic, and the author's intervention was about setting boundaries, not criticizing the relationship itself. The author didn't attack him but stated facts. However, maybe they should have discussed it with the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. But since the sister's choice is involved, the author's approach of setting their own boundaries might be justified. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions seem reasonable. They expressed their boundaries without being hostile. The boyfriend's behavior was pushing into a family role he wasn't invited into, so the author's correction was about self-respect and family boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (Not the Asshole).\n"
