My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's sister has been dating a guy for under three months. The author has concerns about this guy's behavior\u2014he drove drunk with her sister, hung out with an ex felon, and they suspect he's involved in drug sales. The author hasn't voiced these directly before, but now the boyfriend is acting like part of the family, calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author finally tells him he's not family, which led to a cold response from the sister.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions: they want to protect their sister. The boyfriend's actions are dangerous, so the author is concerned. But they've kept their opinions to themselves until now, respecting their sister's choice to date him. The issue here is the boyfriend's behavior toward the author, trying to be too close. The author's message is clear that they don't want the boyfriend to feel like family, which might be necessary to maintain boundaries.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend might not realize that his actions are making the author uncomfortable. He's trying to integrate into the family, which is common for new partners. However, the author's sister is the one who chooses her partner, and the author's role is to support her while setting their own boundaries. The key point is whether the author overstepped by directly confronting the boyfriend. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to set personal boundaries. On the other hand, maybe they should have discussed this with their sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly, which could have caused the sister to feel disrespected. However, the author's actions were to clarify their relationship without attacking the boyfriend personally. Also, the boyfriend's behavior\u2014showing up unannounced and being overly familiar\u2014could justify the author's need to set limits.\n\nThe sister's reaction is important too. If she's upset, maybe the author didn't consider her perspective. But the author's concern for her safety is valid. The question is whether the method was appropriate. Since the author addressed the behavior (the familiarity) rather than the boyfriend's character, it might be justified. So, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They set a boundary to protect themselves and possibly their sister, even if it caused tension.\n"
