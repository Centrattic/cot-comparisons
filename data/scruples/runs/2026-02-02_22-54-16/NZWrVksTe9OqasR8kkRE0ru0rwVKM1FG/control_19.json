My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author talking to their sister's boyfriend about not considering him family. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's sister is dating someone for under three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving with her sister, associating with a known ex-felon, and potential drug use. The author hasn't voiced these concerns before, keeping to themselves, but now the boyfriend is being overly familiar, calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" and showing up uninvited.\n\nThe key points are the author's intentions and actions. They wanted to set boundaries because they felt the boyfriend was overstepping by trying to be part of the family. The author's message was direct: \"You\u2019re not my family. You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\" The boyfriend responded with \"alright\" and they walked away. The author is worried about upsetting the sister and causing a rift.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The author had valid safety concerns about the boyfriend's actions, which could affect their sister. However, the way they addressed it was confrontational. While it's reasonable to set boundaries, the manner in which they did it might have come off as harsh or dismissive. The author didn't confront the sister first but went straight to the boyfriend, which might have bypassed the sister's input. The sister might feel her choice to date him is being undermined, especially if the author didn't discuss their concerns with her first. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of wanting to be included in the family is common in new relationships, but the author's reaction might have been too abrupt. A better approach could have been to talk to the sister privately about the concerns and let her decide how to address the boyfriend's behavior. By directly confronting the boyfriend without involving the sister, the author might have overstepped, leading to the sister's silence.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had legitimate safety concerns and wanted to set boundaries. However, their method could have been more considerate and collaborative with the sister. The main issue is that the author didn't go through the sister first, which is a key relationship step. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's room to argue nuances. But according to the AITA standards, if the person acted out of concern and had valid reasons, even if the approach was a bit direct, they might not be the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
