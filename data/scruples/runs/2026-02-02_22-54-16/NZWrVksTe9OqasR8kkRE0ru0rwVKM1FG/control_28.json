My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author confronting their sister's boyfriend about calling him \"family.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior, like drunk driving with the sister and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which irritated the author, leading them to tell the boyfriend he's not family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a personal responsibility standpoint, the author did confront the boyfriend about calling him family, which could be seen as setting a boundary. The author might feel protective of their sister given the boyfriend's risky behavior. However, the sister is an adult and has the right to choose her partner. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the sister might take it as interference. But considering the potential harm the boyfriend could cause, the author's concerns are valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach was direct and might have come off as harsh. The sister might feel that the author is not respecting her choice by being so confrontational. The boyfriend's actions, while concerning, are the sister's decision to manage. However, the boyfriend's behavior towards the author (attaching himself, using familial terms) could be seen as overreaching, which the author rightly addressed.\n\nBalancing these factors, the author isn't necessarily wrong in setting boundaries to protect their sister and themselves. The sister's autonomy is important, but so is ensuring her partner isn't being overly familiar with the family in a way that discomforts them. The key here is that the author didn't try to prevent the relationship outright but instead addressed a specific boundary issue. So, the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
