My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for telling his sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend has been in the relationship for under three months. The author doesn't like him because he made dangerous choices\u2014like driving drunk with her sister in the car and getting her around an ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is worried about his sister's safety but hasn't said much until now. The boyfriend has been showing up uninvited, being overly friendly, using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found irritating. The author then told him directly that he's not family, which led to the sister not talking to him since.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped. On one hand, the boyfriend's actions are concerning. The author is trying to protect his sister and set boundaries. But on the other hand, the author is not the one in the relationship; the sister is the one dating him. The author might have a right to be concerned about safety, but how they handled it could be an issue. Telling someone they're not family might come off as harsh, especially if the sister hasn't addressed those concerns. The author didn't confront the boyfriend about the dangerous behavior but instead focused on the familial label. Maybe they should have approached the sister first to express their worries instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. The sister's reaction (not talking to the author) suggests that the approach might have been too direct without considering her feelings or perspective. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend might have just been trying to be friendly, as the author acknowledges. The line between being protective and being overbearing can be thin here. The author's actions could be seen as infringing on the sister's autonomy in her relationship. While the intentions were to protect, the method might be what's causing the issue. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't go through the sister first and directly confronted the boyfriend, which might have been the wrong approach.\n"
