My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person told their sister's boyfriend he's not family after the boyfriend was acting too familiar.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the guy's behavior\u2014he's young, made dangerous choices like drunk driving with the sister in the car, and took her to meet an ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is worried about the guy's influence on their sister. \n\nThe boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" and showed up uninvited at their apartment and at their mom's house. The author finally told him he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. The sister hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but is seeking validation. The options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong). \n\nNow, considering the key points. The author has valid safety concerns about the boyfriend's actions. The boyfriend's behavior intrudes on personal space and uses family terms inappropriately. The author's response was direct but not confrontational\u2014just stating the facts. The sister might be upset because her boyfriend was reprimanded, but the author's main goal was to set boundaries for their own comfort and safety. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The boyfriend's actions were inappropriate in the author's eyes, and the author had the right to set boundaries. However, the sister's choice in partners is her own, and the author might have overstepped by directly confronting the boyfriend. But given the dangerous behavior, the author's concern is justified. The response was a boundary-setting action, which is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B\u2014no, the author is not in the wrong. They were protecting their sister's well-being and their own boundaries.\n"
