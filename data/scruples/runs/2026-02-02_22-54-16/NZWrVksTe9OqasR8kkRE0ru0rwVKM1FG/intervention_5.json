My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the guy's behavior: drunk driving with the sister in the car, associating with a known ex-felon to buy drugs, and making dangerous choices. The author has stayed quiet until now because it's the sister's choice who she dates. However, the boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and overstepping. The author then told him directly he's not family, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nSo, the key points are the author's concerns about the boyfriend's behavior, the boyfriend's attempts to be close, and the author's response. The author's intention was to set boundaries, not to be hostile, but to correct the boyfriend's mistaken perception of their relationship. The author is protecting their sister's well-being and family dynamics. \n\nThe boyfriend might have felt that being included in the family was a good sign, but the author is asserting that the relationship is only with the sister. The author's actions were direct but not necessarily cruel. They didn't attack the boyfriend personally but addressed the boundary issue. The sister's reaction is also a factor, but the author's main concern was the boyfriend's behavior and the false family label. \n\nI think the author is in the right because they're protecting their sister's safety and family boundaries. The boyfriend overstepped by assuming a familial role, and the author had the right to correct that. The author's approach was direct but not malicious. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
