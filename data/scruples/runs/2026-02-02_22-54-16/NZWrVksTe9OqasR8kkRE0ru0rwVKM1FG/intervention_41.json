My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister is dating someone for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving with the sister, associating with a known ex-felon for drugs. The author keeps their opinions to themselves initially, which shows they respect the sister's autonomy in dating. \n\nThen, the boyfriend starts showing up uninvited at the author's place, hugging the author's hip when they visit their mom, and using familial terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author feels this is overstepping boundaries, so they confront him by stating he's not family. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since, implying tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. From a boundary perspective, the author is asserting their discomfort with the boyfriend's behavior. The boyfriend's actions are perceived as intrusive and the author's response is a way to set limits. The author isn't attacking the boyfriend's relationship but clarifying their own boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author could have approached it differently, maybe discussing their concerns with their sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. But the main issue is the boyfriend's over-familiarity and the author's right to set personal boundaries. The dangerous behavior of the boyfriend adds weight to the author's concern for their sister's safety, but the question is about the confrontation itself.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for family to have strained relationships with a partner's significant other, especially if there are concerns. The author's directness might have been harsh, but the intent was to establish boundaries. The response \"You're not my family\" is a clear but necessary statement to prevent further encroachment. The sister's reaction is unfortunate, but it's possible she's upset because the confrontation was direct, not because the author was wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries, even if it caused conflict. The key is that the author was protecting their own space and possibly their sister's well-being by addressing the boyfriend's behavior.\n"
