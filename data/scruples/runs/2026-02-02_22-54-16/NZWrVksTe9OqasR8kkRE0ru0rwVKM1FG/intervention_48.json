My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has issues with the guy's behavior\u2014drunk driving with her sister, associating with a dangerous ex-felon to get drugs. The author is worried about his sister's safety but hasn't said much before because it's her choice who she dates. However, the boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. So the author told him he's not family, just the guy she's dating now. The sister hasn't talked to the author since.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about the boyfriend's dangerous behavior. They have a right to worry about their sister's well-being. Also, the boyfriend's actions\u2014showing up uninvited, being overly familiar\u2014might cross boundaries. The author was polite until now but felt the need to set a boundary when the boyfriend overstepped by using family terms. It's possible that the author was trying to protect their sister and set a clear line about their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have addressed the safety concerns first before the family comment. The sister might feel that her partner is being judged, especially if the author didn't approach her directly about the risky behaviors. Yelling at the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister first could have caused tension. Also, calling someone out in front of others or in a direct manner might be harsh, leading to the sister being upset.\n\nBut the key part is the statement \"You\u2019re not my family.\" The author did this in response to the boyfriend's attempts to be close. The author's intention was to correct the perception that they were part of the family, which could be reasonable if the boyfriend was overstepping. It's about setting personal boundaries. However, the method might have been abrupt. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been better, like talking to the sister first, but the action itself might not be wrong.\n\nConsidering all factors: The author's concern for their sister's safety is valid. The way they addressed the boyfriend's behavior could be seen as overstepping, but given the context, it's a boundary issue. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they were protecting their sister and setting personal boundaries. However, the approach could have been more diplomatic. But based on the user's question, they want a yes or no.\n\nI think the author did the right thing in setting that boundary, even if it caused temporary conflict. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
