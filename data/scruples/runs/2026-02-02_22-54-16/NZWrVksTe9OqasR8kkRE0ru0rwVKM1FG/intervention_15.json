My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has concerns about his behavior: driving drunk with her in the car, associating with a known ex-felon to buy pot, and the guy being very young. They mentioned keeping their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" and even showed up uninvited at their apartment. \n\nThe author's main issue is that the boyfriend is trying to become part of the family, which the author is uncomfortable with. They told him directly that he's not family, just the guy my sister is dating. The boyfriend responded with \"alright\" and the author left. Now the sister hasn't talked to them since, which the author acknowledges might have upset her.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author is concerned about their sister's safety and well-being, given the boyfriend's risky actions. However, they also recognize that the sister's choice in partners is her own decision. The author's statement was direct, but was it crossing a line? \n\nCalling someone \"family\" can be a way to show acceptance, but the author clearly states it's not appropriate. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The author's response was to correct the assumption, which might be necessary if the boyfriend is indeed being too familiar too soon. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author had the right to make that statement. The sister's boyfriend is not a direct threat to the author, but the author is worried about their sister. However, the author is not the one in the relationship, so maybe they should have approached it differently, perhaps talking to their sister first about their concerns instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. \n\nThe boyfriend might feel that the author is being hostile or not respecting the relationship. Even if the author's intentions are good, the way they addressed it could have been more tactful. The sister might feel that her partner is being criticized by her sibling, leading to tension. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to feel uncomfortable with the boyfriend's intrusiveness and false claims about being family. The statement was a boundary set, which is important for personal relationships. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's approach was appropriate. While the concerns are valid, confronting the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first might not be the best method. However, the act of setting a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. The author's intention was to clarify their stance, but it could have been handled more carefully. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), but with the consideration that the approach might need refinement. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the main action was setting a boundary, the author isn't wrong, but maybe could have done it differently.\n"
