My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014driving drunk with her sister, associating with a dangerous ex-felon to buy drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. The author then told him he's not family.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions are concerning. Even though it's the sister's choice to date him, the author is worried about her safety. The boyfriend's attempt to be friendly by using family terms might have crossed a line from the author's perspective. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe confronting the sister first instead of the boyfriend directly. But in this case, the author felt the need to set boundaries because the boyfriend was being too familiar. \n\nThe key here is the boyfriend's behavior and the author's response. The author's intention was to clarify the relationship boundaries, which isn't inherently wrong. But maybe the approach was harsh, leading to tension with the sister. \n\nConsidering the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person), the author's concerns are valid. Telling him he's not family could be seen as protecting their sister, even if it upset her. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author had legitimate concerns and was setting boundaries to protect their sister, even if the method was abrupt. The boyfriend's behavior was problematic, and the author's response was a way to address it.\n"
