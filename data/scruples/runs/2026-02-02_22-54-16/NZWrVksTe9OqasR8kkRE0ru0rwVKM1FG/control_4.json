My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister is dating someone for less than three months. The writer has concerns about the guy's behavior\u2014drunk driving with the sister, associating with a dangerous ex-felon, and engaging in illegal activities. The writer has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the writer \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the writer found annoying and wanted to address. The writer then told him directly that he isn't family, just the guy the sister is dating. The boyfriend responded with \"alright\" and the writer walked away. Now, the sister hasn't contacted them, possibly upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points here. The writer's main motivation is concern for their sister's safety and well-being, given the dangerous situations the boyfriend has involved her in. The writer has a right to express their concerns, especially if they believe the boyfriend is a threat. However, the way they addressed it\u2014publicly calling the boyfriend out and asserting a lack of familial relationship\u2014might be seen as harsh or confrontational.\n\nOn one hand, the writer is protecting their sister and standing up for their boundaries. It's understandable to want to prevent someone from becoming too close with family if there are risks involved. The writer's actions could be seen as necessary to maintain healthy boundaries and ensure their sister's safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the approach might have been abrupt. Instead of confronting the boyfriend directly, the writer might have considered talking to their sister first, explaining their concerns, and letting her make an informed decision. By addressing the boyfriend directly without prior discussion with the sister, the writer might have overstepped, especially since the sister's choice of partner is her own decision. The way the message was delivered could have been perceived as dismissive or disrespectful, leading to the sister's anger and silence.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's intentions were likely to build a relationship with the sister's family, which is a common and usually harmless action. The writer's response might have been too harsh, given that the boyfriend wasn't necessarily encroaching in a malicious way. The writer's frustration is valid due to the dangerous behaviors, but the method of addressing it might not have been the most constructive.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the writer isn't necessarily wrong because they're acting out of concern for their sister. However, the manner and timing of their intervention could be questioned. It's a judgment call between protecting family and respecting the relationship dynamics. The key factors here are intent and the approach taken. The intent was protective, but the approach might have been too direct without considering the potential fallout with the sister.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the writer is not entirely in the wrong (since they have valid concerns), but their method could have been improved. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. In such cases, people often debate both sides. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the core issue is protecting family and setting boundaries. However, some might argue A (wrong) because of the direct confrontation without consulting the sister first. But given the dangerous behaviors, the writer's actions are more about safety, which justifies their stance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
