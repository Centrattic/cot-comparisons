My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The key points here are the sister's boyfriend's behavior and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has dangerous habits: he drove drunk with the sister in the car and exposed her to a known ex-felon. The author is concerned about their sister's safety, which is valid. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, which shows they didn't act out without reason.\n\nThe boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which made the author uncomfortable. The author felt the need to set a boundary by stating that the boyfriend isn't family. The author's main goal was to correct the boyfriend's assumption of closeness and to protect their sister's family from someone they view as a bad influence.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's actions, the author's intervention was a way to ensure that the boyfriend understands the boundaries of his role in the family. While it might have upset the sister, the author's intention was to protect their sister from potential harm. The author didn't confront him out of spite but out of concern for their sister's well-being.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could have approached the situation differently. Instead of directly confronting the boyfriend, they might have tried talking to their sister first about their concerns. However, given the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, the author might have felt that a direct approach was necessary for immediate boundary-setting. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions are the root issue here. If the author's sister is in a relationship with someone who puts her at risk, the author has a right to be concerned. The author's response was a firm but necessary boundary to prevent the boyfriend from becoming too comfortable around the family, which could potentially enable his harmful behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method of confrontation might not be the most tactful, the author's intentions were rooted in protecting their sister. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
