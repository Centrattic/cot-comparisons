My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author doesn't like him because of his age and some dangerous actions\u2014drunk driving with her in the truck and exposing her to a dangerous ex-felon. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited, being overly attached, and calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" Then the author directly told him he's not family, leading to a fallout with the sister.\n\nSo, is the author right or wrong? Well, the key points here are the author's concern for their sister's safety and the way they communicated it. The boyfriend's actions were risky, so the author has valid reasons to be worried. However, the method of addressing it was pretty direct and maybe a bit harsh. The author didn't confront the sister first, which might be important because the sister is the one in the relationship. Telling the boyfriend he's not family could come off as dismissive or cutting off communication, which might not be the best approach even if the author's intentions are good.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that their sister's boyfriend was overstepping boundaries by trying to integrate too quickly into the family. The boyfriend's behavior of showing up uninvited and being overly attached could be concerning. The author's statement was a clear boundary, which some might argue is necessary to prevent the boyfriend from feeling more accepted than he should, especially given his actions.\n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't involve their sister in this conversation. It's her choice who she dates, and the author's approach might have bypassed her, causing her to feel disrespected or unheard. The sister might have wanted to handle the situation herself, or at least be part of the discussion. By directly confronting the boyfriend, the author might have acted without considering their sister's perspective, leading to her being upset.\n\nAdditionally, calling someone \"not family\" can be hurtful and might not be the most effective way to communicate concerns. It could make the boyfriend feel alienated and might not address the underlying issues. The author's intention was to set a boundary, but the method might have been too abrupt or confrontational, especially for someone who's not even family yet.\n\nSo, weighing the safety concerns against the method of communication and the lack of involving the sister, the author might not be in the wrong for expressing their concerns, but perhaps the way they did it could have been handled more sensitively. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's actions were indeed problematic, the author's concern is justified. But the direct approach and not going through the sister first could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe answer probably hinges on whether the author had the right to address the boyfriend directly without consulting their sister. If the author's role is to protect their sister, they should have talked to her first. By doing so, they might have supported their sister in setting boundaries rather than imposing their own. Therefore, the author's actions could be considered inconsiderate of their sister's autonomy and possibly the wrong approach, even if their intentions were good.\n"
