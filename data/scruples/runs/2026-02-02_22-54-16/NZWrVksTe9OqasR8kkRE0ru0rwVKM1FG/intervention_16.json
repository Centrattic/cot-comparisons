My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's sister has been dating someone for under three months. The author has concerns about the guy's behavior\u2014he drove drunk with her sister, got her involved with a dangerous ex-felon, and is generally considered a bad influence. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited, acting overly familiar, and calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author finally told him he's not family, which upset the sister, who hasn't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main issue is the boyfriend's actions that put the sister at risk, which are serious. The author is within their right to be concerned about their sister's safety. By keeping their opinions to themselves initially, they respected her autonomy in choosing her partner. However, the boyfriend's behavior crossed a line by intruding into the author's personal space and assuming a familial role without being invited. The author's response was direct but firm, which might have been necessary to set boundaries.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's actions are problematic, and the author has the right to express concerns about their sister's safety. However, the way the author addressed the issue might have been abrupt. Instead of a direct confrontation, maybe a more diplomatic approach could have been better, especially considering family dynamics. However, the author's intention was to protect their sister and set personal boundaries, which is valid. The sister's reaction is unfortunate, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for standing up for her and themselves.\n\nAnother angle: The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, exposing her sister to danger) are red flags. The author's concern is justified. The boyfriend overstepped by trying to integrate into the family without being invited, which the author rightly pointed out. The author's statement, while blunt, was a clear boundary. The sister might feel that the author is interfering, but the author's actions were protective. \n\nPotential counterarguments: The author didn't discuss their concerns with the sister first, directly confronting the boyfriend instead. That might have been a better approach. However, the author might not want to escalate tensions or cause the sister to feel judged. The situation is tricky because it involves a close family member's choice. \n\nIn summary, the author's intentions were protective and boundary-setting, which are understandable. The method might have been harsh, but the underlying reasons are valid. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
