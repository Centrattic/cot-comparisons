My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author has some issues with him because he made dangerous choices, like driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is worried about the sister's safety but has kept to themselves until now.\n\nThe brother-in-law (the author) feels that the boyfriend was overstepping by coming to his apartment, attaching himself when he visits their mom, and using familial terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The breaking point was when the author told him he isn't family, which probably upset the sister.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's concerns about the boyfriend's safety and the boyfriend's behavior of trying to be part of the family. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is understandable, but might have come off as harsh. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they have a right to be concerned about their sister's well-being. However, telling someone they're not family might be seen as dismissive or rude. The author didn't attack the boyfriend's character directly but set a boundary. It's possible that the approach was a bit abrupt, but given the circumstances, it's a justified reaction to prevent the boyfriend from feeling too included in the family when the author isn't comfortable.\n\nAlso, considering the sister's choice in dating is her own right, but the author is protecting their family. The boyfriend's actions were risky, so the author's intervention could be seen as protective. However, the method of communication might have been a problem. The author didn't confront the sister first or talk to the boyfriend privately in a different way. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author had valid concerns and tried to address the overfamiliar behavior, even if it was direct, they might not be wrong. On the other hand, the way they communicated it could have been handled more delicately to avoid hurting the sister's feelings. However, the answer hinges on whether the action was unjustified. The author's actions were in response to the boyfriend's overstepping, so B (not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
