My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the sister dating someone for less than three months. The author has issues with the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving, being around a dangerous ex-felon, etc. They kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. So they told him he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main concern is their sister's safety because of the boyfriend's actions. They\u2019ve tried to stay out of the relationship but felt compelled to act when the boyfriend overstepped by trying to be part of the family. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the boyfriend might have been just being friendly, trying to bond with the family as someone often does in relationships. The author's response could come off as abrupt or harsh, especially if the sister was upset. But on the other hand, the author had valid concerns about the boyfriend's behavior. They might have felt that the boyfriend wasn't respecting boundaries by being too familiar. \n\nAlso, the author made it clear that it's the sister's choice who she dates, which shows they're respecting her autonomy. The confrontation was direct but maybe necessary to set a boundary. The sister not speaking to the author after that could be a result of the tension, but that's more about how the sister reacted rather than the author being wrong. \n\nI think the key points are the author's concern for their sister's safety and the need to establish boundaries. While the method of confrontation might not have been the most diplomatic, the intention was to protect the sister and clarify the relationship. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
