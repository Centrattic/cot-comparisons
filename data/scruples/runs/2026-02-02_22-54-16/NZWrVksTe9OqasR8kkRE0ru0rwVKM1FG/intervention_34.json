My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author thinks he's an idiot and has made dangerous choices\u2014like driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging out with a known ex-felon. The author is concerned about the sister's safety.\n\nThe boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. The author then told him he's not family but just the guy the sister is dating. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since, and the author is wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is trying to protect their sister from a potentially harmful relationship. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person) are serious red flags. The author kept their opinions to themselves initially, which shows they tried to respect their sister's choice. But when the boyfriend overstepped by showing up uninvited and trying to be overly familiar, the author felt the need to set a boundary.\n\nIs it wrong to set a boundary? Well, the author isn't in a position to dictate who the sister dates, but they have the right to express concerns and set personal limits. The author's statement was direct but not aggressive. They didn't attack the boyfriend personally but clarified their relationship status. The boyfriend responded calmly, so maybe the message was received.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have discussed this with the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. However, the sister might not want to hear her family's disapproval, especially if she's in denial about the boyfriend's behavior. The author might have acted to protect the sister without her consent, which could be seen as overstepping. But given the safety concerns, it's a tough call.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, it's common for siblings to have different levels of closeness with each other's partners. The author's firm stance might have been necessary to prevent further encroachment on their personal space. The sister's silence could be due to feeling that her family is undermining her relationship, which is a valid concern on her part.\n\nOverall, the author's intentions were protective. The method of confronting the boyfriend might have been harsh, but the underlying concern for the sister's safety is valid. The sister's reaction is her prerogative, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
