My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong after telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's sister has been dating someone for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving with the sister, hanging out with a dangerous ex-felon, and buying drugs. The boyfriend has been trying to get close to the author's family, even calling him \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then tells the boyfriend he's not family, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nNow, considering the rightness or wrongness here. The author is protecting their sister and family. The boyfriend's actions are risky, so the author has valid concerns. However, the sister's choice to date him is her decision, and the author stepping in might overstep. But the boyfriend's behavior towards them (like showing up uninvited, being overly familiar) is inappropriate. The author's response was direct but maybe a bit harsh. The question is whether the author was wrong to say that.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's justification based on the boyfriend's actions, the sister's autonomy, and the appropriateness of the author's approach. The author's intention was to set boundaries, which is understandable given the risks. However, maybe there was a better way to handle it without causing a rift. But the main issue is the boyfriend's behavior. The author isn't wrong for trying to protect their family from someone who's a bad influence. So the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
