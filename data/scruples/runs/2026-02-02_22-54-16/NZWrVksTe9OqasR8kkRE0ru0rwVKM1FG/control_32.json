My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister's boyfriend has been in a relationship for under three months. The author thinks he's making dangerous choices: drunk driving with the sister in the car and associating with a scary ex-felon to buy pot. The author is concerned for their sister's safety.\n\nThe boyfriend then starts calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam\" and showing up uninvited at their apartment and their mom's place. The author feels this is overstepping and finally tells him he's not family. The sister hasn't responded since.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether the author had the right to set that boundary. The boyfriend was getting too close and making the author uncomfortable. The author's actions were to set a boundary, not to attack the boyfriend. They mentioned it's the sister's choice who she dates, so they tried to stay out of it until the boyfriend's behavior crossed a line.\n\nThe boyfriend might feel disrespected, but the author's main intent was to clarify the relationship boundaries. The sister's reaction is also a factor, but the question is about the author's actions. Since the boyfriend was acting in ways that made the author uncomfortable and the author was protecting their sister's family, it's more about setting a necessary boundary. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
