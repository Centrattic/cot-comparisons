My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend did some concerning things: they wrecked the truck while drunk, took her to meet an ex-felon to buy drugs, and there's a lot more than just pot. The author is worried about the guy's influence on their sister. But the author has been keeping their opinions to themselves until now, which seems responsible because it's the sister's choice who she dates.\n\nThen, the boyfriend starts showing up uninvited, trying to befriend the author, using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author feels that this is overstepping, especially since the relationship is only a few months old. The author confronts him by saying, \"You're not my family. You're the guy my sister is dating for now.\" The boyfriend just says \"alright\" and walks away. The sister is upset, and they haven't heard from each other since.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the author is protecting their sister's well-being and boundaries. They're not trying to control their sister's choices but are concerned about her safety. On the other hand, the author might have been abrupt in their approach, which could have been hurtful or seemed dismissive. However, considering the boyfriend's behavior and the author's valid concerns, the confrontation might be justified. The key here is that the author is respecting their sister's choice to be with the guy but is setting boundaries for their own relationship with him. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their sister and setting those boundaries, especially given the boyfriend's risky actions. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
