My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months, and the author has issues with his behavior\u2014like drunk driving with her in the car and getting her around a scary ex-felon to buy drugs. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which bugged the author, leading them to confront him directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's concerns are valid because the boyfriend's actions are dangerous and potentially harmful to their sister. The author is protecting their sister, which is a common family dynamic. However, the way they addressed it might be a point of contention. The author didn't confront the sister first but went straight to the boyfriend. That could be seen as bypassing the sister, which might make the sister upset, as mentioned in the story.\n\nThe key points here: the author's intentions are protective, but the method of communication might be abrupt. The boyfriend was trying to be friendly and bond with the family, but the author felt it was overstepping. The line \"You\u2019re not my family. You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\" is pretty direct and might come off as harsh, especially since the boyfriend might have been trying to integrate into the family.\n\nHowever, the author's personal feelings (thinking the guy is an idiot) might cloud their judgment. They admit the boyfriend is young and made mistakes in the past, so maybe they're being judgmental. But the actual dangerous behaviors are real concerns. The author did keep their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend's behavior crossed a line by showing up uninvited and being overly familiar.\n\nThe sister's reaction is unclear, but the fact that she hasn't responded might mean she's upset with the author for confronting the boyfriend directly. In family dynamics, it's usually better to discuss such concerns with the sister first rather than the boyfriend. However, the author might feel that the sister isn't taking the warnings seriously, given that the relationship is relatively new and the boyfriend's actions are risky.\n\nSo, balancing the intent to protect the sister against the method of confrontation. The author's message was clear but could be perceived as dismissive or rude. On the other hand, the boyfriend's actions do warrant concern. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their concerns, but the approach might have been better handled by first talking to the sister. Since the story ends with the sister not responding, maybe the author should have considered that approach. But given the urgency of the situation and the potential danger, the author's actions are justifiable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
