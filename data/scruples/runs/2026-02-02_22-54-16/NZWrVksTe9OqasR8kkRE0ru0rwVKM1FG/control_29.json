My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister is dating a guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving with his girlfriend, associating with a known ex-felon for drugs, and being generally irresponsible. Despite that, the author hasn't voiced their opinions until now. The issue arises when the boyfriend starts calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" and the author confronts him, saying he's not family. The sister is now upset, and they haven't heard from her since.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the boyfriend's actions are concerning. The author's main goal is to protect their sister, which is understandable. The boyfriend's attempts to befriend the author might be seen as appropriate for someone trying to integrate into the family. However, the author's approach was direct and confrontational, which might have hurt the sister's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt that the boyfriend was overstepping by using familial terms. The author had kept their concerns private until this point, which shows some restraint. But when the boyfriend started acting like part of the family, the author felt the need to set boundaries. \n\nConsidering that the sister is the one who's dating the boyfriend, she has the right to choose who she's with. The author's intervention, while well-intentioned, might have been a breach of her autonomy. However, the author's concern for their sister's safety is valid. The key here is the method used to address the situation. The confrontation was direct, which could be seen as harsh, especially if the author didn't discuss their concerns with the sister first.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the way they did it might have been abrupt. The bigger issue is whether the author should have talked to their sister first before confronting the boyfriend. If they had discussed their concerns with her, maybe the boyfriend could have been addressed more collaboratively. By confronting him directly, the author bypassed the sister, which could explain why she's upset. \n\nSo, factors to consider: the boyfriend's behavior is risky, the author's intentions are protective, but the approach was confrontational without discussing with the sister. The sister's perspective is crucial here because she's the one in the relationship. The author might not be in the wrong for caring about their sister's safety, but the method could have been better. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were justified in the context of protecting their sister versus respecting the sister's autonomy. The author isn't in the wrong because their actions were a response to genuine concerns about their sister's safety, even if the approach was direct. However, the sister might feel disrespected if her choices are undermined. But given the boyfriend's risky behavior, the author's intervention to set boundaries is understandable.\n"
