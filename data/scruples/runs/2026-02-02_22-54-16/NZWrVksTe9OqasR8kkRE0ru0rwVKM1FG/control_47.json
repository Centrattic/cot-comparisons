My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family. The sister has been dating the guy for under three months, and the author thinks he's making bad choices, like driving drunk and hanging out with a dangerous ex-felon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned about their sister's safety and has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which made the author uncomfortable. The author then told him he's not family, leading to the sister not speaking to them since.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's concern for their sister's well-being versus the sister's right to choose her partner. The author might feel protective, but the sister is an adult and can make her own decisions. However, the boyfriend's actions are risky, which the author is pointing out.\n\nBut where's the line? The author might have overstepped by being direct like that, especially if the sister didn't ask for their input. The sister might feel that the author is interfering in her relationship. On the other hand, the author has a valid concern about the boyfriend's behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014driving drunk with the sister in the car and associating with a dangerous ex-felon\u2014are serious. The author's intention was to set a boundary, not to be hostile. The response from the sister not talking to them might indicate that the approach was too harsh or came out of nowhere.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? The key is whether the author had the right to intervene. Since the sister is an adult, the author can't control her choices. However, the author can express concern. The way the author communicated it\u2014\"You're not my family\"\u2014might have been hurtful or dismissive, making it seem like a personal attack instead of a concern for safety.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend was trying to build a relationship with the family, which is common. The author's reaction could be seen as rejecting the boyfriend's attempts, which might not be fair, especially if the sister is okay with it. But given the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, the author's caution is understandable.\n\nIn situations like this, it's often better to talk to the sister first rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. By addressing the boyfriend, the author might have bypassed the sister's role, which could explain why she's upset. So, maybe the author's approach was wrong, but their concern was valid.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's method was appropriate. The author's intent was to protect their sister, but the method could have been more constructive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, but not for the intent itself. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the answer would be B (No), because the author's actions were a reaction to valid concerns, even if the delivery was poor. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) if the approach was too harsh.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author's main fault was not discussing this with their sister first, then they are partially at fault. But the boyfriend's actions are concerning, so the author's intent is justified. The problem is the method. So, the answer could be B (No), because the author acted out of concern, but perhaps the method wasn't the best. However, the direct answer might lean towards B. Alternatively, maybe A if the author overstepped. But given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
