My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author thinks he's an idiot, partly because he's young and made dangerous choices\u2014like driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is concerned about the guy's influence on their sister.\n\nThe issue is the boyfriend calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author felt this was inappropriate because they're not actually family. So, the author confronted him, saying he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. The sister hasn't responded since, and the author is now worried they might be in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The author had kept their opinions to themselves until now, showing they weren't being confrontational before. The boyfriend was showing up at their place and being overly familiar, which the author found annoying. The author's main concern is for their sister's safety, given the boyfriend's risky behavior. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's actions were dangerous, and the author's intervention might be a way to protect their sister. Telling him he's not family could be a way to set boundaries, especially if the boyfriend was overstepping. However, the author is the sister's relative, so they might not have the authority to dictate the relationship. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe she feels the author is overstepping. \n\nBut the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving with her in the car, associating with a dangerous person) are serious red flags. The author has a right to be concerned about their sister's safety. Confronting the boyfriend directly might be a reasonable step, even if it's uncomfortable. The author's message was a boundary, not an attack. The sister's silence could be from anger or worry about the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have approached the boyfriend in a harsh way. Maybe a more collaborative approach with the sister first would have been better. But given that the sister hasn't been reached out to, perhaps the author felt it was necessary to act alone. \n\nIn the end, the author's intent was to protect their sister and correct the boyfriend's overfamiliarity. While the method could be debated, the concern for safety is valid. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), as the author had legitimate reasons and the action was a boundary-setting move.\n"
