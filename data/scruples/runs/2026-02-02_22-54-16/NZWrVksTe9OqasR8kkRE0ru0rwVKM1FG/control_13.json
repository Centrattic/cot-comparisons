My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating him less than three months. The author has issues with the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving with her sister, associating with an ex-felon, etc. They kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited and calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author then told him he's not family, which might have upset the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main concern is their sister's safety. The boyfriend's actions are dangerous, which is a valid reason for concern. However, the author is not the one in a relationship with him; the sister is. The author's job is to voice their concerns to their sister, not directly to the boyfriend. \n\nBy confronting the boyfriend directly, the author might have overstepped. Even though the intentions were to protect the sister, how they approached it could be seen as rude or dismissive. The boyfriend was trying to build a relationship with the family, which is normal. The author's response may have been too harsh, especially given the short duration of the relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that the sister hasn't spoken to the author since suggests that the confrontation might have hurt her feelings or made her defensive of her boyfriend. The author might have been better off discussing their concerns with the sister first, rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. \n\nBut on the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is concerning. The author has a right to be protective. However, the method of communication was direct and dismissive. Maybe a better approach was to set boundaries without being confrontational, like avoiding the boyfriend's over-familiarity while still being polite. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's intentions were good, but the approach might have been inappropriate. They should have addressed the concerns with their sister first rather than confronting the boyfriend. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation directly.\n"
