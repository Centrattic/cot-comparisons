My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has concerns about his behavior\u2014drunk driving with the sister, associating with a dangerous ex-felon to buy drugs. The author kept their opinions to themselves until the boyfriend started showing up uninvited, calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which made the author uncomfortable. They finally told him he's not family, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The boyfriend was trying to bond, but the author felt it was too soon. The author's concerns are valid safety issues. Telling someone they're not family might come off as harsh, but it's a boundary. The sister might be upset because her partner is being rejected by her family. However, the author has a right to set boundaries for their own comfort and safety. The main issue is whether the author had the right to express that sentiment directly. It's possible the author could have communicated the boundary without being confrontational, but the situation is tense. So, the answer might lean towards B, as the author was asserting their personal boundaries, even if the method could be debated. They had valid concerns and were protecting their sister, but the way they did it might have been abrupt. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is about moral judgment. Since the author acted in self-protection and to prevent further intrusion, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
