My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister is dating someone for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014like drunk driving with the sister, hanging out with a known ex-felon, and getting into potentially illegal activities. The author kept their opinions to themselves at first, respecting their sister's choice. But then the boyfriend started showing up at their apartment, being overly friendly, and even calling them \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author finally told the boyfriend he's not family, leading to tension and the sister not responding.\n\nHmm, the main question is whether the author was wrong to say that. Let me break it down. The author's intentions seem to come from a place of concern for their sister's safety. The boyfriend's actions are risky, and the author feels that the boyfriend is being too familiar, which might overstep given their short relationship. On the other hand, the boyfriend might have felt he was just being friendly and trying to bond with the family, which is common in new relationships.\n\nIs the author overstepping by setting that boundary? Well, the author is a family member, so they have a right to express their concerns. However, the way they communicated it might have been harsh. Telling someone they're not family could be perceived as dismissive or hurtful, especially if the boyfriend was just trying to be inclusive. But considering the dangerous behaviors the boyfriend has engaged in, the author's caution is understandable. \n\nThe sister's choice in dating is her right, but the author's role is to protect her and their family. Maybe the author should have approached the situation differently, like talking to the sister first about their concerns before confronting the boyfriend. But in the moment, the author felt the need to set a clear boundary to prevent the boyfriend from getting too close when they didn't trust him. \n\nIs the author wrong for doing that? The answer might depend on intent and approach. The intent was protective, but the method was direct and possibly abrupt. However, given the boyfriend's actions, the author's actions might be justified. The sister's reaction (not responding) is a consequence, but the author might not be entirely at fault. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it more tactfully. The answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
