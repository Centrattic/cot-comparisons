My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves the sister dating someone for less than three months, and the author is concerned about this guy's behavior\u2014like drunk driving with her in the car and associating with a known felon for drugs. The author kept their opinions private until the guy started coming over to their apartment, calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which irritated the author.\n\nSo, the main question is: was it wrong to tell him he's not family? Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author has valid concerns about safety and the guy's judgment. The guy's actions are risky, and the author is trying to protect their sister. They might feel that by setting this boundary, they're preventing the guy from getting too comfortable with the family. Also, the guy was overstepping by trying to integrate into their family dynamic, which could be seen as intrusive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being direct and maybe a bit harsh. The sister is an adult and has the right to choose her partner. The author could have approached it differently, like talking to the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. By calling him out in that way, the author might have caused tension between siblings, especially since the sister hasn't been in touch since. The author could have been more diplomatic.\n\nBut the author's actions were in response to the guy's behavior that the author found concerning. The direct confrontation might have been necessary to set a boundary, especially if the guy was being too familiar. The key points are the guy's dangerous behavior and the author's attempts to protect their sister and family. The author is within their rights to express their discomfort, even if it comes off as blunt. However, the method of communication might have been a problem. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. They had good intentions but maybe handled it poorly. But they were acting out of concern for their sister's safety and family boundaries. The guy's actions were problematic, so the author's response, while direct, was not entirely unwarranted. The answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, because the intent was to protect their sister and set appropriate boundaries. The guy was overstepping, and the author had valid reasons to correct that.\n"
