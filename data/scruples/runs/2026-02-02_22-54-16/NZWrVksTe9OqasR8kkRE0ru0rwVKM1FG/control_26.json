My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The key points here are: the sister's boyfriend is involved in risky behavior, like drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now because it's their sister's choice who she dates. However, the boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. The author then told him he's not family but the guy's girlfriend's boyfriend, and now the sister hasn't spoken to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. The author is concerned about the sister's safety due to the boyfriend's actions. That's a valid concern. However, the sister is an adult and makes her own choices. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping because they're not the one in the relationship. But the boyfriend's behavior (calling the author family, showing up uninvited) might have crossed a boundary, making the author feel invaded. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach was direct and possibly harsh. Telling someone they're not family could come off as dismissive or rude, especially if the sister hasn't addressed the issue. The sister might feel the author is interfering. But if the boyfriend was being pushy and the author felt it was necessary to set a boundary, maybe it's justified. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the boyfriend's actions. If he's endangering the sister, the author has a right to be concerned. However, the author should perhaps have discussed this with the sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly. \n\nSo, weighing the two sides: the author's concern for safety is valid, but the way they addressed it might have been inconsiderate. The answer might be a balance. If the author's actions were meant to protect their sister and set boundaries against the boyfriend's overstepping, then maybe not wrong. But if they crossed a line by not respecting the sister's autonomy, then maybe they are. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key is whether the author had the right to confront the boyfriend directly. Since it's the sister's choice who she dates, the author shouldn't interfere in the romantic relationship. However, the boyfriend's actions (like showing up uninvited and using familial terms) might have been the trigger. The author's statement could be seen as necessary to stop the boyfriend from overstepping. Alternatively, it's possible the author acted out of frustration and didn't handle it the best way. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be justified in setting a boundary, but the method could have been better. However, since the sister is an adult, the author might be in the wrong for not letting her handle her own relationship. But given the danger involved, it's tricky. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're protecting their sister's safety and setting boundaries against the boyfriend's pushy behavior.\n"
