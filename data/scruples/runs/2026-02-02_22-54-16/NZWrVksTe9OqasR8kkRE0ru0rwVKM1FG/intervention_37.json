My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has issues with the guy because he made dangerous choices\u2014like driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging out with an ex-felon to buy drugs. The author thinks the guy is a bad influence but hasn't said much before. Now, the boyfriend is being overly familiar, calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" showing up uninvited, and attaching himself when they're at their mom's house. The author then tells him he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating now. The sister hasn't talked to the author since, and they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are the author's intentions and the actions. The author's main concern is protecting their sister from someone they see as a danger. They've kept their opinions to themselves until now but felt the need to set a boundary when the boyfriend started acting too familiar. The author might have overstepped by being direct and maybe harsh, but is that in the wrong? On one hand, the boyfriend's actions are concerning, and the author is within their right to express concern. On the other hand, the author didn't consult the sister first, which could have caused the rift. But the author did mention that they respect her choice to date him, just want to set boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of trying to be close with the family is common, but the author might have felt it was overstepping. Telling him he's not family could be seen as necessary for setting boundaries, especially given the risks. However, the way it was said might have been abrupt. But given the circumstances, maybe the author isn't wrong. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to protect their sister and set boundaries, even if it caused tension.\n"
