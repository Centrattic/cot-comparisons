My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister's boyfriend has been in a relationship for less than three months. The author thinks he's making dangerous choices, like drunk driving with the sister and introducing her to a dangerous ex-felon. The author is concerned but has kept to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. The author then told him he's not family but the guy my sister is dating. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). The key points here are the author's actions and intentions. The author's main concern is protecting their sister from a potentially dangerous relationship. They stepped in because the boyfriend's actions are risky. While the author might have come off as harsh, the intentions are protective. However, the way they addressed it might have been abrupt, maybe without considering the sister's feelings or the boyfriend's perspective. But given the danger involved, the author's action could be justified. The question is whether they overstepped. The boyfriend's behavior (showing up uninvited, trying to bond) might have been intrusive. The author's statement was a boundary, which might be necessary. So, maybe the answer is B (not wrong) because the author was protecting their sister and setting a boundary. But maybe there's a better approach, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong. The sister's autonomy is important, but so is safety. The author isn't the one in the relationship, so they're not the one to stop the relationship, but pointing out the danger and setting boundaries is their right. So, probably B.\n"
