My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not \"family.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister has been dating a guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the guy's behavior: drunk driving with the sister in the car, associating with a known ex-felon, and potentially buying drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now because they believe the sister has the right to choose her partner.\n\nThe issue arises when the boyfriend starts acting overly familiar, showing up uninvited, attaching himself to the author during visits, and using terms like \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author feels this is overstepping and tells him he's not family. The sister hasn't communicated since, possibly upset.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are boundaries and respect. The author is protecting their sister, recognizing the boyfriend's risky behavior. However, the way they addressed the situation might have come off as harsh. The author's intention was to set a boundary, which is reasonable. But the method\u2014publicly calling him out and saying he's not family\u2014might have been abrupt and disrespectful, especially without discussing it with the sister first.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions of trying to be close are common in relationships where partners want to integrate into the family. The author's response could be seen as dismissive. However, given the dangerous circumstances, the author's concerns are valid. The problem is balancing concern for safety with respect for the relationship dynamics.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, it's important to communicate concerns to the sister first rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. The author might have bypassed the sister, leading to the sister's silence. So, the author's action could be seen as inconsiderate towards the sister's feelings, even if the intentions were good.\n\nBut considering the safety aspect, the author is justified in wanting to protect their sister. However, the approach might have been better handled by first discussing with the sister, not the boyfriend.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They have valid concerns but handled it in a way that might have caused more harm by alienating both the boyfriend and sister. The answer hinges on whether the method was appropriate given the urgency of the safety issues. But since the author didn't approach the sister first, maybe they are partially at fault for not involving her in the conversation. However, the safety concerns are significant. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in their approach.\n"
