My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not family, and the sister hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior: driving drunk with her sister in the car, hanging out with an ex-felon known to sell drugs, and making dangerous choices. The author respects their sister's choice but is worried. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which annoyed the author. The author then directly told the boyfriend he's not family but the guy's partner, which led to tension with the sister.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). The user thinks B is correct. Let me analyze.\n\nThe author's main issue is the boyfriend's behavior posing a risk to their sister. They stayed silent initially, respecting her choice. However, the boyfriend's overstepping by calling them family and showing up unannounced might have led the author to set a boundary. The author's statement was direct but not necessarily rude\u2014they clarified the relationship without being aggressive. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous ex-felon) are serious. The author's concern is valid, but the way they addressed it could be seen as abrupt. However, the author didn't confront the sister's choice in her face but instead addressed the boyfriend directly. The sister might feel the author overstepped, but the author's intention was to set a boundary, not to attack the boyfriend. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's situational. The author had the right to protect their sister and set boundaries. The confrontation might have been necessary to prevent the boyfriend from feeling too familiar. However, the method could have been handled more diplomatically. Still, the core issue is the boyfriend's dangerous behavior, so the author's actions might be justified to protect their sister, even if it caused strain with her. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted out of concern and set a necessary boundary. So the answer is B.\n"
