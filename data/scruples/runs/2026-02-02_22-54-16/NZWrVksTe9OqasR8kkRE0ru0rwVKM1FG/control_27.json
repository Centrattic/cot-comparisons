My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The sister has been dating the guy for less than three months. The author is concerned about dangerous behaviors: drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon to buy drugs. The guy is young, maybe late teens or early 20s, and the author feels he's not a good influence but hasn't said much until now.\n\nThe key issue here is the author's confrontation. They told the boyfriend he's not family, which the guy took as a boundary. The author's reasoning is that despite the sister's choice to date him, the guy was overstepping by calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author's actions led to the sister being upset and cutting off communication.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author's main motivation is protecting their sister from what they see as a bad influence. However, the sister is an adult and has the right to choose her partner. The author's direct confrontation might have been abrupt and could have undermined the sister's autonomy. Even though the author's concerns are valid, the way they addressed the issue might have been harsh. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions (showing up uninvited, attaching himself, using familial terms) were indeed overstepping, but the author's response could have been more diplomatic. Instead of directly calling out the boyfriend in front of others or in a confrontational manner, maybe discussing concerns with the sister first would have been better. The author's approach might have caused unnecessary hurt feelings and strained the relationship with the sister.\n\nSo, while the author has legitimate concerns about the boyfriend's behavior, the method of addressing it could be seen as crossing a line. The sister's relationship is her own, and the author's public confrontation might have been inconsiderate of her feelings and the dynamic of the situation. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not handling the situation more sensitively.\n"
