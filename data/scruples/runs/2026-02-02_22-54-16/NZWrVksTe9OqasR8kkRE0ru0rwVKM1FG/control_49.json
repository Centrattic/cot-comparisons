My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister is dating someone for less than three months. The author clearly has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving with her sister, associating with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. These are serious safety issues. The author is worried about their sister's well-being.\n\nNow, the author has been keeping their opinions to themselves until now, respecting that it's her choice who she dates. However, the boyfriend started acting like he's part of the family\u2014calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" showing up unannounced, being overly familiar. The author felt it was time to set boundaries, so they told him he's not family and that he's just the guy their sister is dating now. The sister hasn't spoken to the author since, leaving the author wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a safety perspective, the author has valid concerns. The boyfriend's actions are risky and could endanger their sister. The author is trying to protect their sister, which is a natural instinct for a sibling. However, the way the author addressed the situation might have been abrupt or hurtful. Telling someone they're not family can come off as dismissive and might not address the underlying issues effectively. The boyfriend was probably just trying to build rapport with the family, which is common, but the author's response could have been more constructive. Maybe a conversation with the sister first, or a less confrontational approach.\n\nBut the key point is that the author's intention was to protect their sister and set boundaries, which is understandable. The method might be questionable, but the intent is not malicious. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their sister. The boyfriend's actions are concerning, so the author's reaction is a response to that. The sister's reaction (not speaking since) is a result of the confrontation, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for standing up for their sister's safety.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
