My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has been dating a guy for less than three months. The author has issues with the guy because he was driving drunk with the sister in the car and took her to meet an ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is concerned about their sister's safety but has kept their opinions to themselves until now.\n\nThe boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which made the author uncomfortable. The author then told him, \"You're not my family. You're the guy my sister is dating for now.\" The boyfriend just said \"alright\" and the author walked away. Now the sister hasn't contacted them since.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person) are concerning. The author is trying to protect their sister. However, the sister is an adult and has the right to choose her partner. The author's response might have come off as harsh, especially since the relationship isn't that long. The author might have crossed a line by not communicating concerns to their sister first, instead confronting the boyfriend directly. Also, the boyfriend was trying to build a relationship with the family, which is common, but the author's reaction might not have been the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns are valid given the dangerous behavior of the boyfriend. The boyfriend's attempts to be close might have been overstepping, and the author was asserting boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their sister and setting clear boundaries, even if it's a sensitive situation.\n\nI need to weigh the intention and the action. The author's intention was to protect their sister, which is understandable. However, the method of confronting the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first might have been a misstep. But considering the boyfriend's behavior and the author's right to set boundaries, maybe it's not entirely their fault. Also, the boyfriend's actions are risky, so the author has a right to be concerned. The key point is whether the author overstepped. Since the sister is an adult, the boyfriend's attempts to integrate into the family might be normal, but the author's response was a firm boundary. It's possible the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in their sister's best interest, even if the approach could have been smoother. However, the sister's reaction (not contacting them) suggests it might have been taken the wrong way. Still, the author's actions can't be said to be entirely wrong given the context. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
