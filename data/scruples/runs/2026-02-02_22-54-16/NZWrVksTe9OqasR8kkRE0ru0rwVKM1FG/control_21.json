My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not family, after the boyfriend was getting too close. The author's main concerns are about the boyfriend's dangerous behavior and wanting to set boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend has a history of drunk driving with the sister in the car and associating with a potentially dangerous ex-felon. The author is worried for their sister's safety. However, the author hasn't confronted the sister directly but instead addressed the boyfriend. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as crossing a line, especially since they are not the one in the relationship. But on the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is concerning, and the author is trying to protect their sister. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which might have felt overstepping. The author's response was direct but not aggressive\u2014just stating the truth that he's not family. \n\nNow, thinking about boundaries. It's the sister's choice who she dates, but family members often step in when there's a threat to their loved one. The author might have a valid concern for safety. However, confronting the boyfriend directly without talking to the sister first could be problematic. The sister might feel that her partner is being criticized by her sibling. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author's intent was to protect their sister and set boundaries, maybe not. But the method might be questionable. Instead of confronting the boyfriend, the author should have talked to the sister first to express concerns. By directly addressing the boyfriend, the author might have caused tension between the sister and her partner, leading to the sister not talking to them. \n\nBut considering the boyfriend's behavior\u2014drunk driving and involving him in dangerous situations\u2014it's understandable the author is concerned. The author's statement was a boundary, which is reasonable. However, the way it was done could be seen as rude or intrusive. The key issue is whether the author had the right to set that boundary without the sister's input. \n\nIn some cases, family members do step in when they see danger, but it's usually better to communicate with the person directly involved. The author's action might have been out of line because they didn't consult the sister first. But given the context, their concern is valid. So, maybe it's a nuanced case. However, the answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their intention was protective. However, the approach could have been better. But according to typical AITA standards, if someone is trying to prevent harm, even if the method isn't perfect, they might not be considered in the wrong. So I lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
