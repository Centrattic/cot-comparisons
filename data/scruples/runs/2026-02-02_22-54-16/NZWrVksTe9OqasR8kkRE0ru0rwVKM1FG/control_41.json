My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister's boyfriend has done some questionable things, like drunk driving with her in the car and hanging out with an ex-felon to buy drugs. The author is concerned about their sister's safety but has kept quiet until now. The main issue is the boyfriend calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found inappropriate. The author then told him he's not family, leading to tension with the sister.\n\nFirst, the author's concerns are valid. Drunk driving is a serious offense, and associating with someone who has a criminal background dealing drugs is risky. The author's sister is in a relationship with someone who has made dangerous choices, which raises legitimate safety concerns. However, the author hasn't confronted the boyfriend directly about those issues, only about the use of familial terms.\n\nThe key here is the author's approach. While the boyfriend's actions are problematic, the author's method of addressing it was to reject the familial label. The author might feel that the boyfriend is overstepping by trying to integrate into the family, but the boyfriend's actions are part of his relationship with the sister. The author's statement might have been a way to set boundaries, but it could come off as harsh, especially since the sister might feel her partner is being targeted. The author's sister might perceive this as an intrusion into her relationship, hence why she hasn't responded.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had the right to express their discomfort with the boyfriend's familiarity, especially given the risky behavior. However, the approach might not have been the best. A better approach could have been to talk to the sister first about their concerns about the boyfriend's behavior, rather than confronting the boyfriend directly about family labels. By doing so, the author might have alienated the sister, making her feel that her relationship is being judged without her input. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for caring about their sister's safety, but their method of addressing it might have been inappropriate. The answer could lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author's intentions were to protect their sister, even if the delivery caused issues.\n"
