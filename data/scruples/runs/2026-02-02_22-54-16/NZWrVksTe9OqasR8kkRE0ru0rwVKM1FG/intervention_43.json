My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The context is that the sister's boyfriend made some questionable decisions involving her, like drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend started acting like he's part of the family, even calling the author \"brother.\" The author then confronts him, stating he's not family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is an adult, so her choice in partners is her own. The author's concern is valid because the boyfriend's actions could potentially harm her. However, the author's method of addressing the issue might be problematic. Directly telling the boyfriend he's not family could be seen as harsh, even if the intent is protective. It might come off as dismissive of the sister's relationship, especially if the sister hasn't expressed similar concerns.\n\nBut then, the boyfriend's behavior\u2014showing up uninvited, being overly familiar\u2014could be overstepping boundaries. The author might feel compelled to set limits, especially if the sister hasn't done so. The key point is whether the author crossed a line in how they communicated their feelings. While the intent was to protect their sister, the method might have been too direct or abrupt, possibly causing unnecessary hurt or conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's perspective. If she hasn't confronted the boyfriend about these issues, the author stepping in might interfere with her autonomy. However, given the boyfriend's reckless behavior, the author has a legitimate concern for their sister's well-being. The challenge is balancing respect for her choices with the need to protect her from potential harm.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, it's common for siblings to have different boundaries with each other's partners. The author might be setting clear boundaries to prevent the boyfriend from becoming too involved in their family life, especially if they perceive a threat. However, the way it was communicated could be improved. A more diplomatic approach might have been better, such as discussing concerns with the sister first before addressing the boyfriend directly.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions stem from a place of concern for their sister's safety and well-being. While the method could be questioned, the underlying intent is protective. The main issue is whether the confrontation was necessary without consulting the sister first. If the sister supports the author's stance, then it might be justified. If not, it could be seen as overstepping. Given the information provided, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in approach.\n"
