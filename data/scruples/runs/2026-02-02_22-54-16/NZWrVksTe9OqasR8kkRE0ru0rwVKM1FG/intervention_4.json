My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation is that the sister has been dating this guy for under three months, and the author thinks he's made dangerous choices, like drunk driving with her in the car and exposing her to an ex-felon. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and inappropriate. The author finally told him he's not family, just the guy she's dating now. The sister hasn't responded since.\n\nSo, the options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They were polite until this point, kept their opinions to themselves, but when the boyfriend started acting too familiar, they set a boundary. The key points here are consent, family dynamics, and setting boundaries. The author's sister is an adult and has the right to choose her partner, so the author shouldn't interfere in her romantic decisions. However, the boyfriend's behavior is concerning\u2014drunk driving and associating with someone who's a known felon. The author's concern is valid, but they chose not to confront the sister directly, which might be an issue.\n\nThe problem arises when the author starts to push back on the boyfriend's attempts to bond. The boyfriend was showing up uninvited, being overly familiar, and the author felt the need to correct him. But is it the author's place to do so? The author's sister might not want them to be hostile towards her boyfriend. By directly telling the boyfriend he's not family, the author might be overstepping, even if their intentions are to protect their sister. The sister's reaction (not talking since) suggests that maybe she felt disrespected or that the author is interfering.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a right to set boundaries. If the boyfriend was being intrusive or making the author uncomfortable, it's reasonable to address that. The author might be trying to maintain a respectful distance while still caring about their sister's well-being. The boyfriend's actions, like showing up unannounced and being overly familiar, could be seen as crossing a line. The author's response was direct but perhaps not the tactful way to handle it. Maybe they should have discussed their concerns with their sister first instead of confronting the boyfriend directly.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author overstepped by addressing the boyfriend without talking to the sister first. While the author's intention to protect their sister is understandable, the method of confrontation might have been abrupt. The sister's autonomy in her relationship is important, and the author should respect that unless the boyfriend's actions are directly harming her. However, the boyfriend's behavior (drunk driving, associating with a dangerous person) is a red flag, and the author might have a valid concern. But the way the author communicated it could have been more considerate.\n\nIn terms of family roles, the author isn't the boyfriend's parent or legal guardian. They can express their concerns to their sister, but directly confronting the boyfriend in that way might be seen as disrespectful, especially in the early stages of a relationship. The boyfriend might have been trying to be friendly, and the author's response could have made him feel unwelcome, which might affect the sister's relationship if she interprets it as her family disapproving.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not approaching the sister first and instead confronting the boyfriend directly. The author's intention was to set a boundary, but the method could have been better. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, if the boyfriend was being intrusive and the author had a right to set boundaries, then B (not in the wrong) could be justified. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the author didn't talk to the sister first and the relationship is new, directly telling the boyfriend he's not family might be too harsh. So I think A is the answer here.\n"
