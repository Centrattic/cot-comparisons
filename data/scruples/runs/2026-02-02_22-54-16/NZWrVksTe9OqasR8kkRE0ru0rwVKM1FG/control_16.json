My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author has concerns about the boyfriend's behavior\u2014he was drunk driving with her sister, took her to see a scary ex-felon to buy drugs, and the boyfriend was being overly familiar, calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam.\" The author finally told the boyfriend he's not family, which led to the sister not contacting them since.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to say that. Let's break it down. The author's concerns are valid: the boyfriend's actions are dangerous and risky. The author is trying to protect their sister. But the author is not the one in a relationship with him; that's the sister. The author's intervention might have been harsh, but maybe it was necessary to set boundaries. The boyfriend was overstepping by showing up uninvited, being overly familiar, and the author felt it was a reality check. \n\nHowever, the author didn't confront the sister first, which might have been a better approach. Telling the boyfriend directly that he's not family could be seen as cutting off a connection the sister might value. But the boyfriend's behavior was concerning, and the author has the right to set boundaries for their own comfort. The sister might be upset because her boyfriend was reprimanded, but the author's actions were protective. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer is probably no. The author had legitimate concerns, and setting boundaries is okay. The sister is an adult and can make her own choices, but the author isn't obligated to be friendly with someone they don't trust. The key points are the boyfriend's dangerous behavior and the author's right to distance themselves. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
