My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister has been dating this guy for under three months. The author thinks he's a jerk, mentions dangerous behavior like driving drunk with the sister in the car and hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The boyfriend has been trying to get close to the author, calling him \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which is annoying the author. The author finally told him he's not family, just the guy the sister is dating. Now, the sister hasn't talked to them since.\n\nThe user says the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author kept their opinions to themselves, which shows they tried to be respectful of their sister's choice. The boyfriend's actions are concerning\u2014drunk driving with a passenger, associating with someone dangerous. The author has a right to be protective of their sister. The boyfriend's behavior of showing up uninvited and trying to ingratiate himself might be pushy. The author's response was direct but not aggressive. They didn't attack the boyfriend personally but set a boundary.\n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it differently. Instead of saying \"you're not my family,\" perhaps a softer approach to establish boundaries without making the sister feel like her partner is being rejected. However, the boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, and the author's concern is valid. The sister might feel like her partner is being criticized, leading to the fallout. \n\nIs it wrong to set a boundary? The author is protecting their sister and personal space. The boyfriend's behavior was overstepping. The author's message was clear. While the method might have been harsh, the intent was to protect family and personal space. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
