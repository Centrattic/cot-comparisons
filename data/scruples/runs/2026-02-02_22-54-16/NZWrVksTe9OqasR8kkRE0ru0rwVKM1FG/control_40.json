My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves some concerning behavior from the boyfriend, like drunk driving and associating with a dangerous ex-felon. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, mainly because they respect their sister's choice in partners.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's actions and the author's response. The boyfriend's actions are undeniably risky and could put his girlfriend in danger. The author, feeling that these actions are harmful, tries to set a boundary by clarifying that the boyfriend isn't family. The author's intention is to protect their sister, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, the way the author communicated this might come across as harsh. By directly stating that the boyfriend isn't family, it could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, even if the author's intentions were good. The sister hasn't communicated with the author since, which suggests that the message might have been received negatively, possibly hurting her feelings or making her feel that her partner is being targeted.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has every right to express concern about their sister's safety. The boyfriend's behavior is a legitimate cause for worry, and the author is within their rights to voice these concerns, especially if they believe it's in their sister's best interest. The challenge is balancing the expression of concern without alienating the sister or her partner. \n\nIn many cases, people might approach such situations by discussing their concerns directly with the sister rather than confronting the boyfriend directly. The author might have bypassed the sister, leading to the current tension. However, given the potential risks involved with the boyfriend's behavior, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary intervention to prevent harm.\n\nConsidering all factors, while the method of communication might have been problematic, the underlying concern for the sister's safety is valid. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but could have handled the situation more tactfully.\n"
