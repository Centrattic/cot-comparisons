My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend he's not family. The situation involves some concerning behavior from the boyfriend: drunk driving with the sister, associating with a dangerous ex-felon to buy drugs that might be more than pot. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now, but the boyfriend started calling them \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying and overstepping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend's actions are risky and potentially harmful to the sister. The author is a sibling, so they have a duty to protect their sister. However, the author didn't confront the sister about the relationship's dangers but instead focused on the boyfriend's attempts to be part of the family. \n\nThe author's main issue is the boyfriend's behavior in trying to be included as family. The line they drew was saying, \"You're not my family,\" which might have been a boundary. But was that the right approach? The sister's choice to date someone is her right, but the boyfriend's actions are concerning. The author might be trying to assert their authority without confronting the sister, maybe to avoid conflict. \n\nBut the boyfriend's actions (drunk driving, exposing the sister to danger) are more serious. The author might have a responsibility to address those issues directly with the sister instead of focusing on the \"family\" label. By telling the boyfriend he's not family, the author might be valid in setting a boundary, but perhaps the real problem lies in the boyfriend's behavior, which the author should address with the sister rather than the boyfriend directly. \n\nAlso, the way the author handled it might come off as harsh or dismissive, especially since the boyfriend was just trying to be friendly. The author might not be in the wrong for setting a boundary, but maybe the approach was not the most effective. However, the core issue is the boyfriend's risky behavior, which the author should have addressed with the sister first. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author's main issue is the boyfriend's attempts to be family, then maybe not. But if the real problem is the boyfriend's dangerous actions, the author should have focused on that. The answer might depend on whether the author overstepped by confronting the boyfriend directly instead of the sister. However, since the author was polite until now and only addressed the \"family\" issue, perhaps they are not in the wrong for setting that boundary, even if the approach could be improved. But maybe the author should have talked to the sister first about the risks instead of the boyfriend. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for the specific action of telling the boyfriend he's not family. The boyfriend's behavior is concerning, but the author's response was to set a boundary. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author had the right to set that boundary, even if the approach could be better. However, if the author should have addressed the sister first, maybe they are in the wrong for confronting the boyfriend directly. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's statement. The boyfriend was overstepping by calling him \"brother,\" so the author's response might be justified. So the answer is B.\n"
