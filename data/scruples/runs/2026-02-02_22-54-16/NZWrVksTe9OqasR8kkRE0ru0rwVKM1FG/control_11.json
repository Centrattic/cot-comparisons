My personal feelings are that he\u2019s an idiot.  I mean he\u2019s young (either late teens or early twenties, idk) so it\u2019s understandable.  I was an idiot back then too.  My problem with him is that he\u2019s made some dangerous choices with my sister involved.  He wrecked his truck with her in it driving drunk.  He also took my sister around this ex felon that everyone in town knows is scary dude just so he could buy some \u201cpot\u201d if it was really pot.  The guy sells a lot more than pot.  He\u2019s definitely not someone I want knowing or getting close with my sister.  \n\nDespite that, it\u2019s her choice who she dates so I\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself until now.  I think he mistook politeness for friendship or something.  He\u2019s shown up at my apartment to hang out.  When I visit my mom\u2019s and he\u2019s there he will basically attache himself to my hip.  Most annoying of all he started calling me brother and fam.  I know those aren\u2019t always specifically referring to actual family, but it\u2019s just what it\u2019s felt like.  \n\nIt really got under my skin quickly.  The last time he did it I told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not my family.  You\u2019re the guy my sister is dating for now.\u201d   He just said \u201calright\u201d and I walked away. \n\nHe\u2019s just trying to be friendly and get close with his girlfriend\u2019s family, I understand that.  It felt like it was time for a reality check on our relationship though.  I probably pissed my sister off in the process, I haven\u2019t heard from her since it happened.  \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that he's not family. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister has been dating this guy for less than three months. The author doesn't like him, thinks he's made dangerous choices, like driving drunk with her sister in the car and hanging out with a known ex-felon to buy drugs. The author has kept their opinions to themselves until now. The boyfriend started calling the author \"brother\" and \"fam,\" which the author found annoying. Finally, the author told him directly that he's not family but the guy the sister is dating now.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's concern for their sister's safety and the way they addressed the situation. The author had prior reservations about the boyfriend's behavior, which are valid concerns. However, the main issue here is the statement made to the boyfriend. \n\nThe author's actions: They told the boyfriend he's not family. The boyfriend might have been trying to build a relationship with the family, which is common in relationships. But the author's statement could come off as dismissive or rude. The question is whether this was the right approach.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries and express their discomfort, especially regarding the boyfriend's questionable actions. On the other hand, the way it was delivered might have been harsh, potentially damaging the relationship between the sister and the boyfriend, or causing tension. The author's sister might feel that her partner is being criticized, even if the author didn't directly criticize him beyond the \"family\" comment.\n\nBut the author's primary concern is their sister's safety. The boyfriend's actions (drunk driving with her, associating with a dangerous person) are serious. The author might be justified in wanting to protect their sister. However, the method of communication here matters. Instead of a direct and possibly confrontational statement, maybe a more private, respectful conversation could have been better. But the user isn't asking about the method; they're asking if the author is in the wrong for making that statement.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the statement was an overreach. The author is not the one being directly harmed beyond the sister's potential upset. However, the boyfriend's behavior could lead to real harm. The author's statement was a boundary setting, even if a bit harsh. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. The author's intent was to protect their sister and set boundaries, which is understandable. The boyfriend's actions are concerning. The statement itself, while direct, might not be wrong if the author felt it was necessary to prevent the boyfriend from overstepping. However, the way it was said could have been handled better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the best approach. \n\nGiven that the author had legitimate concerns and was trying to protect their sister, even if the method was a bit blunt, they might not be in the wrong. But there's a counterargument that the author overstepped by making such a statement, especially since the sister's choice in partners is her own. However, family dynamics can be complex here. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were acting to protect their sister and set boundaries, even if the delivery was harsh. The boyfriend's behavior was risky, and the author had a right to express their concerns.\n"
