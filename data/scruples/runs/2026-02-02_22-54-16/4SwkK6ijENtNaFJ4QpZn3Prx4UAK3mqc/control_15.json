Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for putting that \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is into guns and history, especially historical firearms. They own a Mosin Nagant made in WWII. They put the sticker as a joke, referencing the famous WWII slogan. The sticker is removable, and they have another unmodified version of the same gun. When someone at the shooting range called it insensitive, the author defended it by saying the phrase is historical and not meant to imply modern usage. The other person argued it could be interpreted as using the gun to kill people today, like other ideologies. The author's friends side with them, but they're questioning if they're wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: the sticker's historical context, the intent behind it, the comparison to modern implications, and the sensitivity of others. \n\nThe key here is intent versus perception. The author intended it as a historical reference, not a modern political statement. However, the person who criticized it perceived it as offensive because it could be seen as endorsing the use of the gun for violence today. The original quote was from WWII and tied to that era's context. The author is using it in that historical sense, but others might not make that distinction and see it as a modern statement, especially since the phrase can be co-opted in current debates about violence and ideology.\n\nBut then, the other person's argument that it's no different than using the phrase against other ideologies is a stretch because the original quote specifically refers to fascists (Nazis) and not other groups. The author's point about the historical origin is valid, but maybe the issue is that the sticker is on a functional gun, which could imply current capability, even if it's just for target practice. \n\nAlso, the fact that the person felt it was offensive enough to confront the author suggests that even if the intent was good, the perception caused discomfort. The author might not be in the wrong if their intent was purely historical, but if their action caused someone else to feel uncomfortable, there's a gray area. However, since the phrase is a known historical reference, and the author is using it in that context, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a bit of a subjective call. \n\nThe author's friends support them, and the sticker is removable and temporary. The original quote is from a well-known source, so the author's use of it as a historical nod is defensible. The other person's comparison to other ideologies is possibly flawed since the original phrase isn't meant to be a generic statement. So, considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
