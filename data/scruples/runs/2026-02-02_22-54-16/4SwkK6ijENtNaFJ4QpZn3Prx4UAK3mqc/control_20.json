Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the sticker is offensive or insensitive. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person has a historical interest in guns and uses them at the shooting range. The Mosin Nagant is from WWII, and the sticker refers to a quote from that era, specifically linked to WWII history. The person argues that the sticker is a historical reference, not a modern political statement.\n\nThe person's friend claimed the sticker is offensive because it implies the gun is used to kill people now, which the person disagrees with. The person also mentions that the phrase was used in WWII by someone like Woody Guthrie. They feel the comparison to using the same phrase for other ideologies is unfair.\n\nNow, considering the arguments: The person didn't intend any modern political message, just a historical nod. The sticker can be removed easily, and they have another unmodified gun. Their friends supported them, but they're still conflicted.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent versus perception. The author's intent is historical, but others might see it as insensitive, especially since the phrase has been co-opted in modern contexts. However, the phrase's original context is from WWII, so using it on a historical weapon that was used in that war could be seen as appropriate. However, the presence of the sticker on a functioning gun today might still be perceived as implying current use for violence, even if that's not the intent.\n\nThe line between historical reference and modern implication is blurry here. The author's defense is that the phrase is part of history, but if the sticker leads others to misinterpret it as supporting current violence, that's where the conflict arises. The author might not be in the wrong because they had no ill intent and the sticker is a historical reference, but they might not be entirely right either since others found it offensive. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong,\" which often involves intent and context. Since the author's intention was historical and the object is a historical artifact, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the sticker's placement on a gun today could be seen as trivializing the phrase, that's a different angle.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the historical context and the author's intent, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced case. The key is that the author had no malicious intent and the phrase is historically accurate. However, the potential for misinterpretation exists. But since the person is using it in a historical context and the phrase is from the same era as the gun, it's a legitimate reference. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
