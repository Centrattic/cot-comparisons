Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a historical rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the sticker and the reaction from others.\n\nFirst, the sticker itself is a reference to a WWII-era quote, originally by Pete Seeger for a song. The person explains that the rifle they own is a Mosin Nagant from WWII, possibly used against fascists. They put the sticker as a historical nod, not to imply current intentions. They also mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified one. \n\nThe person who criticized it argued that the sticker could be seen as implying the owner would use it to kill people today, which is offensive. The author retorts that the phrase is historical and not meant for modern politics. Friends supported them, but they're still unsure.\n\nNow, considering the context: the phrase's origin is historical, and the rifle is a historical artifact. The author isn't using it to promote violence against any group today but is referencing past events. The sticker is on a gun they use for hobby shooting, not for actual killing. The critic thinks it's insensitive because it might be misinterpreted as supporting current ideologies, but the author's intent is purely historical. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on the interpretation. If the intent was purely historical and not to offend, then maybe not. However, others can take offense if they perceive it as a call to violence against modern groups labeled as fascists. But since the author clarifies they don't mean to reference modern politics, and the sticker's origin is from the same era as the gun, it's more of a historical reference. The fact that the sticker is removable and they own another unmodified rifle shows they respect the historical significance. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a historical reference that some might find insensitive, but as long as they didn't intend to offend or promote violence, and the context is clear, it's more of a difference in interpretation. The answer is B (No).\n"
