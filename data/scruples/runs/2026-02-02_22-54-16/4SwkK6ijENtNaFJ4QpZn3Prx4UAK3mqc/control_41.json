Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They got some pushback from someone at the shooting range, and now they're unsure if they were insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is a history enthusiast and a gun owner. They placed the sticker on a WWII-era rifle as a homage to the historical context of the quote. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is well-known from WWII, associated with the anti-fascist sentiment of that time. The user's intention seems to be historical appreciation rather than a current political statement.\n\nThe criticism came from someone who found it insensitive, arguing that it could imply the user would use the gun to kill people in the modern context. The user counters that the phrase is tied to WWII history and not meant to reference current issues. Their friends supported them, but they're now doubting their own stance.\n\nNow, to evaluate whether the user is in the wrong. The key points are intent vs. impact. The user's intent is clearly historical and not to offend. However, the impact might be that some people could misinterpret it as a modern threat. But given the historical context of both the rifle and the sticker, and the fact that the phrase is a period-appropriate reference, it's more about honoring history rather than a call to violence.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that the sticker is easily removable and they have another unmodified rifle. This shows they were mindful of preserving the original, so their action was more about personal interest than disrespect.\n\nThe person who criticized them made a comparison to a modern political context, which the user feels is a stretch. The original quote is from a specific time, so using it in the context of a WWII-era weapon doesn't inherently make a modern political statement. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong. They intended to reference history, not make a controversial modern statement. The backlash is a difference in perspective, but the user's actions were respectful and context-appropriate. So the answer should be B.\n"
