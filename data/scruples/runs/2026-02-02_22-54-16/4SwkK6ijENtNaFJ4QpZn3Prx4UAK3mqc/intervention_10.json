Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The main issue is that someone found the sticker offensive or insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest, specifically in WWII-era weapons. The Mosin Nagant in question was made during WWII and originally used by the Soviets against Nazis. The sticker is a nod to the historical context of the rifle. The user argues the phrase isn't modern but comes from WWII, associated with Pete Seeger, and is used to reference the rifle's past role.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker compared it to using similar slogans for modern ideologies, implying it could be seen as threatening. The user counters that the sticker is purely historical and not relevant to current politics. Friends supported the user, but there's lingering doubt.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The key points are intent versus perception. The user's intent was historical appreciation, not a modern political statement. However, symbols and slogans can be interpreted in various ways. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" has historical roots but can be co-opted in modern contexts. The critic's concern is that the sticker might imply the user is suggesting they would use the gun against others today, even if that's not the case.\n\nGun ownership and historical items can be sensitive topics. The user is using an antique, unmodified gun, and the sticker is removable, which mitigates potential issues. However, the line between historical reference and modern implication is thin. The user might not be wrong in their intent, but others' perceptions and the potential for misinterpretation are valid. \n\nIn terms of social responsibility, even if the intent is pure, the symbol could be seen as insensitive to those who associate it with current events. The fact that the user's friends supported them suggests that not everyone sees the issue that way, but the critic's point isn't without merit. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They didn't intend offense, and the sticker's historical context is valid. However, the perception by others matters in social interactions. The answer hinges on whether intent alone absolves the action from being seen as offensive. Since the user acknowledges the possibility of being wrong but still feels justified, it's a nuanced situation. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the user's intent was historical and they took into account the historical accuracy, but there's a gray area. However, in the context of the question, the user isn't in the wrong, so B is the choice.\n"
