Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant, a WWII-era Russian rifle. The context is that the sticker is a joke referencing the historical context of the gun, and they argue that the phrase is from the 40s, so it's not about the modern political climate. A friend found it offensive, but their own friends supported them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key points here are the intent versus the perception. The author's intention was to reference the historical use of the phrase and the gun's role in WWII. The Mosin Nagant was indeed used by Soviet forces against Nazis, so the phrase fits the historical context. However, the issue is that the sticker is on a gun they own, and even if it's a historical reference, others might misinterpret it as implying current intentions.\n\nThe phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was originally a WWII-era slogan by Woody Guthrie, intended to boost morale and support for the war effort. The author is using it in that historical sense, which is legitimate. But the problem arises when someone else perceives it as insensitive or offensive. The author argues that the gun is used for shooting paper targets, not people, which is a common argument in gun ownership discussions. The friend's counterpoint is that the sticker could imply the author is using the gun to kill people, which is a different interpretation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for not considering the modern connotations or if the friend's reaction is overblown. The author is using a historical reference, but the phrase is still in circulation today, and some might see it as a call to action against current perceived \"fascists.\" However, the author's defense is that they never intended it to relate to the modern political climate, and the gun's use is recreational.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't causing direct harm. The sticker is a historical nod, and while it's true that the phrase could be seen as a modern rallying cry, the context here is a shooting range where the gun is used for target practice. The friend's argument is about the implication that the author might use the gun to harm others, but there's no evidence the author has such intentions. The author's friends also supported them, indicating that the community might not see it as offensive.\n\nHowever, the author might still be in the wrong if the sticker could be misinterpreted, even if that's not their intent. The phrase \"kills fascists\" could be seen as glorifying violence against a group, even if the group is from history. But since the author is connecting it to the gun's actual historical use, and the phrase was from the same era, it's a direct reference. The ability to remove the sticker easily also points to it being a temporary addition, not a permanent modification.\n\nSo weighing the intent, the historical context, and the potential for misunderstanding, the author's actions seem to be a matter of personal expression within a specific hobby. The friend's concern is valid, but the author isn't in the wrong because their use is non-offensive in the context they provided. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
