Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The user is asking if they're the asshole here, or AITA (Am I the Asshole).\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The person likes guns and history, and they have a WWII-era Mosin Nagant. They put a sticker from a WWII quote on their gun. Someone at the range found it insensitive or offensive, arguing that it implies the person might use the gun to kill people in the modern context. The author argues that the phrase is historical and not meant to reference current politics, and that the gun is just for target practice, not people.\n\nNow, the main points here are about context, intent, and perception. The author's intent was to reference the historical significance of the rifle and the original quote from WWII. They mention that the phrase was coined by the same person as \"My Land is Your Land,\" which is Woody Guthrie, so that's a historical context. The person who criticized it thought it's offensive because it could imply current intentions to kill, even if the author didn't mean it that way.\n\nThe key here is whether the sticker is offensive in today's context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference, but using it on a modern gun might cause some people to interpret it as a modern endorsement of violence against a group, even if the author's intention is purely historical. The author acknowledges that the gun is used for target practice and not for harm, but others might not see that and could misinterpret it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's argument is that they're honoring history, and the sticker is a nod to the past. They also mention that the gun is not modified and that they have another one, so it's not about the gun's function but about the historical context. However, even if the intent is good, the perception is that it could be seen as insensitive, especially given that the term \"fascists\" has current political connotations in some discussions.\n\nThe people at the range who supported the author might not be in the minority, but the critic's point is valid in that symbols can be interpreted in different ways. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the sticker's placement and the potential for misinterpretation could make it seem insensitive to some. However, the author is not using the gun to harm people, and the context of the range (target practice) might support that. The phrase's historical origin is a valid point, but the modern audience's interpretation can't be ignored.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the intent or the impact matters more. Since the author's intent was historical and the critic's concern is about modern implications, the author might not be in the wrong, but they should be aware of the possible interpretations. However, the critic's sensitivity is also valid. In AITA scenarios, sometimes it's about both sides having valid points. But the options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that the author's intention was historical and the sticker is removable and not permanent, it's likely they're not in the wrong. The comparison to modern ideologies might be a stretch, and the original phrase's context supports the historical use. So, the answer would be B.\n"
