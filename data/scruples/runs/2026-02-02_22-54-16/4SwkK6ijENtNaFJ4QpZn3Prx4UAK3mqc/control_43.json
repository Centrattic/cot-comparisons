Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a historical gun. The user is passionate about history and guns, and they put the sticker on a Mosin Nagant from WWII. They argue that the rifle might have actually been used in that context during the war, so the sticker is a reference to its historical use. The friend found it offensive, thinking it implies the author would use it to kill people today, especially in a modern political sense. The author denies that intention, saying they never meant it to refer to current politics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists.\" I remember that it was created by Joe Hill, a labor activist, in the early 20th century, and it was associated with the Communist movement. It was used during WWII, but the exact usage might have been in posters or propaganda. The Mosin Nagant was definitely a Soviet WWII-era rifle, so there's a historical connection there. But the user is using it today as a collector's item, not for actual combat.\n\nThe main issue is whether the sticker is being used in a way that's offensive or insensitive. The friend's concern is that the sticker could be interpreted as justifying violence against modern groups labeled as fascists. The author is arguing that the phrase is historical and not meant to imply current use. However, symbols can have multiple interpretations depending on the audience. Even if the author's intention is historical, the sticker might be seen as promoting violence, especially since guns are associated with potential current use.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the gathering. The user was at a shooting range with friends, so the environment is already one where guns are present. The sticker on a functional gun (even if it's historical) could be jarring to some people, given the current political climate where terms like \"fascist\" are often used in modern debates. The user mentions that the phrase isn't new, but the modern association might still be present.\n\nAlso, the user has another unmodified gun from the same era, so the sticker is just on one. They say it's easy to remove, which might mitigate some concerns. Their friends sided with them, suggesting that in their social circle, the sticker isn't seen as offensive. But the fact that a stranger or another person found it offensive means there's a public perception aspect here.\n\nThe key question is intent vs. impact. The author's intent was historical, but the impact on someone else was offensiveness. In such cases, even if the intent was good, the impact can't be ignored. The phrase's historical use during a time of war might not translate to a non-threatening context today. People might not make the historical connection and instead see it as a call to violence.\n\nHowever, the author isn't using the phrase in a modern political context, and they're not advocating for violence. The sticker is on a historical gun, and they're using it for recreational shooting. There's a difference between a historical artifact and a modern weapon. Still, the phrase \"kills fascists\" is inherently violent, and attaching it to a gun might be provocative regardless of intent.\n\nI need to balance the historical context with the potential for misinterpretation. The author might be in the right because their intent was respectful and historical, and they're not promoting violence today. But others might see it as insensitive because it uses the justification of past conflict to imply current approval of similar actions. The answer might depend on whether the context makes it clear that it's a historical reference. Since the user explains the historical connection, maybe it's okay. But if someone else doesn't know that context, they might take it the wrong way.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their intent was educational and historical, and they're using a historical object. However, the potential for misunderstanding exists. Since the question is about whether they're in the wrong, if the intent is benign and the context allows for historical understanding, then B (No) is the answer. But if the impact on others is the main consideration, maybe A. But generally, in such cases, intent matters, but the answer often leans towards not being in the wrong if the action isn't malicious.\n"
