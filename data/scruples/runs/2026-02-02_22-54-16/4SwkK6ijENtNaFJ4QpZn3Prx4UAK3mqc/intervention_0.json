Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The author explains that the rifle is from WWII, made in Russia, and they put the sticker as a historical reference. The person found it offensive, saying it implies the author would use it to kill people now, but the author argues that the phrase is from WWII and not referring to modern politics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was indeed a WWII slogan used by the US military, right? So the author is using it in reference to the historical role of the rifle during that time. The key point is whether the sticker is being used in a way that's insensitive today.\n\nThe critic argues that the sticker could be seen as implying the author would use the gun to kill people now, which is a stretch because the gun is used for shooting paper targets. The author clarifies that it's about historical context, not current intent. The friends agreed with the author, so there's some social validation there.\n\nBut why did the other person find it offensive? Maybe because the phrase has a modern resonance, especially with current political tensions. However, the original context is clear. The author also mentions that the Mosin Nagant was used by the Soviets against Nazis, so the historical link makes sense.\n\nI should also consider if the sticker is modifying the historical artifact. The author says it's easy to remove and they have another unmodified one. So it's not altering the original, just a temporary sticker. That might reduce the issue of historical respect.\n\nThe main debate is between historical reference vs. potential modern misinterpretation. The author's intention is clear, and they didn't mean to imply current political violence. The other person's concern might be valid in a general sense, but the author's explanation justifies the use as a historical nod.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They used a historical reference in a hobby context, made clear that it's not about modern uses, and the sticker is removable. The answer should be B.\n"
