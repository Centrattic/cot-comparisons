Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They provided the context from the AITA post.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest. They own a WWII-era Mosin Nagant, a rifle historically used by the Soviet Union during WWII, which would have been used against Nazis. The sticker is a reference to a WWII-era quote, which is part of historical context. The person explains that the rifle is modified with the sticker, which can be removed, and they have an unmodified version too. \n\nA friend group member found the sticker insensitive or offensive. The argument is that the sticker might imply using the gun to kill people in a modern context, which the author denies, saying it's about historical context. The friends are on the author's side, but the author is doubting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are intent, context, and perception. The author's intent was historical, referencing a specific WWII quote and the gun's possible use in that war. However, the sticker's phrase is a well-known historical reference, but when placed on a functional gun, even an antique, it could be perceived differently by others. \n\nThe controversy here is about whether the sticker trivializes violence or makes a political statement. The author argues it's about history, but the counterpoint is that it's insensitive because it could imply using the gun for violence today. \n\nI need to consider free speech vs. sensitivity. In the US, the right to bear arms and ownership of historical weapons is a right, and modifying items with historical references is part of free speech. However, in a public setting like a shooting range, others might find it offensive. The author's friends agree with them, but that doesn't negate the other person's feelings.\n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author didn't mean to be offensive and the sticker is a historical reference, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the sticker could be seen as insensitive regardless of intent, maybe they are. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was a propaganda piece during WWII, and while it's a historical reference, when applied to a gun today, even if it's for shooting at a range, it might be seen as glorifying violence. \n\nBut the author clarifies that they use the gun for shooting paper targets, not people, and the context is historical. The fact that they have an unmodified version and the sticker is removable shows they are aware of modifying the gun but not in a permanent way. The comparison to other ideologies is a stretch, as the original quote is specific to WWII context. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intent was historical and not to be offensive. Others might take offense, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author's intention was to reference history, and the sticker is a common historical reference. However, the sensitivity of others is valid, but that doesn't make the author in the wrong. The key is the intent versus the perception. If the author didn't intend to be offensive and the context is historical, they are not in the wrong.\n"
