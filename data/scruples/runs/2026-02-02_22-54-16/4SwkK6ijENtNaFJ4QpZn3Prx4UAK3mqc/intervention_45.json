Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a gun owner with a Mosin Nagant from WWII who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on it. The person is called out by a friend for being insensitive because the sticker might imply they'd use the gun to hurt people, even though the phrase is a historical reference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was a WWII-era slogan, so the author is using it in a historical context. They mentioned the gun's history and that the sticker is removable. The friend's argument is that the sticker could be seen as implying the user would kill others, which the author thinks is a flawed comparison.\n\nThe author's friends sided with them, but they're still feeling unsure. The key points are the historical significance of the phrase and the gun, the fact that the sticker is temporary, and the user's intent not to reference modern politics.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they are using a historical reference in a respectful and informed way. The sticker is a nod to the gun's possible role in WWII, not a call to violence today. The friend's interpretation seems to be a stretch since the phrase's original context is well-known. Additionally, the author is aware of the history and the sticker's removability. So the answer should be B.\n"
