Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The author explains that the rifle is a WWII-era Russian gun and they used the historical reference to the original quote from the 1940s. The main issue is whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive, especially given the context of guns and current political climates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the historical context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a real historical reference from WWII, created by Woody Guthrie. The user is using it in reference to the actual history of the rifle, which might have been used against Nazis. The sticker is placed on a gun that's part of their historical interest, not a modern weapon. The author also mentions that the sticker is removable and they own another unmodified version of the same gun.\n\nThen, there's the perspective of the person who found it offensive. They argued that the sticker could imply the user would use it to kill people today, especially with modern ideologies. The author countered that it's a historical reference and not related to current politics.\n\nThe friends sided with the author, but the author is still uncertain. The key points here are intent versus perception. The author's intent was historical and not to make a political statement now. However, others might interpret it differently, especially in today's climate where such phrases can be politicized.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't using the gun to harm people now; it's for shooting at targets. The sticker is a historical nod, not inciting violence. But does that make it acceptable? Some might still find it insensitive because of the association with guns and current events, even if the intent is historical.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's intent is clearly historical and non-offensive. Since the phrase has a historical origin and the gun itself is part of that history, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, others might still take offense, which is why the author feels conflicted. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the context and intent seem appropriate, even if some people disagree.\n"
