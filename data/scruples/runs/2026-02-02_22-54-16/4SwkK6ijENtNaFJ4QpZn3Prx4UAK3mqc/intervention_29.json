Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The author explains the context: the rifle is a WWII-era Russian gun, and the phrase is a historical reference from that time, originally coined by Woody Guthrie. The person who criticized the sticker argued that it implies the user might use it to kill people in the modern context, like other ideologies or groups.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author clearly states that the sticker is a reference to the historical context of the rifle and the original quote from WWII. They mention that the phrase isn't modern and is tied to the time when the rifle was used against Nazis. The author also notes that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified version of the same rifle. \n\nThe criticism is that the sticker is insensitive or offensive because it could be seen as suggesting the use of the gun against modern ideologies. However, the author's intention is historical, not political. The key here is whether the intent versus the perception matters. If the sticker's meaning is clear to those who understand its historical context, then maybe the criticism is unfounded. But if someone without that knowledge might misinterpret it, there could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the user's friends sided with them, indicating that others in their social circle see it as a historical reference. The author argues that the comparison to using the phrase for modern groups is a stretch, as the original quote was specific to WWII. \n\nI should also consider the sensitivity around such phrases. While the original intent was anti-fascist, using it on a gun might be seen as trivializing the history if it's not in the context of actual historical use. However, the author uses it in a way that honors the rifle's possible role in WWII. \n\nAnother angle is that the phrase \"kills fascists\" is a well-known historical slogan, so using it on a historical weapon in a hobbyist context is likely to be understood as a reference to the past. The person who criticized it might be overreacting, not considering the historical context. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention is historical, the context is clear, and they have an appreciation for the history of the weapon. The sticker isn't permanent, and the phrase is a historical reference. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
