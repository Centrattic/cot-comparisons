Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant gun is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person has a historical interest in guns, specifically a WWII-era Mosin Nagant from Tula. They put a sticker that's a historical reference from WWII, originally used by Pete Seeger for a protest song. The sticker is on a gun they use for shooting at a range, not for actual harm. They mention it's easily removable and they have another unmodified one. \n\nThe conflict arose when someone told them the sticker is insensitive/offensive, possibly implying the person might use it to harm others. The author argues it's a historical reference, not a modern political statement. Their friends support them, but they're questioning if they're wrong.\n\nNow, considering the context: the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference from the 1940s, tied to the fight against Nazis. The gun itself is a WWII-era military firearm. The author uses it for recreational shooting, not for violence. The sticker is removable and not permanent. \n\nThe person who criticized them might be conflating historical context with modern implications, especially since the phrase can be seen as a call for violence against certain groups today. However, the author isn't using it in that context. The key here is intent versus perception. The author's intent is historical, but others might misinterpret it as supporting violence now. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't intend to offend and provided historical context. However, they might not have considered how modern audiences could perceive it. The phrase, while historical, can still be charged today. Even if the author's intent is innocent, the sticker could be seen as insensitive, especially if someone else feels it's a call to violence. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's explanation shows they're aware of the history and are using it in a historical sense. They also have a legitimate interest in historical firearms. The fact that the sticker is removable and not permanent adds a point in their favor. \n\nBut does intent matter? In social contexts, sometimes the impact is more important than the intent. Even if the author didn't mean to offend, the sticker could still be seen as offensive. However, the person who criticized them might be overreaching, as the phrase has a specific historical origin. The author's friends supported them, suggesting that the community might understand the historical reference.\n\nSo, balancing intent, historical context, and possible modern interpretations, the author's action isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might be wrong in not considering the modern connotations, but the core of their action was a historical reference. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance. However, given the options, the best choice is B.\n"
