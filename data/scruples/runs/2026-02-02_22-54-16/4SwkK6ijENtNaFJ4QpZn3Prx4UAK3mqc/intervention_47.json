Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The author explains they have a historical interest and the rifle is from WWII. The sticker is a reference to a WWII-era quote.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was actually a slogan used during WWII, right? It's associated with the anti-Nazi sentiment of that time. The author is using it in connection with a historical weapon that could have been used in that context. \n\nThe person who found it offensive argued that it implies the author would use the rifle to kill people now, which the author disagrees with. The author clarifies they never meant it to refer to the modern political climate. \n\nBut wait, the key issue here is intent versus perception. Even if the author's intention was historical, someone else might misinterpret it in a modern context. However, given that the phrase is a historical reference and the rifle is also from that era, the author's use seems to be in line with historical appreciation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sticker is removable and there's another unmodified rifle, so they're not altering the historical artifact permanently. The friends also sided with the author, suggesting that others in their circle see it as a historical nod. \n\nThe argument that it's similar to modern provocative stickers might not hold because the original phrase is tied to a specific historical period. The author isn't using it to make a political statement today but to connect the artifact to its historical use. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
