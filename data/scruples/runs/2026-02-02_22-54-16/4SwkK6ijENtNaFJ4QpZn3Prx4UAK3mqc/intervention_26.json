Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person argues that the quote has historical context from WWII and that the sticker is a reference to the rifle's possible use during that time. They mention that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified rifle. The friend who criticized the sticker argued it's insensitive because it could be seen as implying the user would use it to kill people today, similar to using the phrase with other ideologies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent versus the perception. The author's intention is historical, referencing the original WWII context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was coined by Woody Guthrie, indeed in the context of WWII, as a protest song. So the historical reference is valid. The user isn't using it in a modern political sense but rather as a nod to the weapon's past role.\n\nHowever, the criticism is about how others perceive it. The friend felt it's offensive because it could be interpreted as advocating violence against modern groups. The key here is whether the intent matters in this scenario. Even if the intent is historical, the sticker might still be seen as insensitive by some because of the association with current uses of similar phrases. But the author's friends sided with them, suggesting that others might not see it that way.\n\nAnother angle: the Mosin Nagant is a WWII-era rifle, so the historical context is there. The author clarifies that the rifle is used for shooting paper targets, not people, which is a responsible use. The sticker's placement on a functioning gun might cause some to misinterpret it, but the author argues that the historical context justifies it.\n\nIs there a line crossed? The author isn't promoting violence against any group, just referencing a historical quote. The sticker is removable, so it's not a permanent modification. The main conflict is between historical appreciation and modern sensitivities. Since the author is aware of the potential for misinterpretation but stands by their historical reasoning, it's a matter of perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, while some might find it offensive, the author's intent is clear and rooted in history, and they're using the gun responsibly. So the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
