Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The author explains the context: the rifle is a WWII-era historical piece, and they put the sticker as a joke referencing the quote's origin from the 1940s. They argue that the sticker is a nod to history, not a modern political statement, and that the rifle is just used for shooting at the range now.\n\nSo, the key points here are the historical context of the quote and the gun, the author's intent, and the reaction from someone else who found it offensive. The author's friends supported them, but they're unsure if they might be wrong. \n\nFirst, the quote \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was famously used by Woody Guthrie in the 1940s, so the author is referencing historical context. The gun itself is a WWII-era weapon, so there's a direct connection. The sticker is removable and not permanent, which the author mentions, so it's not altering the historical item in a lasting way. The author also has another unmodified version of the same gun, which suggests they don't take the historical pieces too seriously in terms of preservation but still have a connection to history.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker argued that it could imply the author would use the gun to kill people now, comparing it to using the same phrase for other ideologies or groups. The author counters that the phrase is from WWII and not a modern political statement. The friends sided with the author, supporting their historical nod.\n\nNow, considering intent vs. impact. The author's intent was to make a historical reference, not to make a modern political statement. However, the impact on others might depend on how the sticker is perceived. The critic felt it was insensitive, possibly implying current intentions to harm others. The author's defense is that the phrase is historical, but others might not see the distinction.\n\nIn terms of ethics, freedom of expression and personal hobbies are important. Guns and historical items are part of some people's interests. However, the potential for misinterpretation exists. The author didn't mean to imply anything offensive, but if the sticker could be seen as trivializing the phrase or making a modern threat, there's a case for sensitivity.\n\nThe key is whether the author's use is insensitive. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a well-known historical reference, but in today's context, the term \"fascist\" is often used in political discourse. So, someone might interpret the sticker as a darkly humorous or even threatening statement, even if that's not the author's intent. On the other hand, if the author is clear in their own mind that it's a historical nod and not a modern statement, and since the gun isn't used for harm now, it's a matter of perspective.\n\nThe author isn't using the gun for violence, and the sticker is a removable addition. The original quote's context is from a time of war, which is different from today's peacetime use for hobbies. The author's friends agree with them, suggesting that some people might not find it offensive. However, the critic's point about the sticker's potential implication that the gun is for killing people now is valid. The author argues that the gun is only for target practice, but the sticker could still be seen as a provocative message.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on balancing intent and impact. Since the author's intent was historical and non-offensive, and the sticker is a temporary addition, they might not be in the wrong. However, the potential for misinterpretation exists, which makes it a sensitive topic. The answer would be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong given their intent and the context, but it's a close call where others might disagree.\n"
