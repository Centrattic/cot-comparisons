Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The context is that the rifle is a WWII-era Russian gun, and the quote was from WWII, originally coined by Pete Seeger. They argue that the sticker refers to the historical context, not modern times. The person who criticized them said it's offensive and compares to using it for other ideologies. The author's friends support them, but they're unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent versus the perception. The author's intention is historical and not meant to reference modern politics. They mention the quote's origin and the rifle's history. The sticker is removable and part of their historical appreciation. However, the critic argues that any such sticker could imply a modern political stance, even if unintended. \n\nThe key points are: historical accuracy, the original meaning of the quote, the context of the gun, and whether the use is appropriate. The author is clear about their intent, but others might misinterpret it. The phrase \"kills fascists\" could be seen as a call to action in current times, even if the original is from WWII. The sensitivity comes from modern political associations with fascism. \n\nBut the author also points out that the Mosin Nagant was used in WWII and the phrase is from that era. They're not using it to endorse violence against any group now. The critic's comparison to other ideologies might be a stretch since the original phrase specifically refers to WWII Nazis. The author's friends agree with their stance, supporting the idea that the context is historical. \n\nHowever, the debate is whether the sticker could still be offensive regardless of intent. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the presence of such a sticker on a functional gun might make some people uncomfortable, especially in today's climate where fascism is a charged term. The line between historical reference and modern political statement can be blurry. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is clear and rooted in historical context, the sticker's phrasing might still be misinterpreted or cause offense. The answer hinges on whether intent or perception is more important. Since the author didn't intend to offend and provided historical context, they are likely not in the wrong. But the situation is nuanced. The answer should be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong given their explanation and the historical context.\n"
