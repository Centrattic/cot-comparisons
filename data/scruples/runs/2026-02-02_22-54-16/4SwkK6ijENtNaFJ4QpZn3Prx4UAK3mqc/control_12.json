Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is a gun enthusiast with a focus on history. The rifle in question is from WWII, and the sticker references the original WWII-era slogan. The user argues that the phrase isn't modern and was coined by the same person who wrote \"My Land is Your Land,\" which was a protest song during the war.\n\nThe main issue here is whether using this sticker is insensitive or offensive. The user's friend thinks it's offensive because it might imply the user would use the gun to kill people today, which they didn't intend. The user, however, clarifies that the sticker refers to the historical context of the rifle's potential use during WWII, not modern politics.\n\nI should consider the intent. The user's intention is historical and not to make a political statement. The sticker can be removed, and the user has another unmodified rifle. The phrase itself is tied to a historical context, so the user's use might be a nod to that history rather than a modern slur.\n\nHowever, the friend's concern is valid because the same phrase is co-opted in modern times for various ideologies, which can be problematic. The user might not have considered how others could interpret it in today's political climate. Even if the intention was historical, the perception matters. But the user's friends supported them, suggesting that in their circle, the context is understood.\n\nThe key here is balancing intent versus perception. The user isn't in the wrong because their intent was historical and non-offensive. However, they might need to be more mindful of how others might perceive it, especially in different contexts. Since the user clarified their intent and the sticker is removable, the answer leans towards B. They aren't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where context is crucial.\n"
