Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The author explains that the rifle is a WWII-era historical piece and the sticker is a reference to the original WWII context. They mention that the sticker is removable and they don't use it for anything other than shooting at the range.\n\nThe person who confronted them argued that the sticker implies using the gun to kill people now, comparing it to similar phrases that might target modern groups. The author counters by pointing out the historical origin of the phrase and that the gun is just a historical artifact. Their friends agreed with them, but the author is unsure if they might be wrong.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's analyze. The key points are the intent behind the sticker, the historical context, and potential offense caused. The author's intent was to reference the historical use of the phrase during WWII, which is factual. The gun itself, being a WWII artifact, could have been used in that context. The sticker is a historical reference rather than a modern political statement. The author also clarifies that they don't use the gun for anything harmful now, just shooting at the range. \n\nHowever, the person who confronted them felt it was offensive because it could be interpreted as endorsing violence against modern groups. That's a valid concern from the other person's perspective, but the author's intention seems to be historical, not political. The phrase's original context is important here. Since the author made a clear distinction between the past and present and the sticker is on a historical item, it's more about historical appreciation. The comparison to modern uses might not be fair because the original phrase was tied to WWII. \n\nGiven that the author's intent is historical and the sticker is on a historical gun, they likely aren't in the wrong. The other person's reaction is about a different interpretation, but the author isn't promoting violence now. So the answer should be B.\n"
