Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a historical gun is inappropriate or offensive.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that the gun is a historical piece from WWII, and the sticker references the original context from that era. They mention that the phrase itself comes from a WWII-era song by Guthrie. They also clarify that the sticker is removable and that they have an unmodified version of the same gun. Their friends supported them, and the person who criticized them made a comparison to modern uses of similar phrases, implying that the author might be using it in a way that's politically charged now.\n\nSo, the key points are about historical context versus modern interpretation. The author didn't intend it to reference current politics, but someone else interpreted it as suggesting the use of the gun to kill people today. The debate is whether the historical reference is clear enough to avoid being offensive now.\n\nThe author's defense is that the phrase and the gun's history are tied to WWII, not modern times. They argue that the sticker is a nod to the past, not a call to action in the present. Their friends agreed with that view, but the critic disagreed, leading to a conflict of interpretations.\n\nI need to consider if the author's intent and the historical context are sufficient to mitigate any potential insensitivity. Since the phrase is from a specific historical period and the gun is also from that time, the author's use might be seen as a historical reference rather than a modern one. However, in today's climate, where historical symbols can be co-opted or misinterpreted, there's a chance someone might see it as endorsing violence against certain groups now.\n\nThe author didn't intend that, but intent vs. impact is a common issue in these discussions. The question is whether the impact here is such that the author is in the wrong. Since the author provided context and the sticker is removable, and they have another unmodified gun, maybe it's not the end of the world. Also, the phrase's origin isn't recent, so using it in the historical context might not be wrong. However, some might still find it problematic because the phrase can be applied more broadly now.\n\nBut the author's friends supported them, and they didn't mean to imply current violence. The critic's comparison to using the phrase against other ideologies is a stretch since the original context is specific. The author is probably not in the wrong, but maybe it's a grey area. However, given the details, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
