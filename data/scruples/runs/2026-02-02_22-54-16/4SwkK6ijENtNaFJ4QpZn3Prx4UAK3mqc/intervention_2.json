Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant, a WWII-era rifle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author explains they have a historical interest and use the gun at the shooting range. The sticker is placed on a historical piece, referencing a WWII quote by Pete Seeger. The original quote was used in a different context, so the author is using it in line with its historical roots.\n\nThe person who confronted them argues that the sticker is offensive because it might imply using the gun to kill people in the modern sense. But the author clarifies they meant it in the historical context of WWII. Also, the author mentions the gun is a common model and that they have an unmodified version as well, so the sticker isn't altering the gun's historical value significantly.\n\nThe friends sided with the author, and the author feels it's not about modern politics. The key here is intent versus interpretation. The author's intent was historical, but others might interpret it differently. However, the phrase itself is a historical reference, which complicates the issue. \n\nSince the author isn't using the gun in a threatening manner and the phrase is rooted in history, it's more about personal expression and historical appreciation. The person who found it offensive is making a judgment based on their interpretation, but the author didn't intend any modern political message. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
