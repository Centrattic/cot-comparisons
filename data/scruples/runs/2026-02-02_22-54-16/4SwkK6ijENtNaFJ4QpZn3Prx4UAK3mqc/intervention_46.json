Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person argues that the phrase has historical context from WWII and that the rifle itself might have been used in that context. They mention that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified gun. Their friend found it offensive, comparing it to using the phrase for modern ideologies, but the user thinks the comparison is off because the original phrase is tied to WWII.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the historical context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was indeed a WWII slogan, so using it in that context might be seen as referencing history rather than current politics. The user emphasizes that their intent was historical, not modern. They also mention the sticker is temporary, which might lessen the offense since it's not a permanent modification.\n\nThe friend's argument is that the sticker could be interpreted as implying the user would use the gun to kill people now, particularly with the modern political undertones. However, the user clarifies they never meant it to reference the current political climate. The friends sided with the user, which adds that there's some social context where others don't see it as offensive.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent vs. perception. The user's intent was historical, but others might perceive it differently. However, since the phrase has a known historical reference and the user is a history enthusiast, it's plausible that their use is appropriate. The fact that they acknowledge the sticker's potential sensitivity but feel it's a historical nod rather than a modern statement is important. Also, the sticker is on a historical gun, which might reinforce the historical context rather than a current one.\n\nThe main issue is whether the user's intent is sufficient to override potential misinterpretations. In freedom of expression terms, unless there's a direct threat or hate speech, using a historical slogan on a historical item might be protected. However, some might argue that using such a phrase on a weapon, even with historical intent, could be seen as insensitive, especially considering the weapon's potential use in violence.\n\nBut given the user's explanation and the historical context, it's more about personal expression tied to history. The answer might depend on local laws and societal norms, but without explicit rules against it, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friends' support also suggests that in their social circle, it's acceptable. So, the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
