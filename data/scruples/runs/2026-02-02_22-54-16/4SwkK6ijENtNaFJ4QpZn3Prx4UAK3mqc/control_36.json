Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is into historical guns, owns a WWII-era Mosin Nagant from Tula, and put the sticker as a nod to the quote's origin from WWII, which was a time when that phrase was used to describe the role of weapons in fighting Nazis. The sticker is removable and they have another unmodified version of the same gun.\n\nThe person who confronted them argued that the sticker could be seen as implying the author might use it to kill people now, comparing it to a modern context. The author defended it by pointing out the historical context and the original meaning of the phrase. Friends supported the author, but they're unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: intent vs. perception, historical context, and whether the sticker is offensive or insensitive. The author's intent was historical, not to reference modern politics. The sticker is a historical reference, and the gun is used for target practice, not violence. The person who found it offensive made a comparison to a modern context, but the author didn't intend that. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's intent matters or if the potential for offense is enough. In AITA scenarios, people often consider both intent and the impact on others. However, since the author didn't intend to be offensive and the sticker is a historical reference, it's more of a misunderstanding. The person who was offended made an assumption about the author's intent, but the author had no malicious intent. Also, the author takes precautions with the sticker (easily removable) and has an unmodified gun. Friends supported the author, so the social context here is that the majority see it as not offensive. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a historical reference, which is a form of expression, and the offense taken was based on misinterpretation. Unless there's a specific rule against such stickers in the range's policies (which isn't mentioned), the author's actions are justified. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
