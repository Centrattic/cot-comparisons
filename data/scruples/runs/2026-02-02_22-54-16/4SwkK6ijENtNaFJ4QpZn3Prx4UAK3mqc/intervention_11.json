Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a historical Mosin Nagant rifle is insensitive or offensive.\n\nFirst, the author explains their reasoning. They like guns and history, and the Mosin Nagant they have is a WWII-era Russian gun. The sticker reference is from a WWII-era quote by Pete Seeger, which was meant to highlight the role of firearms in fighting fascism during the war. The author argues they're using it in its original historical context, not in reference to modern politics.\n\nThe person who found it offensive thought the sticker implied the author would use the gun to kill people in the present day, comparing it to using the same phrase for modern ideologies. The author disagrees, pointing out the historical origin of both the quote and the rifle, and mentions that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified version of the same rifle.\n\nThe friends sided with the author, but the author is still unsure. The key points here are intent and context. The author clearly states their intent is historical, not to make a modern political statement. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is tied to WWII, and the rifle itself could have been used in that conflict. The sticker is removable, suggesting it's not a permanent alteration. \n\nHowever, the person who criticized it might be projecting modern sensitivities onto a historical object. The phrase has been co-opted in different ways over time, so maybe there's a disconnect between the historical meaning and how some people interpret it now. The author's defense about the historical context is valid, but the critic might not see it that way.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the intent is purely historical and respectful, and the sticker is temporary, then maybe not. But if someone else finds it offensive regardless, it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't using it to promote violence now, so B seems appropriate.\n"
