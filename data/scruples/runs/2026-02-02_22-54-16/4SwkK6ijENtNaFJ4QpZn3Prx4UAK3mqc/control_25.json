Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical gun. The author has a Mosin Nagant from WWII and put the sticker as a reference to the original quote from WWII, which they say was coined by the same person who wrote \"My Land is Your Land.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the sticker. The original quote is from 1941, associated with the song and the anti-fascist sentiment during WWII. The author uses it in a historical context, not necessarily to refer to modern issues. However, some people might interpret it differently, especially if they associate it with current political movements.\n\nThe person who confronted them found it offensive, arguing that the sticker could imply the author would use the gun to kill people in a modern political context. The author argues that the phrase is historical and not meant to refer to current events. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are intent versus perception. The author's intention is historical and personal, but the sticker's message might be misinterpreted by others. The phrase \"kills fascists\" is inherently linked to violence, which can be problematic even if the reference is historical. \n\nIn terms of sensitivity, the author might not realize that using such a phrase, even in a historical context, can be perceived as promoting violence or insensitivity, especially when it's on a weapon. While the author's friends agreed with them, the fact that someone found it offensive suggests that there's a valid reason to reconsider. \n\nAlso, the fact that the gun is a historical piece doesn't negate the potential for the sticker to be seen as inappropriate. Even if the sticker is removable, the message it conveys could be jarring to others, particularly in a modern setting where the term \"fascist\" is used in various political contexts. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the impact on others is important. The phrase, when on a weapon, might be interpreted as endorsing violence against a group, which can be offensive regardless of historical context. Therefore, the author might have a point in their defense, but there's a valid argument that the sticker could be seen as insensitive or offensive by others, even if that's not the intention.\n"
