Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The situation involves some context about the gun's history and the intent behind the sticker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author claims the sticker is a reference to the original WWII context and the famous Woody Guthrie quote. They mention that the gun is historically significant, possibly from WWII, and that the sticker is removable and not a permanent modification. Their friends sided with them, and they argue that the phrase isn't modern but has historical roots.\n\nThe person who found it offensive thought the sticker implied the gun could be used to kill people today, especially given the modern political climate. The author counters that the phrase was meant for historical context, not current ideologies. \n\nI should check if the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" has a well-known historical background. Yes, it was part of Woody Guthrie's lyrics in the 1940s, and it's often associated with WWII. The original intent was to inspire support against fascism during the war. However, in today's context, the term \"fascist\" is sometimes used in political discourse differently, which might cause confusion or offense.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus perception. The author's intent was historical, but someone else perceived it as promoting violence against modern groups. The question is whether the intent matters or if the potential for offense is enough to say the author is in the wrong. \n\nAlso, considering free speech, the author has the right to express themselves, but in a public setting like a shooting range, others might react to their expression. The author isn't using the gun to harm anyone, just displaying it at the range with friends. The sticker is removable, so it's a temporary modification.\n\nAnother angle: the person who complained made a comparison to using the phrase for other ideologies. The author might argue that the original phrase was specifically about WWII and not meant to be a flexible label today. However, the line between historical reference and modern application can be blurry. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author didn't intend to offend, but might they be responsible if someone takes it out of context? It's a common debate in free speech issues. If the phrase is historically accurate and the context is clear, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the modern audience is likely to misinterpret it, there's a case for sensitivity.\n\nI think the author's use is a legitimate historical reference, especially since they explain the context and the sticker is temporary. The fact that they have another unmodified gun shows they respect the historical value. The friend's objection might be a matter of opinion rather than the author's wrongdoing. So leaning towards answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
