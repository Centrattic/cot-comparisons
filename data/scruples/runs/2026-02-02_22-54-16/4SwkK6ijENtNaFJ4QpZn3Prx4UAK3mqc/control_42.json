Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person argues that the quote is from WWII, specifically tied to the rifle's possible use during that time, and that the sticker is a historical reference rather than a modern political statement. They also mention that the gun is a common model and the sticker is removable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the quote. \"This machine kills fascists\" was used during WWII, associated with the film \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and later with resistance movements. The user is using it on a rifle that was manufactured during WWII, so they might see it as a nod to its historical role. However, some people today might interpret it differently, possibly as a modern political statement or as insensitive given current events or the weapon's nature.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus perception. The user's intent is historical and educational, but others might find the phrase offensive when applied to a weapon, regardless of context. The sticker could be seen as trivializing the violence of war or making a provocative statement in the current political climate. The user's friends agreed with them, but others might disagree, as shown when someone at the range called it insensitive.\n\nFactors to consider: Is using a historical quote on a weapon inherently offensive? How does the audience's interpretation affect this? Since the user clarifies they don't use it for modern politics and the gun isn't used offensively now, but the sticker could be misinterpreted. Also, the fact that it's a common gun and the sticker is removable lessens the argument about modification, but the phrase itself might still carry weight.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The user isn't malicious, but they might not have considered how others could take it. The person who criticized it made a comparison to modern ideologies, which the user found unfair. However, the quote's original context is separate from its possible modern interpretations. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they might need to be more mindful of how their actions are perceived by others, even if their intent is pure. The answer leans towards B, but with a note that it's a matter of perspective.\n"
