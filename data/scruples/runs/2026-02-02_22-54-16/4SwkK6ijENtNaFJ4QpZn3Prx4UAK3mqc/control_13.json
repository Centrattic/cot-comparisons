Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They argue that the quote is historically from WWII and they're referencing the rifle's possible use during that time. The person who confronted them says it's offensive because it could imply using the gun to kill people now, especially with modern politics in mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the historical context. The original phrase was used during WWII, so the author is using it in a historical context. They mention that the rifle was made during WWII and that the sticker is a joke referencing that era. The key point is whether the sticker is being used in a way that's respectful or if it's being co-opted for modern political statements.\n\nThe person who confronted them thinks it's offensive because it might suggest using the gun to kill people today, which is a different context. The author is using an antique gun for recreational shooting, not for actual combat. The sticker can be removed easily, and they have another unmodified gun. The friends side with the author, but they're unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nI should also consider if the phrase \"kills fascists\" is inherently offensive. Since the original intent was WWII-related, using it in that historical context might not be wrong. However, in today's climate where the term \"fascist\" is sometimes used in political arguments, the sticker might be seen as making a modern political statement. The line between historical reference and modern political use is blurry here.\n\nThe author's intention matters. They didn't mean to refer to modern issues and are using it as a historical nod. But others might not see the distinction and find it insensitive, especially if they associate it with current ideologies. The debate between the author and the person who confronted them shows that both sides have valid points based on context and interpretation.\n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how the sticker is perceived. If the main use is historical and not to promote violence against any group in the present, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if it's seen as trivializing violence or being used in a way that could be misinterpreted, then there might be some validity to the other person's concern. Since the author is using it in a historical context and for recreational purposes, the answer might lean towards No (B), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
