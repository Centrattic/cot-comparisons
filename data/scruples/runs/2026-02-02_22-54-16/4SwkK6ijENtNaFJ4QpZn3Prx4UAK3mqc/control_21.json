Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points are the context of the sticker, the historical background of the rifle, and the others' reactions.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was coined during WWII by Woody Guthrie, right? It's tied to the historical context of fighting Nazis. The author is using it on a rifle that was made during that era, possibly used in the war. They mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified gun. They argue that the phrase isn't modern and that the rifle now just shoots paper targets.\n\nThe person who found it offensive compared it to using the phrase against other groups, implying it could be used to justify violence today. The author disagrees, thinking it's a historical reference. The friends sided with the author, but he still feels unsure.\n\nNow, deciding if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether using the historical phrase on a functional firearm, even with historical context, could be offensive in a modern context. The author didn't intend to reference modern politics, but the phrase's current associations might still cause offense. However, considering the historical link and the fact that the gun is used for sport, not violence, one could argue it's a respectful nod. On the other hand, even if unintended, the sticker might be seen as insensitive because it's on a real gun, which could evoke current debates about gun control or violence. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether intent matters more than potential offense. The author's intent was historical, but the presence of the sticker on a working gun might lead others to see it as a call to violence. However, since the author is using it in a historical context and the phrase itself is from a non-violent source (Woody Guthrie advocating for equality), it's a nuanced case. The comparison to other ideologies is a stretch, as the original phrase was specific to WWII. The fact that friends agree with the author suggests some support, but the other person's valid concern about implications can't be ignored. \n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if the intent was historical and they're not promoting violence, but they might be oblivious to how others perceive it. However, given the context, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
