Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points are the context and intent behind the sticker.\n\nFirst, the author explains that the gun is a historical piece from WWII, and the sticker references a WWII-era quote by Pete Seeger. They mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified gun. They argue that the sticker's intent is historical, not to imply current political violence. \n\nThe person who confronted them thought the sticker was offensive because it could be seen as justifying using the gun to kill others today. The author disagrees, pointing out the historical origin of the quote and the gun's role in WWII.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's use of the sticker is insensitive. The author's intent was historical, but others might misinterpret it. However, the author isn't using the gun for violent purposes now, just for shooting at targets. The friends supported them, and the author didn't mean to reference modern politics. The sticker is a historical reference, so maybe it's not the author's fault others take it the wrong way. But maybe the author should consider how it's perceived today, even if that's not their intent.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author isn't acting with malicious intent, and the sticker has a historical context. However, symbols can be controversial. But since the author clarifies their intent and the context is historical, they might not be in the wrong. So, probably answer B (No).\n"
