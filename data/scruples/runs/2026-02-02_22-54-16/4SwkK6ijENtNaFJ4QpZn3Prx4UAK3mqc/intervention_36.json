Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person argues that the sticker is a historical reference to WWII, since the rifle might have been used in that context. They also mention that the sticker is easily removable and they own another unmodified version of the same rifle. The dispute arose when someone else found the sticker offensive, interpreting it as implying the rifle could be used to kill people in the modern context, which the author denies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is historically tied to WWII, as the user notes, originating from a famous quote by Pete Seeger. The user's intention is clearly to reference that historical period. However, the other person's objection is about the modern implication. The key here is whether the sticker's meaning is solely historical or if it could be seen as insensitive today.\n\nThe user's friends sided with them, which suggests that their perspective is shared by others. However, the other person's concern is about the potential offensive nature in the current political climate. The question is whether the user's use of the sticker, even with historical intent, crosses into insensitivity by potentially implying support for using the rifle to kill people now. The user argues they don't intend that, but intent vs. impact matters here.\n\nAnother angle is the modification of an antique. The user says it's easily removable and they have another unmodified rifle. This lessens the argument that it's damaging the historical artifact. But the main issue is the sticker's message. The user's position is that the phrase is part of history, not a call to action today. The other person's comparison to other ideologies might be a stretch, but the concern is about how others perceive it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the user intended it historically and didn't mean to offend, but others take offense, is that the user's fault? It's a subjective matter. Some might say that even if the intent is good, the impact matters, so the user should avoid causing offense. Others might say that the historical context justifies the use and that the sticker isn't intended to be taken literally today.\n\nGiven that the user is a history enthusiast and the sticker is part of that interest, and they made it clear they don't use the rifle for anything but shooting at paper, their position seems reasonable. The other person's interpretation might be a stretch, but the user might need to consider the perception of others. However, since the user is using the phrase as a historical reference and not promoting violence now, it's debatable whether they're in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the intent was historical, and the user took steps to preserve the original rifle.\n"
