Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The situation revolves around whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person has a historical interest in guns, specifically a WWII-era Russian rifle. They put a sticker on it that's a reference to a WWII-era quote from Woody Guthrie. The person argues that the sticker is a historical nod, given the rifle's possible use during the war. However, someone else found it offensive, suggesting it implies the user would use the gun to kill others today, similar to other ideologies.\n\nSo, the key points here are the historical context of the phrase, the intent of the person putting the sticker, and the perspective of those who found it offensive. The user is asking if they're at fault. \n\nI should consider the history of the phrase. The original quote was meant to highlight the role of machines in the struggle against fascism during WWII. The user is using it in a historical context, which they believe is accurate given the gun's origin. They also mention that the gun is a common model and they have another unmodified one, so the sticker is removable and not a permanent alteration.\n\nOn the other hand, the person who found it offensive might be interpreting the sticker in a modern context, associating the phrase with current political tensions. They might see it as a call to action or as trivializing the original message by applying it to a personal weapon now. The argument that it's similar to other ideologies is a point against the user's position.\n\nThe user's friends supported them, but they're still questioning if they're wrong. The user's intent was historical, not to make a political statement today. However, others might not see the distinction, especially if they're not aware of the historical context. \n\nNow, considering all this, whether the user is in the wrong depends on intent versus perception. If the user clearly intended a historical reference and there's no evidence they meant to offend, then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the sticker could be reasonably perceived as offensive by others, even without intent, there might be some responsibility there. \n\nAlso, the fact that the sticker is removable and the user has another gun without it suggests they aren't forcing others to see it. But when bringing it to a shooting range, others might encounter it, so the user should be aware of how it's perceived in that social setting.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's intent was historical, supported by the origin of the phrase and the gun's background. However, others might misinterpret it, leading to the conflict. Whether this makes them at fault is debatable. Since the user didn't intend to offend and the sticker is historical, the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong, but there's a valid argument the other way. However, based on the information given, the answer would be B (No).\n"
