Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The situation is that someone at the shooting range found it insensitive or offensive, and the friends sided with the author, but the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the sticker. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was used during WWII, right? It's a historical reference. The Mosin Nagant is a Russian rifle from that era, so the author is connecting the two. The person who criticized it said it implies the author would use the gun to kill people now, even though it's just a historical piece. The author argues it's a joke and a nod to history, not a modern political statement.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I have to consider the intent, the context, and the potential offense caused. The author didn't intend any modern connotations, just a historical one. They mentioned it's a sticker that can be removed easily and they have another unmodified gun. The friends agreed with the author, which suggests that in their circle, it's not seen as offensive. The critic made a comparison to using similar stickers for other ideologies, which the author found a bad analogy. \n\nThe key points are the historical intent versus the possible modern interpretation. The phrase itself is from a time when it was a rallying cry against actual fascists (Nazi Germany, etc.), so using it on a gun from that period could be seen as a respectful nod. However, others might take it differently, especially if they associate the term \"fascists\" with current political groups. The author's explanation clarifies their intent, but the critic didn't seem to acknowledge that nuance. \n\nSince the author is using a historical reference on a historical gun and the sticker is removable, it's more of a personal expression of interest in history. The fact that friends supported them and there's no evidence that the author is being malicious, the answer would likely be B. The confusion from the critic is understandable, but the author isn't in the wrong if their intent was purely historical and they made that clear. The phrase's original context is important here, and as long as it's not being used to promote violence towards any group today, it's a matter of perspective.\n"
