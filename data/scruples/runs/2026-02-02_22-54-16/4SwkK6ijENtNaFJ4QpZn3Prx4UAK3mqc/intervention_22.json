Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is into historical guns and has a Mosin Nagant from WWII. The sticker is a reference to a well-known WWII-era slogan, which was used by Woody Guthrie on his guitar. The Mosin was a common Soviet rifle during that time, so the author's point is that the rifle might have actually been used to kill fascists. They also mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified one. \n\nThe person who confronted them argued that the sticker is insensitive or offensive because it could imply the author uses it to kill people now, even if the context is historical. The author counters by saying the phrase isn't a modern invention and is tied to the original historical context. Friends sided with the author, but the author is second-guessing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: intent (the author meant it historically), the actual historical use of the rifle, the sticker's origin in WWII, and the fact that it's a non-permanent addition. The other person's concern is about modern implications, like using the phrase to target current ideologies or groups, which the author denies. \n\nThe phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was indeed a historical tagline from the era it's associated with. The author is using it in reference to the rifle's possible past. The context of the shooting range is about firing at targets, not people. The Mosin Nagant was a standard military rifle, so it's plausible it was used in that way. The author isn't altering the gun's historical value permanently with the sticker. \n\nThe person who found it offensive might be conflating the historical phrase with modern usage. For example, if someone used the same phrase on a modern weapon in a political context, it could be problematic. But in this case, the author is using it in a historical context, and the environment is a shooting range where people are shooting at targets. \n\nThe comparison made by the acquaintance to other ideologies or groups is a stretch. The original slogan was specifically about WWII and Nazis, not current issues. The author's argument that it's a historical reference holds weight. Also, the fact that the sticker can be removed easily suggests it's not a permanent or disrespectful alteration. \n\nHowever, the author should consider the sensitivity of others. Even if they didn't mean it offensively, some people might misinterpret the sticker. But given the context and the author's explanation, it seems like it's a reasonable historical nod. The friends supporting the author also indicate that the community they're in understands the context. \n\nSo, based on the information provided, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a historical reference with a collectible gun, and the sticker isn't permanent. The other person's reaction seems out of context with the actual historical use and the author's intent. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
