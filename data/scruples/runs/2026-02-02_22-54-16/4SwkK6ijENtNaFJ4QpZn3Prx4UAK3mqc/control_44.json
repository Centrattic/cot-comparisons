Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is into historical guns and uses the rifle for shooting at a range. The gun is from WWII, and the sticker is a reference to a historical quote. They mention that the original phrase was from WWII and is tied to the time when the rifle was used. They also say the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified version.\n\nThe person who confronted them thought it was insensitive or trashy, arguing that it might imply they'd use the gun to kill people today, similar to modern ideologies. The original poster argues that the sticker is about the historical context and not the modern day. Their friends agreed with them.\n\nNow, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The key points to consider are the intent vs. the perception. The author's intent was historical reference, but the other person's interpretation was different. The sticker's original meaning is tied to WWII, but when applied to a modern gun, even if it's historical, could it be misread? \n\nThe author didn't mean to reference modern politics, but the phrase has been used in various contexts today. The fact that the gun is a historical piece and the sticker is based on a historical quote supports their argument. However, the way it's placed on a gun might still cause discomfort to some people, even if the intention is purely historical. \n\nBut since the author made it clear it's a historical reference and the sticker is temporary, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The person who complained made a different interpretation, but the author's explanation seems valid. So, the answer might be B (No), because their intent was not malicious, and they were referencing history. However, there's a case to be made that symbols on guns can be sensitive regardless of intent. But given the context and the author's explanation, they're probably not in the wrong.\n"
