Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is at fault. The context is that the rifle is a WWII-era gun, and the sticker's phrase comes from a WWII origin. They argue it's historical, and that the sticker is removable. The person who criticized it thinks it's offensive because it implies using the gun to kill people now, possibly trivializing violence or modern politics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the history of the phrase. \"This machine kills fascists\" was indeed a slogan from WWII, associated with the song \"This Is Thy Hour and Thy Day of Triumph\" by Woody Guthrie, and was used in propaganda. So the phrase has historical context related to fighting fascism, not modern times. The user's argument is that they're referencing the historical role of the weapon, not making a modern political statement. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the gun being a historical artifact. The user mentions another unmodified Mosin, and that these guns are common. The sticker is removable, so it's not a permanent alteration. The user's friends support them, but the critic saw it as offensive. \n\nThe crux of the issue is whether using a historical slogan on a historical weapon in a recreational context is insensitive. The critic's concern is that it could be seen as endorsing violence against a group, even if the user's intent is purely historical. But the user's explanation is rooted in historical context, not modern politics. \n\nI should consider if intent matters. The user didn't mean to reference current issues, but does the sticker's message still have potential to be offensive? The phrase, while historical, is a call to action against fascism. Using it on a gun might imply willingness to use the gun for such a purpose, even if it's just for shooting paper. However, the user clarifies that they don't use it in the modern context and it's part of their interest in historical guns.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of free expression versus potential offense. The user has a right to modify their property as they see fit, but they also have to consider others' feelings. Since the user's friends didn't take offense and the context is recreational, maybe it's not their fault. However, the critic's point is valid in that symbols can have different meanings to different people. \n\nBut the user is making a historical reference, not a modern political one. The phrase is tied to its original time period. So the user isn't necessarily in the wrong if their intent is historical appreciation. However, the sticker might still be seen as insensitive by some due to the nature of the phrase. But the user hasn't acted in a way that's harmful, just expressed their history interest. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because their intent is historical and the context is recreational, with no malicious intent. The sticker is a nod to history, not a modern political statement, and they provided explanations. While the critic might find it offensive, the user's actions don't make them at fault.\n"
