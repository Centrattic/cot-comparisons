Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The main points are about whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive.\n\nFirst, the person explains their reasoning: they love history, the rifle is a WWII-era Russian gun, and the sticker references a historical quote from WWII. They argue that the phrase isn't about modern politics, just the historical context. They also mention that the sticker is removable and they own another unmodified gun from the same era.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker argued that it implies the owner would use the gun to kill people now, comparing it to other offensive slogans. The author disagrees with the comparison, pointing out the phrase's origin in WWII by the same person who wrote \"This Land Is Your Land.\"\n\nSo, the key factors here are intent vs. perception. The author's intent was to reference historical context, but someone else found it offensive because it could be seen as implying modern use. Also, the context of the gun being a historical artifact versus a modern weapon matters. The original quote was a response to the Great Depression and WWII, so using it with a WWII-era gun might be a direct reference. However, in today's climate, where terms like \"fascist\" are used in political debates, the sticker might be misinterpreted.\n\nThe question is whether the author's use of the sticker is insensitive. The author isn't using it to promote violence but to acknowledge historical context. However, others might not share that understanding and could perceive it as endorsing violence against modern groups. The author's friends sided with them, but the critic's point is valid in that the phrase could be seen as a call to action if taken out of historical context.\n\nConsidering that the sticker is on a functional gun (even if historical), and the phrase's dual meaning, it's possible the author is in a gray area. But since the author's intent is historical and the sticker is removable, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if the sticker could reasonably offend someone by implying current violent intent, maybe they are. \n\nI think the key is that the author didn't mean harm, but the sticker's placement on a gun might amplify the perceived threat. However, given the historical context and the origin of the phrase, it's also a legitimate reference. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong since the intent is historical, but there's a valid argument on both sides. The fact that friends supported them suggests others see it as a historical nod rather than an offensive statement now.\n"
