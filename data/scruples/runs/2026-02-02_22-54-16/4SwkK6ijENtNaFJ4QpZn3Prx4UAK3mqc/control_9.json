Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The situation involves a discussion with friends and someone else at the range who found the sticker offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is a history enthusiast with a collection of historical guns. The Mosin Nagant in question is from WWII, and the sticker references the original WWII-era slogan. The user argues that the phrase is historically accurate since the rifle might have been used in that context. They also mention that the sticker is removable and they own an unmodified version as well.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker compared it to using similar phrases for modern ideologies, implying it could be seen as threatening. The user counters by pointing out the historical origin of the phrase and that they don't use it in a modern political sense. Friends sided with them, but the user is uncertain.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I have to weigh the intent versus the impact. The user's intention was to reference historical context, not to make a modern statement. However, the sticker was perceived as offensive because it could be interpreted as threatening or insensitive. The key here is whether the user's actions, despite their intent, caused harm or offense.\n\nThe phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference, but attaching it to a modern firearm might lead some to associate it with current political tensions. Even if the user doesn't intend that, the perception matters. The critic's argument is that it's not different from using similar phrases for other ideologies, which could imply a willingness to use the gun against people today. The user's defense is that the phrase is from WWII and the rifle is just for shooting paper, not people.\n\nIn similar debates, intent is important, but so is the context in which symbols are used. The user is in a community where firearms are present, so even a historical reference could be seen as provocative. However, the user is using it in a historical appreciation context, not as a threat. The fact that the sticker is removable and that they own an unmodified version shows they're aware of the antique's value and aren't altering it permanently.\n\nThe friends' support suggests that the user's community understands the historical context. Still, the critic's point is valid in that symbols can be misinterpreted. The user might not be in the wrong because their intent is historical, but there's a case that they should be sensitive to how others might interpret it. However, since the user never used it in a modern political context and it's a historical reference, the blame isn't entirely on them. It's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merit.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the intent was historical and there's no evidence of malicious intent. The user made an effort to use a historical reference and took steps to preserve the gun's originality. The offense taken is understandable, but the user isn't in the wrong for expressing their historical interest in this way.\n"
