Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant, a WWII-era rifle. They explain that the phrase comes from WWII, like the song \"This Land is Your Land,\" and that the gun might have actually been used against Nazis.\n\nThe person who confronted them said the sticker is insensitive and could imply using the gun to kill people now, comparing it to other ideological slanders. The user argues it's historical and not meant for modern politics. Their friends sided with them, but they're unsure.\n\nHmm. The key points are about context and intent. The user's intent was historical, referencing WWII, and they mention the sticker can be removed. The other person's issue is that the phrase might be misinterpreted as supporting modern political stances or being offensive. \n\nBut the original phrase is from the 40s and was used as a protest against fascism then. The user is using it in the same context, with a historical weapon. The comparison to other ideologies is a stretch because the original phrase is specific to Nazis. Also, the user clarifies they don't mean modern groups, just actual fascists from history.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Probably not. The sticker's context is historical, and the user's explanation makes that clear. The other person's discomfort might be about how symbols are perceived today, but the user's intent wasn't to offend. Since the sticker's message is tied to its historical origin and the user isn't using it to justify violence against others now, they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
