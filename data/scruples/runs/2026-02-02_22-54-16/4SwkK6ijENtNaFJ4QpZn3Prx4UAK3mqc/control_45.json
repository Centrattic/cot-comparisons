Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the sticker, the historical reference, and the reaction from someone else.\n\nFirst, the sticker's origin is during WWII, tied to Billie Holiday's song and the civil rights movement. But the person is using it on a WWII-era rifle, referencing its possible historical role in fighting Nazis. They argue that the phrase isn't meant for modern politics but the original context. However, the other person found it offensive, thinking it implies the user would use the rifle to harm people today. \n\nThe user's friends supported them, but the user is unsure. The main issue is whether the sticker's use is insensitive. The user's intention is historical, but others might interpret it differently, especially considering the modern political use of \"fascist\" as a slur. Even if the user didn't mean it that way, the sticker could be seen as trivializing historical violence or making a political statement they don't intend. \n\nThe answer hinges on intent versus perception. If the user's friends understood the historical reference, maybe the issue is more about differing opinions. But if others find it offensive regardless of intent, the user might be in the wrong. However, since the user's explanation is clear and they're not using it for current political statements, it's a gray area. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer is B (No), as the user's intent is historical and the sticker can be removed. The conflict stems from differing interpretations, not malicious intent. So, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
