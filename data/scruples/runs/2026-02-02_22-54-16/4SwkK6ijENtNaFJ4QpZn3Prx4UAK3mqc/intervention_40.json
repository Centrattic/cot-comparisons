Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the sticker, the history of the gun, and the reactions from others.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have a strong interest in history and that the sticker is a reference to the original WWII-era quote by Pete Seeger. The gun itself is a historical piece from the same period, so the connection to WWII context is clear. The argument is that the sticker is a nod to historical events, not a modern political statement. Also, the author clarifies that the sticker is removable and they have an unmodified version of the same gun, which shows they respect historical accuracy.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker argued it could imply using the gun against others today. But the author responds by pointing out the historical context and the original intent of the phrase. Friends supported the author, suggesting the criticism might be taken out of context. The author's intention was historical appreciation, not promoting violence against any group now.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action seems to be a historical reference rather than an offensive statement. They didn't intend to trivialize the original quote's context or imply current use against people. The criticism might stem from a misunderstanding of the historical reference. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
