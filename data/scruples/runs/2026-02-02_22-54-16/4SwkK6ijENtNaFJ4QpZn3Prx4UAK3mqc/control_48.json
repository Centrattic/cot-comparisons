Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical gun is in the wrong. The context is that the gun is a Mosin Nagant from WWII, and the sticker is a reference to a historical quote from the 1940s. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the background of the quote. \"This machine kills fascists\" was a slogan created by Woody Guthrie in 1940 for a government campaign during WWII. It was meant to promote the sale of war bonds and support the Allied cause against fascism. The original context was very specific to WWII and the fight against Nazi Germany and Axis powers.\n\nThe person in question is using this sticker on a rifle that was actually produced during WWII, possibly used by Soviet forces. They argue that the rifle might have been used to kill fascists in the past, and now it's just for target shooting. They mention that the sticker is easily removable and that they have an unmodified version of the same rifle. Their friends side with them, but someone at the shooting range found it offensive, suggesting that the sticker could be interpreted as implying the person would use it to kill people in the present day.\n\nNow, the key points here are the historical reference and the interpretation of the sticker in a modern context. The user is trying to connect the historical use of the phrase with their own use on a historically significant gun. However, the person who confronted them argues that the phrase could be seen as justifying violence against modern groups if the wording is twisted. \n\nBut considering the original intent and historical accuracy, the phrase is tied to WWII. The user didn't intend to reference modern politics. However, the issue here is whether others can still take offense even if the intent is historical. The person who found it offensive did acknowledge the historical aspect but still felt the implication was that the user might use the gun to kill others now. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, using historical references can be context-dependent. If the user clearly intended it as a historical nod and not as a modern political statement, then their intent is one factor. However, the presence of the sticker on a functional weapon might still be problematic for some people regardless of intent. The line between historical reference and potential encouragement of violence is thin here. \n\nBut considering that the user is aware of the history and is using it in a way that aligns with its original context, and they're not promoting violence in the present, it's more of a misunderstanding. The person who took offense might be overreaching by equating it to modern uses, which the user didn't intend. Additionally, the user has another unmodified gun, showing they don't need the sticker for function.\n\nSo, taking all that into account, the answer would be that the user isn't in the wrong because their intent was historical and they didn't mean to offend. The other person's interpretation might be a stretch given the historical context. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
