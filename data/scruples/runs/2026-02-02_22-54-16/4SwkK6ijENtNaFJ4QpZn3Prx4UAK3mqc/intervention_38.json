Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person with a Mosin Nagant rifle from WWII who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on it. The controversy comes when someone else finds the sticker offensive because they think it implies the author would use it to kill people now, which the author clarifies isn't the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The original quote \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was from a WWII poster, so the author is referencing historical context. They mention that the rifle was from WWII and that the phrase was coined by someone who also wrote \"My Land is Your Land,\" which is a song by Woody Guthrie. The author's intent is to connect the rifle's history during WWII with the sticker, not to make a modern political statement. They also point out that the sticker is removable and that they own another unmodified version of the same rifle.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker argued that it's offensive because it could imply the author uses the rifle to kill people now, even though the author says it's for historical reference. The author argues that the phrase is from WWII and not a modern statement. Their friends supported them, but the author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the factors. The key points are intent vs. perception. The author's intent is historical and educational, and they've made that clear. However, the sticker could be perceived by others as a political statement or as trivializing the gravity of killing, especially in today's climate where terms like \"fascist\" are used in various contexts. Even though the author's intention is historical, the sticker's message might be misinterpreted or cause discomfort to those who associate it with current issues.\n\nBut the author is also using historical accuracy to justify the sticker. The Mosin Nagant was indeed used during WWII, and the phrase was used in the same era. The fact that the sticker is removable adds that it's not a permanent modification, which might be a point in their favor.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that using a weapon, even historically, with a phrase that's been co-opted into modern political discourse could be seen as insensitive, regardless of the original context. The critic's point is that the sticker could imply the author is okay with using the weapon to kill people, which the author denies.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wrongness is based on intent, then the author isn't in the wrong because their intent was educational. But if it's based on the potential for causing offense, even unintentionally, then there's a case that the author could be considered in the wrong. However, given the historical context and the author's explanation, it seems like the criticism is more about differing opinions rather than a clear case of wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because their intent was historical and educational, and they provided context. The misunderstanding comes from different perspectives on historical vs. modern interpretations, not malicious intent.\n"
