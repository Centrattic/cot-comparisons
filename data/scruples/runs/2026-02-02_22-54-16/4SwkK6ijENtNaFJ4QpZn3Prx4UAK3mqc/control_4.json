Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The situation involves some debate with a friend about the appropriateness of the sticker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest, particularly in WWII-era firearms. They have a Mosin Nagant from WWII and added a sticker that references a historical quote from Pete Seeger, which was associated with the WWII era. The friend found the sticker offensive, arguing it could imply the author would use the gun against modern ideologies, while the author explains it's a nod to its historical context.\n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the sticker, the historical context of the quote, and the perception of others. The author clearly states they meant it to reference WWII history, not modern politics. The sticker is removable and on a replica or similar gun, not the original. Their friends supported them, but the author is unsure.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether the sticker is insensitive. The original quote is from the 40s, tied to the fight against Nazis. Using it on a weapon from that era could be seen as a historical reference. However, in modern times, the term \"fascist\" can have broader political connotations, which might lead to misunderstandings. The friend's concern is that the sticker could be interpreted as advocating violence towards a modern group, which the author didn't intend.\n\nBut the author's intent is clear and historical. They didn't mean to imply current political use. The fact that the sticker is on a historical replica and used for shooting paper targets supports that. The friend's comparison to using other ideologies might not be fair since the quote has a specific historical origin. The author also has another unmodified gun, so it's not altering the artifact's historical value.\n\nIn terms of social appropriateness, it's possible that some might find the sticker jarring or insensitive if they don't understand the historical reference. But the author didn't intend to offend, and the context of their hobby is about history and safety. Since they clarified their intent and the sticker is a temporary addition, it's debatable whether they're in the wrong. The answer likely depends on whose perspective you take, but given the author's explanation and the historical context, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
