Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The author explains that the rifle is a WWII-era historical piece, and they put the sticker as a joke referencing the original quote from the 1940s, which was used by the US military. They argue that the sticker refers to the rifle's historical context rather than implying any modern intent. The person who confronted them thought it was offensive, suggesting it could imply the author would use the gun to kill people today, similar to other ideological groups.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the original quote. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was indeed a WWII-era slogan, used to promote the sale of war bonds and to support the Allied cause. The author is using it in reference to the rifle's possible role during that time. However, modern interpretations might vary. The person who objected felt it was insensitive, possibly because using a phrase associated with WWII in conjunction with a firearm today could be seen as trivializing the historical context or making a political statement.\n\nThe author's intention is key here. They mention they're not referring to modern politics but the historical aspect. Yet, when a sticker like that is placed on a gun, especially in a public setting like a shooting range, interpretations can differ. The person who objected felt it implied current intent, which the author denies. The friends supported the author, indicating that not everyone sees it the same way.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the item. The Mosin Nagant is a historical weapon, and the author has another unmodified one. The sticker is removable and not permanent. This might mitigate claims of irreverence towards the artifact. However, the use of a slogan from a specific historical conflict on a weapon, even with good intentions, could be seen as sensitive, especially given current political climates where terms like \"fascist\" are sometimes used in modern ideological debates.\n\nThe argument that it's a joke or a historical reference might not be universally accepted. The person who confronted the author might not be aware of the historical background of the slogan and could interpret it as endorsing violence towards a modern group. This miscommunication could lead to the perception of insensitivity.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author likely didn't intend harm, but they might not have considered how others could take it. The question of whether they're in the wrong hinges on whether their action, despite good intentions, crosses a line by potentially causing offense. Since the sticker references a historical context but is on a modern gun, there's ambiguity. The author's defense is based on historical accuracy, but the other person's concern is about the potential misinterpretation.\n\nIn similar situations, intent is important, but so is the impact. If the impact causes someone else to feel uncomfortable or offended, even if unintentionally, there's a case to be made that the author didn't consider all perspectives. However, if the majority of their peers (the friends) side with them and see it as a historical nod, that supports the author's position. Yet, the fact that someone found it offensive suggests there's a valid reason to reconsider, even if the author didn't mean it that way.\n\nSo, weighing intent against impact, and considering the potential for misunderstanding in a public space, the author might be in a gray area. However, since the sticker is removable and the author's intention is clear in their own mind, but the reaction of others shows that it's not universally accepted, the answer could lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but perhaps being careless with how others might perceive it. But given the options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong), the better answer is B because the author's intent is historical and the sticker is temporary, but there's a case for A because of the potential offensive impact. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong and the friends agree, B seems more correct.\n"
