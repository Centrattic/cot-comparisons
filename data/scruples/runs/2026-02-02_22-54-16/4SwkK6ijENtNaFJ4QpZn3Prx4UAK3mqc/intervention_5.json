Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for putting the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is into historical firearms, specifically a WWII Russian rifle. They applied a historical quote from WWII times on their gun. The sticker can be removed easily, and they have another unmodified version of the same gun. The person they spoke to at the range found it offensive, comparing it to using the same phrase for modern ideologies. The author argues that the quote is from WWII and refers to the rifle's possible past use, not modern politics.\n\nThe key points here are the historical context of the phrase, the intent of the author, and the nature of the object (a historical gun used for target practice). The phrase itself is a real quote from WWII, used by a union leader. The author's use is to connect the rifle's historical role in WWII with the original meaning of the phrase. The sticker is removable and not permanent, showing consideration for the gun's authenticity. \n\nThe person who criticized it made a comparison to modern contexts, but the author's intent wasn't about current politics. The friends sided with the author, and the author feels the criticism is misplaced. The main question is whether using a historical reference on a historical object is insensitive now. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's use seems to be in line with the historical context, and they didn't intend to promote modern political statements. The criticism might be based on a misunderstanding of the historical reference. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
