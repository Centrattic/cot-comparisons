Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their old Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the sticker, the gun's history, and the reactions from others.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the Mosin Nagant was made during WWII in Russia. The sticker references the famous WWII-era slogan from Billie Holiday's song \"Strange Fruit\" and the associated propaganda. The user argues that the sticker is a historical reference to the rifle's possible past use in fighting Nazis, not a modern political statement. They also note that the sticker is removable and they have an unmodified version of the same gun.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker felt it implied the user would use the gun to kill others now, which the user denies. The user points out that the slogan is from WWII and not a modern creation, and their friends supported them. However, the user is questioning if they might have been insensitive.\n\nNow, considering the context, the main issue is whether the sticker's historical reference is offensive. The user didn't intend to imply current intentions to harm others, but the critic interpreted it that way. The slogan \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is historically tied to WWII, and the gun's history in the same period supports the user's argument. However, in today's climate, any reference to \"killing\" might be seen as problematic, especially with guns involved. Even if the intent is historical, others might not see the distinction and could feel threatened or find it insensitive due to modern associations with violence.\n\nThe user's friends sided with them, which suggests some social validation, but that doesn't necessarily mean the sticker is not offensive to others. The key is intent versus perception. The user's intent was historical, but the sticker's message can be perceived differently by others, especially in the context of gun ownership. Whether the user is in the wrong depends on whether the context of the historical reference is clear. Since the user explained the historical aspect, maybe the misunderstanding arises from others not connecting the dots. However, in a public setting like a shooting range, it's possible that not everyone is aware of the historical context, leading to unintended offense.\n\nThe user might not be in the wrong because the sticker is a historical reference and not a modern threat, but there's a case to be made that the phrase itself, regardless of context, could be seen as promoting violence. The key here is balancing historical appreciation with sensitivity to others' potential discomfort with any mention of killing in the context of firearms. Since the user's explanation clarifies the historical intent, and given that the sticker is removable and not permanent, it might lean towards the user not being in the wrong. However, the fact that someone felt offended suggests that there's a reason for sensitivity, which the user should consider even if they don't share the perspective. The answer hinges on whether the user's explanation mitigates the potential insensitivity. If the user's intent is clear and historical, then they are not in the wrong. If the public display of such a sticker can reasonably be seen as insensitive regardless of intent, then they might be. Given the information, the user's position is defensible, so the answer is B.\n"
