Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a gun with a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker. The user is asking if they're at fault for the sticker being called insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is into historical firearms, specifically a Mosin Nagant from WWII. They put a WWII-era quote on the gun, which was originally used during that time. The sticker is a historical reference, not a modern one, according to the author. The person who confronted them argued that the sticker implies the author uses the gun to kill people in the modern context, which the author disagrees with. The author's friends supported them, but they're still unsure.\n\nSo, the key points are: historical context, the origin of the quote, and the intent behind the sticker. The original quote was from WWII, so using it on a gun from that period might be seen as a historical nod. However, in today's context, \"fascists\" can have political connotations, which might make some people uncomfortable. The other person's argument is that the sticker could be interpreted as using the gun for violent purposes now, even if the author didn't intend that.\n\nThe author argues that the sticker is a historical reference and that the gun is used for target practice, not violent intent. They also mention that Mosin Nagants are common and unmodified. The sticker is easy to remove, which might mitigate some concerns. The other person's comparison to other ideologies or groups seems to be a stretch, as the author didn't make that parallel. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intent is clearly historical, not to promote violence against current groups. On the other hand, the sticker might still be misinterpreted, especially in a modern setting where the term \"fascist\" is politically charged. The author isn't in the wrong if their intent was genuine and respectful of history, but they might not have considered the modern implications. However, since they didn't intend any offense and the context is historical, I think they're not in the wrong. The other person's reaction is subjective, and the author isn't obligated to change their expression unless it's causing direct harm or violating laws. So I lean towards B (not in the wrong), but maybe with some nuance.\n"
