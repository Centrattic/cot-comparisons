Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on a historical Mosin Nagant rifle. The user is being accused of insensitivity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is into historical guns and uses them at the shooting range. The Mosin Nagant in question is from WWII, so it's an old weapon. The sticker references a WWII-era slogan from Woody Guthrie, used during the war to promote a specific cause. The author's intention is to connect the rifle's historical role in WWII to the original context of the slogan. \n\nThe person who criticized the sticker found it offensive because they thought it implied the author might use the rifle to kill people now, even though the author explains it's about historical context. The author argues that the phrase is from the same era as the gun and that the comparison to modern ideologies is not intended.\n\nNow, the key points are: \n1. The sticker's historical context vs. potential modern interpretations.\n2. The weapon being historical and modified with a removable sticker.\n3. The author's intent versus the other person's interpretation.\n\nIn the US, the culture of gun ownership is pretty strong, and historical reenactments or using historical items for educational purposes are common. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a classic example of wartime propaganda. The author is using it in a way that aligns with the original intent, not as a modern political statement. \n\nHowever, the criticism is that the sticker could be seen as trivializing the phrase or implying violent intent. But given that the author explains the historical connection and the gun is used for shooting paper targets, not people, the context is clear. Also, the author has an unmodified version of the same rifle, showing they respect the original. \n\nThe friends sided with the author, which suggests that the social context isn't hostile. The main issue is the other person's interpretation, which the author addressed by explaining the historical reference. The author isn't promoting violence; they're engaging in a hobby and honoring the history. \n\nI think the author's intentions are clear, and the sticker is used in good faith. The criticism is based on a misunderstanding or a different interpretation, but the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
