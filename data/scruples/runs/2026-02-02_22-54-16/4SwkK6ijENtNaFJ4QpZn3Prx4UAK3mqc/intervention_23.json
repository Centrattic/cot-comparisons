Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The person is into historical guns and uses the sticker as a nod to WWII history. The main issue is whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference from WWII, as mentioned. The rifle itself was made during that era, so the sticker is a direct connection to that period. The author clarifies that it's a joke and not a modern political statement, and they acknowledge the historical context. The person who confronted them argued it could imply using the gun to kill people today, but the author's intent was clearly historical.\n\nNext, the response from the critic. They compared it to modern ideologies, but the author counters that the phrase is from the same era as the rifle. The friends sided with the author, and the author is reflecting on whether it's trashy but not necessarily wrong. The key here is intent vs. perception. The author's intent was historical and respectful, but others might misinterpret it, especially if they're unaware of the historical reference.\n\nIn terms of wrongness, the author didn't intend to be offensive. They provided historical context, the sticker is temporary, and they have another unmodified gun. The criticism is about potential insensitivity, but without the author's intent being malicious, it's a matter of differing opinions. The AITA format usually looks at intent and harm. Since there's no harm done and the intent is clear, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
