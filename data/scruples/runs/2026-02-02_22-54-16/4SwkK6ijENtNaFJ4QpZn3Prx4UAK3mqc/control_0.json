Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle. The context is that the rifle is from WWII, and the author is using the sticker in reference to its historical use against Nazis. The person who confronted them argued that the sticker implies they'd use it to kill people now, which the author disagrees with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author clearly states their intention is historical and not related to modern politics. They mention the sticker's origin during WWII and the context of the rifle's manufacture during that time. The phrase itself is a historical reference to Woody Guthrie, so the author is using it in its original sense.\n\nHowever, the other person found it offensive because they perceived it as implying current intent to harm others. The key here is whether the author's use is insensitive. The author argues that it's a historical reference, but others might see it as trivializing violence or making a political statement. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, intent matters, but so does the effect on others. Even if the author didn't mean to offend, the sticker could still be seen as insensitive if it causes discomfort. However, the author is using it in a historical context, not as a modern political slogan. The fact that the gun is used for target shooting and the author's explanation about its historical use suggests their intent is respectful.\n\nBut there's a counterargument: using a weapon with such a sticker might be seen as glorifying violence, even if historically. However, the author is not engaging in hate speech or promoting current violence. They acknowledge the history and have another unmodified gun, showing they respect the original as well.\n\nThe friends sided with the author, indicating that the social context isn't entirely against them. The person who confronted them made a comparison to using the phrase for other groups, which the author rightly points out is a flawed analogy because the original quote was specific to WWII.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's use is a historical reference without malicious intent. While some might find it offensive, the author isn't in the wrong since their purpose is educational and historical, and they didn't intend to offend. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
