Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The person explains that the rifle is a WWII-era historical gun, and the sticker is a reference to the original WWII context. They argue that the rifle is just for shooting at the range and not for actual use, and that the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" comes from a WWII-era quote by Pete Seeger.\n\nThe person's friend criticized the sticker as offensive, comparing it to using the phrase to refer to modern ideologies. The user's friends support them, but they're still unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the sticker. The original phrase is a historical reference, so using it on a historical gun that was part of WWII makes sense. The person isn't using it in a modern political context but rather acknowledging the gun's possible historical role. Since the gun is a collectible and used for shooting at a range, the intention isn't to threaten anyone. The sticker is removable, and they have another unmodified gun, so they're not altering the historical piece permanently.\n\nThe friend's argument is that the sticker could be seen as implying the user would use the gun to kill people today, which seems a stretch given the context. The user clarifies they don't mean modern politics. The phrase's origin is tied to WWII, so using it in that historical context isn't inherently offensive. However, some might still take offense due to current political sensitivities. But the user's intent is historical appreciation, not political statement. \n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong because their use is respectful and rooted in history, not a modern threat. The answer should be B (No).\n"
