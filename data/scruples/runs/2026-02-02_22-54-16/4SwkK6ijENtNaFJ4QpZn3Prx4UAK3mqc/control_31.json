Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The situation is a bit nuanced, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest. They have a Mosin Nagant from WWII and put a sticker that's a historical reference. The quote \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was actually used during WWII, right? It's a historical piece, so the author is using it in the context of the rifle's own history. They mention that the gun might have been used in WWII, so the sticker is a nod to that era.\n\nThen, someone at the range called the sticker insensitive and offensive. The author argues that the phrase is from WWII, not a modern reference, and that the gun is just a historical artifact they use for shooting at the range. The friends side with them, but the author is unsure if it's trashy.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sticker's historical context, the gun's historical background, and the perception of the sticker by others. The person who complained thinks it implies the author might use it to kill people now, which the author denies. The main issue is whether the sticker is offensive or insensitive based on modern interpretations versus the historical intent.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sticker is a historical reference on a historical weapon. The author isn't using it in a way that supports violence now. The sticker isn't defacing the gun permanently. The person's objection is probably about the potential implication that they're using it for modern political reasons, but the author's intention is historical. Since the author is clear about the historical context and the sticker is removable, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The answer is likely B, No.\n"
