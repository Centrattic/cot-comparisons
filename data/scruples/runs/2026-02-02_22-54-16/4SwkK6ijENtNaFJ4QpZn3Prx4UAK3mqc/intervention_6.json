Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context and intent behind the sticker, as well as the potential offensiveness.\n\nFirst, the author explains that the rifle is a historical piece from WWII, and the sticker references the original WWII-era phrase. They mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified version of the same rifle. The person who confronted them felt it was insensitive, possibly implying that using such a phrase on a gun today could be seen as promoting violence against a modern group. The author argues that the phrase is tied to its historical context and that they're not linking it to contemporary politics.\n\nNow, considering intent versus perception. The author's intention is clearly historical and not to incite violence. However, symbols and phrases can take on new meanings over time. Even if the phrase originated from WWII, using it on a gun today might still make some people uncomfortable, especially given current discussions around gun violence and hate symbols. The person who complained might have felt that the sticker trivializes the original meaning or could be misinterpreted. But the author's explanation and the historical context are important factors here.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is aware of the historical significance and uses the gun for historical purposes (like shooting at a range) suggests that the sticker is more of a nod to the past. The comparison made by the other person to other ideologies being targeted is a stretch because the original phrase is specifically tied to WWII and Nazis, not a modern group. \n\nIn public settings like a shooting range, people's sensitivities can vary. While the author isn't in the wrong based on their intent and context, some might still find it offensive regardless. The responsibility here might lie more with the person who took offense, as the author was using it in good faith with historical context. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they didn't intend to offend and the sticker's historical reference, the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
