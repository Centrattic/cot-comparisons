Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario where someone put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The key points are the historical context and the reaction from someone else.\n\nFirst, the author explains that the rifle is a WWII-era Mosin Nagant from Tula. The sticker is a reference to a WWII-era slogan by Pete Seeger, intended to promote resistance against fascism. The author uses it humorously, acknowledging the rifle might have been used in that context historically. They also mention that the sticker is removable and they have another unmodified rifle, so there's no permanent alteration.\n\nThe person who found it offensive argues that it implies the author might use the gun to kill others now, comparing it to using the phrase against modern ideologies. The author counters that the phrase is historical and not meant to reference current politics.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are intent, context, and the potential for offense. The author's intent was historical and humorous, not to make a political statement. The phrase itself is tied to WWII, and the gun is a historical artifact. However, firearms and their symbolism can be sensitive. Even if the intent is clear, the sticker might still be seen as trivializing the weapon's past use or implying a current readiness to kill, which could be offensive regardless of intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't alter the gun permanently, was using it for historical reenactment purposes, and the friends supported them. The reaction is subjective, and the author didn't mean to offend. But the issue is whether the action itself is insensitive regardless of intent. Since the sticker is on a firearm, which is inherently a tool of death, some might find the phrasing jarring, even if it's historical.\n\nIt's a bit of a judgment call. If the author's intent was respectful and historical, maybe they're not wrong. But if the sticker could be misinterpreted or is seen as mocking the seriousness of the original slogan, then there's a case for being in the wrong. However, given the historical context and the author's explanation, the answer might lean towards them not being in the wrong since they didn't intend to cause offense and the sticker has a historical reference. Still, sensitivity to others' feelings is important. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just about sensitivity. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
