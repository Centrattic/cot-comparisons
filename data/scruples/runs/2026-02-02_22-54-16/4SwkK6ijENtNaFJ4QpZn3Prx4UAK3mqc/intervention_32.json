Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong for putting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the person is into guns and history, and the Mosin Nagant is a WWII-era Russian rifle. The sticker is a reference to the original quote from WWII, which was meant to highlight the role of the M1 Garand in defeating the Nazis. The author uses it humorously, noting the historical context of the rifle itself, which might have been used against fascists during the war. They also mention that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified rifle. Friends sided with them, but a stranger at the range found it offensive, arguing it implies the author would use the gun to kill people now, which the author denies, emphasizing it's about historical context.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, in the US, owning and modifying firearms (within certain limits) is legal. The sticker is a removable item, so it's not altering the weapon's functionality, just its appearance. Legally, they aren't violating any laws here.\n\nEthically and socially, the issue is more nuanced. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical meme, but modern interpretations can vary. Some people might see it as a pointed statement against current ideologies, even if the author's intent is purely historical. The stranger's concern is about the interpretation\u2014maybe they're conflating the historical reference with a modern one. The author argues that the context is clear (the gun is from WWII, the phrase is from that era), but others might not get that nuance.\n\nThe author's friends agreed with them, which suggests that within their group, the humor and historical reference are understood. However, the stranger felt it was insensitive, which might depend on the location and the current political climate. In some areas, using terms like \"fascist\" today could be seen as a political statement, especially in the context of gun ownership. The comparison to other ideologies is a stretch, as the original phrase is specifically tied to WWII. But the stranger's point is that if it's a current statement, it could be offensive, implying violence against specific groups.\n\nI need to consider if the author's intent matters. They clearly state they didn't mean it as a modern political comment and that it's a historical nod. However, intent versus impact is often a point of contention in these situations. Even if the author didn't mean it offensively, the sticker could still be seen as promoting the idea of using a gun for violence, which some might interpret negatively regardless of historical context.\n\nAlso, the fact that the gun is historical and the phrase is from the same era might be a valid defense. The original quote was meant to frame the acceptance of the M1 Garand as a step towards victory, not to be a weapon's tagline. Applying it to a WWII rifle could be a humorous or ironic way to appreciate history, not necessarily a call for current action.\n\nBut guns are always sensitive. Even if the author has good intentions, the mere presence of such a slogan on a firearm could be alarming or offensive to some, especially when combined with the act of going to a shooting range. The stranger's reaction, while brief, indicates that some people might not make the historical distinction and could take it the wrong way.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the question is about whether they intended to be offensive, the answer is likely no. But in terms of how others perceive it, maybe. The key here is whether the author's use of the sticker is considered insensitive, regardless of intent. If the sticker is seen as trivializing the historical use of weapons or implying a willingness to kill people in the present, then some might say they are in the wrong. However, the author is using it as a historical reference and a joke, which others might see as harmless. \n\nThe answer hinges on the difference between intent and impact. Since the user asks if the author is \"in the wrong,\" and considering that the author didn't mean to offend and made it clear it's a historical reference, I'd lean towards B (No). The stranger might have a valid concern about the message, but the author's actions don't seem malicious. It's a matter of differing opinions and sensitivity, not necessarily a right or wrong scenario. The author isn't breaking laws or being deliberately offensive, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
