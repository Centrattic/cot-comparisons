Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the person's reasoning: they like guns and history, the rifle is from WWII made by Tula. They put the sticker as a joke, referencing the historical context where the phrase was used during the war, like with the song \"This Land is Your Land\" by Woody Guthrie, who also coined the \"This Machine...\" slogan. They mention the sticker is removable, and they have another unmodified rifle. Their friends supported them, but the user feels conflicted.\n\nThe main issue here is whether using that sticker on a WWII-era gun is insensitive or offensive. The person argues it's historical, not a modern statement. The person who criticized them compared it to using similar phrases targeting other groups, implying it could be seen as promoting violence against current ideologies or groups. \n\nNow, I need to consider the context. The original phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was a WWII-era slogan, used in a specific historical and political context. The user is using it in reference to the same context, not modern politics. The sticker is on a gun that's part of historical reenactment or collection. They don't use it to imply current intentions to harm, just a nod to past events. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Even if it's historical, the phrase can be interpreted as endorsing violence against current groups labeled as fascists. Some people might see it as trivializing the Holocaust by using a historical reference in a casual way. Also, guns are often associated with violence, so even a historical context might not fully negate the potential for the sticker to be seen as promoting violence. \n\nBut on the other hand, the user is being transparent about the historical context, using it in a way that's educational or humorous. The fact that the sticker is removable and they have an unmodified version suggests they respect the history but also use it as a hobby. Their friends don't find it offensive, which might indicate that among similar enthusiasts, it's acceptable. \n\nI should also consider the original intent. The phrase was a real slogan from the time the rifle was used. The user isn't changing the history but is referencing it. The critic's comparison to modern ideologies might be a stretch unless the user is explicitly making a modern political statement. \n\nAnother angle: the user's hobby is shooting historical guns, so the sticker is part of that theme. The key is whether the user is using it in a way that's respectful and true to its historical context. If they're not implying any current-day violence or promoting harmful ideologies, then maybe it's not the author's fault. \n\nBut wait, the critic might be under the impression that the phrase is being used out of context. The user should be aware that even though they see it as historical, others might misinterpret it. However, the user clarified that they were referring to the historical context, not modern applications. \n\nSo, the decision hinges on whether the user's use is genuinely historical and not meant to endorse violence today. If that's the case, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the sticker could be misinterpreted and the user didn't consider that, maybe they are. However, the problem states that the user explained their reasoning and friends supported them. The critic's argument may not hold if the user's intent is clear and non-malicious.\n"
