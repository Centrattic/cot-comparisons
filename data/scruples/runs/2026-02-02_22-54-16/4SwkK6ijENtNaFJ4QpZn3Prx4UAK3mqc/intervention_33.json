Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their gun. The author has a Mosin Nagant from WWII and put the sticker as a historical reference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is actually from WWII, created by Woody Guthrie, right? So the author is using a historical quote on a historical weapon. They mentioned they were being ironic and referencing the original context, not modern politics. \n\nThen there's the person who called it offensive. The argument there is that using the sticker might imply the author would use the gun to kill people now. But the author explains it's just a hobby, shooting at targets, not people. The friends sided with them too. \n\nThe author also noted the sticker is temporary and can be removed, and they have an unmodified version as well. The Mosin Nagant is common, so maybe the sticker isn't altering its historical value much. \n\nThe person who criticized it made a comparison to using the phrase for other ideologies, but the author points out the origin of the quote. The debate here is between historical accuracy vs. modern sensitivity. \n\nThe author's intention wasn't to be offensive. They were using a historical reference. Even though some might find it insensitive, the context and explanation seem to support their position. The friends agreed with them, so maybe the author isn't wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The key points are the historical context, the non-offensive intent, and the ability to remove the sticker. The critic's perspective is valid, but the author's use is within their rights given the circumstances.\n"
