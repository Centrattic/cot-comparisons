Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context: The Mosin Nagant is a WWII-era Russian rifle. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was coined by Woody Guthrie during WWII, referencing the M1 carbine. The person uses the sticker as a nod to the rifle's possible historical role in WWII, not implying current intentions. The sticker is removable and on a gun they use recreationally for shooting at a range, not for actual harm now.\n\nThe person argues that the phrase is historically accurate in context and not meant to be taken as a modern political statement. Their friends support them, and they clarify they have another unmodified gun. The person who criticized said it's offensive because it might imply using the gun to kill others now. \n\nNow, considering free speech and historical context, the phrase's original use was during WWII against Nazis. The author isn't promoting violence now but referencing history. However, the sticker's modern use could be seen as insensitive, especially given how \"fascist\" is sometimes used in current political discourse. But the user's intent is clear: to acknowledge the rifle's past, not to endorse present-day violence. Since they've explained their reasoning and the sticker is removable, it's more about personal expression within a historical context. The disagreement is subjective, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
