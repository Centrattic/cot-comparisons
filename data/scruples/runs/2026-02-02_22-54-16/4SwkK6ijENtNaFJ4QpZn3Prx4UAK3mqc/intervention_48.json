Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is at fault. The person argues that the rifle's history is tied to WWII when it might have been used against Nazis, and the sticker is a historical reference rather than a modern political statement. They mention that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified version of the same rifle. Their friend criticized the sticker as insensitive, saying it could imply the gun is used to kill people today, similar to other offensive labels.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was indeed a WWII slogan, used in propaganda, and was part of the historical narrative. The user is referencing that historical context, not modern politics. The rifle itself is a historical artifact from that era, so the sticker is a nod to its possible past use. The user clarifies they don't intend it as a modern political statement but as a historical one.\n\nHowever, the friend's objection is that the sticker could be misinterpreted as endorsing the use of the gun for killing others today. But the user's intention is clearly historical, and the rifle is used for target shooting, not actual harm. The user also points out that the original phrase was a song lyric and not a literal statement, which might support their argument.\n\nThe key here is intent versus perception. The user's intent is historical and not politically charged. The sticker is on a gun that's used for recreational shooting, not for violence. The friend's concern is about the potential misinterpretation, but the user's explanation suggests the sticker isn't meant to imply current use. Since the user is clear about their intent and the context is historical, it's more of a misunderstanding on the friend's part rather than the user being in the wrong. Also, the user has another unmodified gun, so the sticker isn't altering the historical piece in a significant way.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The sticker is a historical reference, not an endorsement of current violence. The friend's objection is based on a different interpretation, but the user's intent is clear and non-offensive.\n"
