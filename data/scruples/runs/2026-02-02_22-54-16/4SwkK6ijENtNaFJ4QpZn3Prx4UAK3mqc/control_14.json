Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sticker on their gun that says \"This Machine Kills Fascists.\" They have a historical connection to the Mosin Nagant rifle from WWII, and they put the sticker as a joke or reference to the historical context. The person argues that the sticker refers to the rifle's possible role in WWII, not implying they'd use it to kill people now. However, someone else found it offensive, suggesting it could be seen as justifying using the gun against others today.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent versus the perception. The author's intention was historical and non-offensive, referencing the original use during WWII. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" was used by Woody Guthrie during the war and was meant to highlight the role of weapons in fighting Nazis. The author is using it in that historical context.\n\nOn the other hand, the person who confronted them interpreted the sticker differently, possibly seeing it as a modern political statement, suggesting the author might use the gun to target people with certain ideologies. This could be seen as insensitive because it might trivialize the use of violence against groups, even if that's not the intention.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's use of the sticker crosses a line into being offensive. The author is aware that others might misinterpret it, but they believe their intention is clear. However, in public settings, especially with guns, symbols can be interpreted in various ways regardless of intent. The fact that the sticker could be seen as promoting violence against certain groups, even if historically, might make it problematic. The author might not be in the wrong if their intent is purely historical and they don't endorse the modern application, but others might still find it offensive. \n\nAlso, guns are sensitive items, and attaching any slogan to them can be problematic. The author's friends supported them, but the concern raised by the other person is valid. The comparison to using the phrase for other ideologies highlights that the sticker's message is ambiguous. Even if it's historical, the modern context might blur that line. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the intent is historical and non-violent, but the sticker can be interpreted as endorsing violence, then maybe they are not in the wrong because intent matters. However, the potential for misinterpretation and the sensitivity around guns and political statements might mean the author should reconsider. But the answer here is to choose A or B. Since the author's intention is historical and not to endorse modern violence, and they have a clear understanding of the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the other person's perspective is valid, so there's a case for A. But since the question is from the author's point of view, and they are asking if they are at fault, maybe the answer leans towards B because their intent was not malicious, but it's a bit of a tricky call.\n"
