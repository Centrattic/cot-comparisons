Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant, a WWII-era rifle. They explain that the phrase was from the 1940s and used during that time, so they're using it in a historical context. The other person at the range found it offensive, arguing it implies they'd use the gun to kill others today. The friends supported the author.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the historical reference versus the modern interpretation. The phrase itself has a specific historical origin, so using it on a gun that actually might have been used in that context could be seen as a nod to history. But the other person is taking it as a threat or a modern statement, which the author didn't intend. The author emphasizes that the sticker is removable and that they're not using the gun for anything but target practice now.\n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. If the author's intent was purely historical and not to make a political statement, then they might not be in the wrong. However, the phrase can carry modern connotations, especially with the rise of online humor and meme culture where such phrases are sometimes used differently. But the original context is clear. The other person's reaction is based on their interpretation, which could be valid, but the author's explanation of intent is also there. The friends agreed with the author, suggesting that maybe the other person is overreacting. But does that mean the author is right? \n\nAlso, considering that the gun is historical and the sticker is removable, there's no permanent alteration. The author seems to be aware of the history and is using it respectfully. The other person's comparison to using the same phrase for any modern group might not hold, since the original phrase was specific to WWII. The author isn't promoting violence against a current group, just referencing past events. So I lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They made a joke with historical context, and while someone may find it offensive, the intent was clear and not malicious.\n"
