Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The key points here are the context, intent, and the reaction from others.\n\nFirst, the author explains that the sticker is a reference to a WWII-era quote from Woody Guthrie. The gun itself is a historical piece, made in Tula during the war. The intent seems to be to connect the rifle's historical context with the original meaning of the slogan, which was anti-fascist during WWII. The author isn't using it in a modern political sense but rather as a nod to history.\n\nThe person who found it offensive argued that it implies the author would use the gun to kill others today, which the author disputes. The author also mentions that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified version of the same gun. The friends supported the author, and the author themselves feel conflicted but not entirely in the wrong.\n\nConsidering that the phrase was a historical slogan, and the context is about historical use of the weapon, it's plausible the author isn't in the wrong. The issue arises from differing interpretations: the author sees it as historical homage, while others might see it as a call to violence today. But since the author's intent is clearly historical and not to endorse modern violence, the answer leans towards B.\n"
