Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The situation involves some historical context and opinions from others.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a gun enthusiast with a focus on historical firearms. The specific gun in question is a WWII-era Mosin Nagant from Russia. The sticker references the famous WWII slogan, which was coined by Woody Guthrie. The author's intention is to connect the rifle's potential role in WWII with the historical context of the slogan. \n\nThe person who confronted them at the range found the sticker offensive, arguing that it implies the author would use the gun to kill people now, perhaps in a modern political context. The author counters that the phrase is rooted in WWII and not meant to be taken in a modern sense, and that the sticker is removable and on an antique gun. They also mention having another unmodified version of the same rifle.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: intention vs. perception. The author's intent is historical homage, but the sticker might be perceived differently by others. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is indeed a historical reference, but in today's climate, where fascism is a contemporary political issue, using such a slogan could be seen as invoking a modern political stance. \n\nThe author argues that the gun is for historical shooting and not for offensive use now. However, the sticker's presence could be interpreted as a provocative statement, especially in a public setting like a shooting range. Even if the author didn't mean it, others might see it as a call to action or as trivializing historical violence.\n\nThe friends supported the author, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The judgment depends on whether the author should have considered the possible offense caused. Since the author acknowledges the sticker can be seen as trashy and feels conflicted, it's a gray area.\n\nIn terms of ethics, causing offense unintentionally doesn't necessarily make someone wrong, but if the potential for misunderstanding is high, removing the sticker could be considerate. However, the author's defense that it's a historical reference is valid. The answer might hinge on the principle of unintended offense versus the importance of historical context.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because their intent was historical and the sticker is removable. The comparison to modern uses might be misplaced. The person who objected might have misinterpreted the historical reference. The author isn't using the gun for violence now and is aware of the historical context. Therefore, the author isn't at fault.\n"
