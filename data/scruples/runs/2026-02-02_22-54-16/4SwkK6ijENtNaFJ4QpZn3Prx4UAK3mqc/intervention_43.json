Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who put the \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical gun is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the gun's history, the origin of the quote, and the reaction from someone else.\n\nFirst, the Mosin Nagant is a WWII-era rifle, so the quote \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is historically relevant because it was used during the war by the US military. The user mentions they have another unmodified gun, and this one is decorated with a sticker that's easily removable. They explain the sticker is a nod to the gun's potential role in WWII, not a modern political statement.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker argued it could imply using the gun against modern groups, but the user clarifies they never meant it that way. The friends sided with the user, and the user is seeking validation.\n\nNow, considering the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) context, the user is looking for whether their action was insensitive. The main factors here are intent vs. impact. The user's intent was historical, not to offend. The sticker's origin is tied to WWII, which is historical context. However, the sticker might be seen as insensitive if someone interprets it as supporting violence against modern groups, even if that's not the intent.\n\nBut the user is using historical accuracy as defense. The sticker is on a historical object, and the phrase itself is a historical reference. Since the user clarified their intent and the sticker is removable, it's a personal expression of historical interest. The critic's concern is valid but perhaps overreaching, as the phrase isn't used in a modern political context here. The user isn't promoting violence now but acknowledging the weapon's role in the past.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often split based on intent vs. perception. Here, the user's intent is clear and non-offensive, and the context is historical. The critic's interpretation is a stretch. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
