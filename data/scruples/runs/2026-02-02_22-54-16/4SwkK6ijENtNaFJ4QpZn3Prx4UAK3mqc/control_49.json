Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The main question is whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The Mosin Nagant was made during WWII in Russia, so it's historically tied to that period. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a reference to a quote from Woody Guthrie, which he used on his guitar to counter the \"This Machine Kills\" propaganda from the Nazis. The user is using this sticker on a historical rifle, which they themselves consider as part of their hobby and historical interest. The sticker is removable, and the user mentions they own another unmodified example of the same rifle.\n\nThe user's argument is that the phrase has historical context and isn't intended to be offensive. Their friend, however, found it offensive, interpreting it as implying the user would use the rifle to kill people in the modern context, which the user denies. The friends supported the user, so there's some social context there too.\n\nNow, to evaluate if the user is in the wrong. The key points are the historical reference, intent, and how others might perceive it. The phrase itself is a historical reference from WWII, which the user is using to mirror the rifle's possible past. Since the rifle is a historical item, the sticker could be seen as a nod to its past use. However, the modern interpretation might be different. The user's justification is that the rifle is now used for target practice, not harming people. \n\nBut the issue arises from how others perceive it. The person who found it offensive thought it implied the user would use the rifle to kill others, regardless of historical context. The user argues that the phrase is not a modern invention and is tied to WWII context. The user didn't intend to reference modern politics, but the sticker's message might be ambiguous to others. \n\nIs the user wrong for having the sticker? It's a matter of perspective. If the user's intent was purely historical and not to make a modern political statement, then maybe not. However, the sticker's placement on a functional firearm (even if for historical display) could be seen as insensitive because it might evoke negative connotations, especially in today's climate where discussions around guns and violence are sensitive. \n\nBut the user is also part of a community that appreciates historical firearms, and in that context, the sticker might be more understandable. The user also mentions that the rifle is modified in this case with a sticker, but there's an unmodified version. The fact that the sticker is removable suggests they are aware it might not be universally accepted. \n\nSo, there's a balance between personal expression, historical context, and others' sensitivities. The user didn't intend to be offensive, but the sticker could be misinterpreted. The friend's point is that using such a phrase on a gun could imply a willingness to use it lethally, which is a valid concern even if unintended. \n\nIn conclusion, the user might not be in the wrong because their intent was historical and the sticker is removable and not permanent. However, they might be negligent in considering how others could perceive it. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the answer requires a binary choice, I think the answer leans towards \"B\" (No), because intent and historical context are on their side, and they made efforts to clarify their meaning. The friend's offense is valid, but the user isn't necessarily wrong because they didn't intend harm.\n"
