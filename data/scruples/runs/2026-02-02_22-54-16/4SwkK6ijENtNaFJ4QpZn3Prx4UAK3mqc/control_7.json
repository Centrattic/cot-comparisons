Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. The situation involves a debate about the appropriateness of the sticker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the quote. The original phrase was used in the 1950s for a Superman comic, written by the same person who wrote \"My Land is Your Land,\" which was a protest song against McCarthyism. The user is using it on a WWII-era rifle, referencing its historical context. They argue that the rifle, made during WWII, might have been used to kill Nazis, hence the sticker. They mention that it's a historical reference and not meant for modern political statements.\n\nThe critic's argument is that the sticker could imply the user would use the rifle to kill people today, which is offensive. The user counters that the quote is historical and the rifle is now used for target shooting. Friends support the user, but they're unsure if they're being insensitive.\n\nI should consider the intent vs. impact. The user's intent was historical, but the sticker's message could be interpreted differently by others. The key here is whether the use of a historical phrase on a functional gun is offensive. Since the gun is part of a collection and used for target practice, the context is recreational, not violent. However, the phrase's association with a powerful historical period might overshadow the user's intent, leading some to find it inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that the rifle is a common model and they have another unmodified one. The sticker is removable, so it's not a permanent alteration. The comparison to modern political groups is a point of contention. The user argues against that comparison by linking the phrase's origin.\n\nIn terms of cultural sensitivity, the phrase \"kills fascists\" is tied to WWII, a time when such actions were part of a just war. However, using a weapon with that label might still be seen as trivializing the historical context by some. The user's friends agree with their stance, which suggests that the community around them finds it acceptable.\n\nUltimately, whether the user is in the wrong depends on perspective. The user's intent was historical and non-offensive, but the sticker's placement on a functional gun might cause discomfort for others. There's a balance between personal expression and considering others' sensitivities. Since the user didn't intend to cause offense and the context is historical, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). However, the user's awareness of possible interpretations shows they're not entirely dismissive of the concern.\n"
