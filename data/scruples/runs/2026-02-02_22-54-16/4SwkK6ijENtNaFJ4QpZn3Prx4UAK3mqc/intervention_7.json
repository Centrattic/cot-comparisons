Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical gun is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the sticker, the history behind it, and the reaction of others.\n\nFirst, the sticker's origin is important. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a historical reference from WWII, coined by someone associated with Woody Guthrie. The user is using it on a Mosin Nagant, a rifle from that era, which might have been used in the war. The user argues that the sticker is a nod to its possible historical use, not implying modern intentions. They also mention that the gun is a replica or another version, and the sticker is removable.\n\nThe conflict arises when someone else finds it offensive, suggesting it could imply the user wants to kill people now, especially if the phrase is taken out of context. However, the user clarifies they're not using it in the modern political sense, just referencing the historical context. Their friends support them, and they feel the comparison to other groups is unfair.\n\nI need to consider if the user's intent and the historical context justify the sticker. Since the phrase is historical and the user is using it in that context, not to promote violence or modern ideology, it's more of a historical reference. The person who criticized might be overreacting by not considering the historical background. Also, the user's explanation about the gun's history and the removable sticker supports their position. The friends siding with them also indicate that the community might see it as a harmless historical nod. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong because their intent is respectful and rooted in historical appreciation, not promoting violence today.\n"
