Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their historical Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They argue that the phrase is from WWII, and the gun itself might have been used in that context. The person put the sticker as a historical reference, not as a modern political statement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the phrase. \"This machine kills fascists\" was a slogan from the 1930s, associated with the Spanish Civil War and later WWII. The user is using it on a gun that's from WWII, made in Tula. So the connection to history is valid. They mention they have another unmodified version of the same gun, so it's not altering the historical artifact's value.\n\nThe complaint from the other person is that the sticker is insensitive because it might imply the user would use the gun to kill people today, which is a modern issue. The user counters that the phrase is historical and not meant for current political groups. The friends supported the user, but they're left wondering if they're wrong.\n\nI need to assess if the sticker is offensive. The phrase itself is a historical reference, but in today's context, using it on a functional gun might be seen as trivializing the original intent or making a political statement. However, the user's intention is purely historical, and they emphasize the historical context. The key points are the user's intent, the historical accuracy of the reference, and the potential for misinterpretation.\n\nSince the user is not promoting violence today and is using a historical artifact with a historical slogan, it's a matter of perspective. The person who found it offensive might be projecting modern issues onto a historical context. The user didn't intend to reference current politics, and the sticker is easily removable. So, the answer likely leans towards the user not being in the wrong, as their intent is historical and there's no evidence of malicious intent towards current groups.\n"
