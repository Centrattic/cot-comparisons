Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's context: they have a hobby of shooting historical guns, and the Mosin Nagant is from WWII. The sticker is a historical reference, right? The phrase was used in the 1940s by Pete Seeger on a banjo to support the war effort. The author mentions that they have another unmodified rifle and that the sticker is easy to remove. They also clarified that they were joking and the sticker relates to WWII history, not modern politics.\n\nThe person who criticized the author argued that the sticker could imply using the rifle to kill people in the present day, comparing it to other potentially offensive stickers. But the author's friends supported them. The main issue here seems to be about the interpretation of the sticker in a modern context versus its historical reference.\n\nI need to consider if using a historical slogan on a WWII-era gun is insensitive. Since the phrase itself is from WWII and the gun is from that period, the author is using it in the context it was originally intended. The key is whether the author's intent and the historical accuracy of the phrase matter, or if the sticker could be seen as inappropriate regardless. The author didn't use it to promote violence against any group today, they just made a historical joke. Also, the gun is for shooting at targets, not people.\n\nAnother angle: some people might find the phrase offensive because it's associated with a specific time and could be misinterpreted. But the author is clear that they're not referencing modern times. The response from the friend was about the implication of using the gun to kill others, but the author's explanation counters that by linking it to past history.\n\nIn cases like these, intent is a factor, but so is the potential for offense. However, since the author is using a historical reference on a historical item, and the sticker isn't promoting present-day violence, I think they aren't in the wrong. The comparison the friend made might be a stretch because other ideologies or groups aren't the same as the clear historical context of WWII fascists. The author also made it clear that the gun is used for target practice, not harming people. So the answer should be B.\n"
