Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The person explains that the rifle is a WWII-era Russian gun, and they put the sticker jokingly, referencing the historical context. They argue that the phrase isn't modern and was from the same time as the rifle, originally coined by Woody Guthrie.\n\nThe other person at the range found it insensitive or offensive, saying it implies the gun could be used to kill others now, similar to using any other ideology in the phrase. The author's friends supported them, but they're uncertain if they're being trashy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sticker is a historical reference. The Mosin Nagant was used during WWII, and the phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is associated with that era. The author isn't using it in a modern political context but rather acknowledging the gun's past role. They also mention that the sticker is removable and that they have another unmodified version of the same rifle, which shows they're aware of preservation issues.\n\nThe argument against the sticker is that it could be misinterpreted as a threat or as using a modern political slur. But the author's intent was clearly historical. The key here is intent versus perception. If the intent is purely educational or historical, then maybe not in the wrong. However, others might still find it offensive even if the intent is good. \n\nIn the US, owning and modifying firearms in a historical context is common, especially for collectors and enthusiasts. The phrase itself is a historical reference, not a modern one. The person who criticized it made a comparison to modern ideologies, but the original quote is from the 1940s. The author's explanation that the gun was part of the WWII context supports the historical aspect.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of public perception and the current political climate. The term \"fascist\" is often used in modern political discourse, so even if the author's intent is historical, others might interpret it as a jab at contemporary groups. However, the author explicitly states they never meant it to refer to the modern political climate, and the friends agreed with them.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is responsible for the sticker's potential misinterpretation. While they can't be blamed for the phrase's historical origin, they might be in a gray area if the sticker could be seen as insensitive to current events. But since the context is a historical gun from WWII and the sticker is a nod to that period, it's more of a historical reference than a direct threat.\n\nAlso, the fact that the sticker is easily removable and the author has an unmodified version suggests they respect the gun's history. The comparison made by the critic seems a bit off because the phrase is specifically tied to a historical anti-Nazi sentiment, not a modern one. So the author isn't in the wrong because their action was in line with the historical context and their intent was clear. The disagreement is subjective, and the author's actions don't cross into offensive territory if they're using it appropriately in the context of historical firearms.\n"
