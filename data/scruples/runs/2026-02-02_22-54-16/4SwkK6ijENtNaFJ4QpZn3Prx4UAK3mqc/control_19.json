Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant, a WWII-era rifle.\n\nFirst, the context: the person is into historical guns and has a Mosin Nagant from WWII. They put the sticker jokingly, referencing the historical context where that quote was used during WWII. The friend found it offensive, arguing it could imply modern use of the gun against others. The person argues it's a historical reference, not related to current politics.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus perception. The author intended it as a historical nod, but the friend interpreted it as insensitivity. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is a classic example from WWII propaganda, so there's a historical precedent. However, in today's climate, some might see it as trivializing past violence or even endorsing modern violence against groups labeled as \"fascists.\"\n\nBut the author also mentions that the gun is modified with a removable sticker and they have an unmodified one. They emphasize it's for historical interest, not use. The friends sided with them, but the author is conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether using a historical reference on a gun, which can be seen as a tool of violence, is insensitive regardless of intent. If someone else finds it offensive, even if the intent is historical, then maybe the author should reconsider. However, if the usage is clearly within a historical context and not meant to provoke, maybe not. The comparison the friend made about using it for other ideologies might be a stretch, but the sticker's placement on a gun could still be seen as problematic.\n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. The author's actions are not malicious, but the perception matters. The friend might be overreacting, but the author might also be insensitive to others' feelings. Since the answer is A or B, and given the nuances, it's possible the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the intent is historical and the context is clear. However, the sticker on a gun could still be seen as tasteless. The community might side with historical context, so maybe B is the answer.\n"
