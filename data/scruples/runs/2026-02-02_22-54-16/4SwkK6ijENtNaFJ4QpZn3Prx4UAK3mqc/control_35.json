Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. The context is that the rifle was made during WWII, and they put the sticker as a historical reference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the meaning of the phrase. The original quote from \"My Land is Your Land\" by Guthrie is a protest song, not a literal statement about guns. The user is using it to reference the historical role of the Mosin Nagant in WWII, where it was used against Nazis. So their intention is about honoring the past, not making a modern political statement.\n\nThe person who confronted them argued that the sticker could imply the user would use the gun now to kill others, even though the user clarifies it's for historical reasons. The user also mentions that it's a removable sticker and they have another unmodified version, so it's not like they're altering the gun's original state.\n\nI think the key here is intent versus perception. The user's intent is historical appreciation, but someone else might misinterpret it as a modern threat. However, the user is in a shooting range, which is a place where people enjoy firearms, so maybe the context is more about the hobby. The friends sided with them, suggesting that the community might understand the historical context.\n\nAlso, the user points out that the phrase isn't a modern invention and is tied to WWII. The Mosin Nagant was widely used during that time, so the sticker's connection to that era makes sense. The fact that they have another unmodified gun shows they don't need to alter it, but they chose to add the sticker for historical relevance, which is a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might find it insensitive because \"killing fascists\" can be a charged phrase today, especially in political discussions. However, the user never intended it to refer to modern issues. The comparison to other ideologies is a stretch, as the original phrase is specific to WWII context.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user's action is based on historical relevance and personal interest. While there's a possibility of misinterpretation, the user's explanation and the context of the shooting range as a historical hobby site mitigate that. The friends supported them, and the user is open to the idea that it's not a big deal. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
