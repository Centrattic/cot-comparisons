Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for having a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a historical interest in guns, particularly a Mosin Nagant from WWII. They put the sticker as a reference to the original WWII context, not the modern political climate. The person who complained felt it's insensitive or offensive, suggesting it implies the author would use the gun to kill people now. The author argues that the phrase is from WWII and that the rifle is now just for shooting targets.\n\nSo, the key points here are the intent, the historical reference, and the perception of others. The author's intent was to reference the historical context of the machine gun quote, which was used during WWII. They also mention that the gun is modified (with a removable sticker) and another unmodified version exists. The friends supported them, and the author didn't mean to reference modern politics.\n\nThe person who complained made a comparison to modern ideologies, which the author found a stretch. The author's stance is that the phrase is tied to the original historical event and not a contemporary statement. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. In the US, there's a strong tradition of Second Amendment rights, and using historical references on firearms might not be seen as inherently offensive. However, some might argue that even historical references can be sensitive, especially depending on the current political climate. But the author clearly states they didn't mean to imply modern usage against any group. The sticker is on a historical gun, and the context is clear to those familiar with the history.\n\nThe other person's objection might stem from a misunderstanding or a different interpretation. The author's explanation of the historical context seems valid. Since the author is not making a political statement with the sticker and is using it in a respectful, historical context, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The friends supported them, which suggests the situation is more about differing opinions rather than a clear wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
