Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle is in the wrong. They provided the context that the rifle is a WWII-era historical gun, and the sticker is a nod to the original WWII-era slogan. The person argues that the sticker is a historical reference and not meant to be offensive, especially since the rifle is used for target shooting and isn't a modern weapon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author used the sticker as a historical reference, not to make a political statement today. They mention that the phrase was from WWII and coined by the same person as \"Brother, My Land Is Your Land,\" which ties it to the historical context. The key here is whether the intent changes the perception of the sticker.\n\nNext, the reaction from the other person at the range. They found it offensive because it \"implies\" the author would use the gun to kill people now. But the author clarifies that the gun is used for shooting paper targets, not people. The other person's analogy to using the same phrase for other ideologies might be a stretch, as the original phrase is specifically tied to WWII and Nazis, not modern groups. However, the comparison might be made to highlight that using such a phrase could be seen as justifying violence against any group, which is a valid concern from a modern perspective.\n\nThe author also mentions that the sticker is removable and they have an unmodified version of the same rifle. This shows they aren't altering the historical item permanently, which could mitigate any criticism about preservation. The fact that the rifle is common and from a time when it was used in conflict might also support the idea that the sticker is a historical nod rather than an insensitive comment.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even historical references can be triggering or inappropriate in today's context, especially when associated with firearms. The term \"fascists\" has a clear negative connotation, and putting it on a weapon, even a historical one, might be seen as glorifying violence. However, the original use of the slogan was during WWII, a time when such rhetoric was common and aimed at defeating a real enemy. The author's context seems to align with that historical usage.\n\nThe friends supporting the author suggest that the community around guns and history might see the sticker as a legitimate homage. The disagreement between the author and the other person is more about interpretation than the author's intent. The author didn't intend to refer to modern political climate, and the sticker's historical origin is well-known.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the intent, historical context, and the fact that the sticker is temporary, the author isn't in the wrong. The other person's sensitivity is valid, but the author's use is in line with historical references and not meant to be offensive. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
