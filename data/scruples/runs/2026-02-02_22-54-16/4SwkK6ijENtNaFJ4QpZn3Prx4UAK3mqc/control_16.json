Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their WWII-era Mosin Nagant rifle is at fault for being insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user is a gun enthusiast with a historical interest. The rifle is a WWII-era Mosin Nagant from Tula. They put the sticker jokingly, referencing the original 1940s slogan used during WWII, which was a response to fascism. The user argues that the phrase is historical and not meant to reference modern politics. However, someone at the shooting range found it offensive, suggesting it implies using the gun to kill people today, possibly linking it to current ideologies. The user's friends supported them, but they're questioning their own choice.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the intent vs. the perception. The user's intent was historical and not to make a modern political statement. However, the sticker could be seen as trivializing a historical slogan by applying it to a personal weapon, even if it's an antique. The person who criticized it saw it as offensive because it might imply current intentions to use the gun against others, which the user is against. The user also mentions the historical context, but the perception matters here. \n\nIs using a historical quote on a personal item insensitive? It's a gray area. The user's usage is non-malicious, but the quote's origin is serious and related to real violence. Even if the user's intent is historical, others might find it insensitive to place such a statement on a weapon, regardless of its age or use. However, the user isn't using it in a modern political way, which complicates things. \n\nThe user also mentions that the sticker is removable and they have an unmodified gun. So, they're not altering the historical item permanently. The main issue is the perception by others. But does that make the user in the wrong? It's a matter of perspective. If the user didn't intend harm and the context is historical, maybe not. But if others find it offensive, there's a case that the user should consider their audience. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's intent is important, but the potential for others to find it offensive exists. However, since the user's explanation and friends support them, and there's no malicious intent, it's more of a misunderstanding. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the context is historical and the user's intentions are clear. However, the user might benefit from considering others' sensitivities in the future.\n"
