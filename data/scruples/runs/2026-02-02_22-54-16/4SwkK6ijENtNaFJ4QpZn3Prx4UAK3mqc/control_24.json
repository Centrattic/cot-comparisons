Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle, a WWII-era gun. They argue that the sticker is a historical reference since the original quote came from WWII and the rifle itself might have been used in that context. Someone else found it offensive, thinking it implies the person would use the gun to kill people today, especially with the modern political connotations of the phrase. The author didn't mean it that way but is wondering if they're being insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sticker is on a historical gun, and the phrase is from the same time period. The author explains they have another unmodified version of the same gun, so this isn't about altering the historical artifact. The sticker is removable, so it's not permanent. They also mention that the phrase was coined by the same person as \"This Land is Your Land,\" which is a left-leaning song, and they're using the historical context of the quote.\n\nNow, the person who criticized the sticker argued that it's similar to using the same phrase to kill any other group, implying modern-day violence. The author disagrees, saying the phrase is tied to WWII. The friends sided with the author, but they're unsure.\n\nThe key points here are intent and perception. The author's intent was to reference history, not to make a political statement or imply modern violence. However, the sticker's message could be misinterpreted by others. The phrase \"kills Fascists\" has a historical context, but in modern times, \"fascist\" is a term used in political discourse, so some might see it as a call to action or a justification for violence against those they consider fascists today. The author didn't intend that, but intent isn't the only factor in whether something is offensive.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, if the sticker is on a gun, even a historical one, the combination might be seen as insensitive, especially in a time where gun violence is a sensitive topic. Even if the author is a responsible gun owner, the sticker could be perceived as minimizing the lethality of firearms or trivializing the violence of the past. However, given that the author's explanation is about historical appreciation and that the sticker is removable, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is using a historical reference in a historical context. They're not using the gun for violence, just for shooting at the range. The criticism from the person might be a misunderstanding of the historical context. The friends agreeing with the author suggest that others might not see it as offensive. Still, the person who was offended does have a valid perspective if they interpret the sticker as condoning violence.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's hard to say. They didn't intend to be offensive, but the sticker could be seen as problematic. However, given the context of the historical gun and the historical origin of the phrase, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No), because the intent was historical and the sticker is removable, but there's a valid reason someone might find it offensive. The key is that intent matters, and the author didn't mean to imply using the gun for modern violence.\n"
