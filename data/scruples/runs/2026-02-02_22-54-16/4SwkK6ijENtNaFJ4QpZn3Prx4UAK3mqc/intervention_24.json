Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more \"historical\" guns that I have. \n\nDue to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first \"historical\" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a \"[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)\" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). \n\nThe other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting \"This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc).\" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote \"My Land is Your Land\"). \n\nWe agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who put a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker on their Mosin Nagant rifle from WWII is wrong. The main issue is whether the sticker is insensitive or offensive.\n\nFirst, the context: The rifle is historical, made during WWII, and the sticker references a phrase from the era. The author explains they have a passion for history and that the sticker is more about the historical context rather than a modern political statement. The sticker is on a replica or historical firearm used for shooting at a range, not for actual combat. They also mention that the sticker is removable and that they own another unmodified version of the rifle.\n\nThe person who criticized the sticker argued that it implies the author would use the gun to kill others now, comparing it to modern ideologies. But the author counters that the phrase is from WWII, not a modern context. Their friends support them, and the author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering free speech versus offense. The phrase itself is a historical reference, and the author is using it in a historical context. The sticker is on a gun used for target practice, not for actual aggression. The critic's point is about the implication of using the gun to kill people now, but the author clarifies that's not the intention. \n\nThe key points here are intent and context. The author's intent was historical homage, not to express a modern threat. The phrase \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" is tied to a specific time period and movement. Since the gun is used for historical purposes and not in a threatening manner, the use of the sticker seems a personal expression of their interest in history. The critic's interpretation might be a stretch unless the author was using it in a way that directly threatened others. \n\nAlso, given that the author is clear about the historical context and the sticker is easily removable, it's more about personal hobby than a public statement. So, the author isn't in the wrong because their intent was respectful to history, and the sticker's meaning is tied to the past, not modern aggression.\n"
