I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their 16-year-old daughter's relationship with the boyfriend's mother interfering. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent hasn't had issues before. Recently, the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, telling the daughter what to do, even arranging mental health appointments without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent feels this is toxic and breaks them up.\n\nThe key points here: The boyfriend's mom is overstepping boundaries, making decisions without the parent's input, and creating a toxic environment. The parent acts out of concern for their daughter's safety. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The actions of the boyfriend's mom might be manipulative, trying to replace the parent. The parent isn't acting out of jealousy but genuine concern for red flags.\n\nIn such cases, parents have the right to intervene if they believe their child is in a harmful situation. The boyfriend's mom's actions could be seen as undermining the parent and possibly exploiting the relationship. The parent's decision to break the relationship is a protective measure. So, the answer would be B (No, the parent is not in the wrong) because they're acting to protect their daughter from potential harm.\n"
