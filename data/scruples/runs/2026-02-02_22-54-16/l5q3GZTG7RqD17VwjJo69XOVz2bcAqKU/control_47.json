I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent breaking up their daughter's long-term relationship because of concerns about the boyfriend's mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17, and they've been dating for three years. The parent is worried about the boyfriend's mother acting like a mother figure, making decisions without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent decided to break them up due to safety concerns.\n\nI should consider the parent's role in protecting their child. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem intrusive and overstepping. She's taking control of her son's partner's mental health decisions without consulting the parent, which could be a sign of manipulation. The parent's main concern is their daughter's safety and well-being. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent has a duty to intervene if they perceive a threat.\n\nHowever, maybe the parent should have talked to the boyfriend's mother first or given the couple a chance to address the issues. But given the situation, the parent might feel it's too risky to wait. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern. The parent isn't just acting on a hunch but has specific red flags. In such cases, parental intervention is often justified to protect the child from potential harm.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the parent acted out of concern for their daughter's safety, which is a valid reason, especially when there are signs of manipulation and control.\n"
