I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent initially supported the relationship but now found concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They noticed the boyfriend's mother acting inappropriately, like calling the daughter her \"future daughter,\" criticizing how the parent raised their child, and taking control of the daughter's mental health decisions without informing the actual parent. The mother also pressured the daughter to move in with them. The parent confronted the boyfriend's mother, who then involved the boyfriend, who berated the daughter. The parent felt this was toxic and decided to end the relationship to protect their daughter.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the parent has the right to be concerned about their child's well-being, especially since the daughter is a minor. The boyfriend's mother's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially in a way that undermines the parent's role. The parent's decision to intervene might be seen as a protective measure rather than an overreach. However, breaking up a relationship is a big step, so I need to check if there were other steps the parent could have taken first, like involving authorities or counselors. But given the described red flags\u2014manipulation, mental health interference, pressure to move in\u2014it's reasonable for the parent to act to protect their child.\n\nThe boyfriend's support of his mother's actions suggests he's complicit, which adds to the parent's concern. The parent isn't acting out of jealousy but out of genuine safety concerns. The daughter's well-being is the priority here. So the answer is likely B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
