I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up the daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent hasn't had issues before. But now, the boyfriend's mom is acting overstepping. She's calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging a mental health appointment without informing the parent. The boyfriend's mom is taking a very active, parental role, which is concerning. The mom feels this is manipulative and toxic, especially since the boyfriend supports his mom's actions. The parent then breaks up the relationship to protect their daughter.\n\nI need to evaluate if the parent's actions were justified. The key points are the mother-in-law's behavior: overstepping boundaries, taking control of the daughter's well-being without the parent's consent, and creating a toxic environment. The parent's concern is about their daughter's safety and well-being. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent has a right to be involved in her decisions and safety. The boyfriend's support of his mom's actions might indicate he's complicit, which could make the relationship unhealthy.\n\nThe parent isn't just making a random decision; they observed multiple red flags that could be harmful. Their intervention is aimed at protecting their daughter from manipulation. In this case, the parent's actions seem reasonable. The boyfriend's mom's behavior crosses into inappropriate territory, and the parent is justified in stepping in. So the answer is likely B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
