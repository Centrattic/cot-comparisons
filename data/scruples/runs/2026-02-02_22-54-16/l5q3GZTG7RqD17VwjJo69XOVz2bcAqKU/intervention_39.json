I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's 3-year relationship was in the wrong. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17, both in high school. The parent didn't have issues before but now found out that the boyfriend's mom is acting overly involved, like a surrogate mother, making decisions about the daughter's health without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them.\n\nSo, the parent is concerned about the mother's behavior being manipulative and toxic, and that the boyfriend supports this. The parent felt forced to step in because of safety concerns. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's role. Parents have a duty to protect their children, especially minors. The boyfriend's mother's actions\u2014making medical decisions without the parent's knowledge, trying to replace the parent, and pressuring the daughter\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The parent is acting on genuine concerns for their daughter's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 16, in a long-term relationship. The parent is making a judgment call based on their perception of red flags. But maybe the parent overreacted? However, given the mother's manipulation and the boyfriend's support, the parent's actions might be justified. \n\nI think the key points are the mother's inappropriate involvement and the parent's protective instincts. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent has authority. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
