I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent wasn't against the relationship until recently. The main issues now are the boyfriend's mother acting overbearing, trying to take over the role of a parent, arranging a therapy appointment without the parent's knowledge, pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend supporting this. The parent decided to end the relationship because they felt it was toxic and a danger to their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent discovered concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother, which could be manipulative or overstepping. The mother is essentially trying to replace the daughter's own mother, which is a red flag. The parent's concern about safety and toxic dynamics might be valid. Breaking up a teenager's relationship is a big step, but the parent is acting to protect their child.\n\nIn terms of the parent's responsibility, they have a duty to ensure their daughter's well-being. If the boyfriend's mother is making decisions about mental health treatment without the parent's input, that's a problem. Also, the boyfriend supporting this behavior suggests he's complicit, which could mean the relationship isn't healthy. The parent might be justified in stepping in to prevent potential harm.\n\nHowever, breaking up their daughter's relationship could have consequences. The daughter might feel betrayed or that her parent doesn't trust her judgment. But given the parent's concerns about manipulation and safety, it's a tough call. The key factors are the mother's actions and the boyfriend's support, which point to a possible toxic environment. The parent's actions are protective, so they might not be in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no other angle where the parent overreacted. But considering the described behavior, the parent's decision seems appropriate.\n"
