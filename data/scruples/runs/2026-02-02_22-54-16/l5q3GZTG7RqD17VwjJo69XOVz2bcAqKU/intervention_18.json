I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's three-year relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old boy. The parent found out that the boyfriend's mother has been acting in a way that seems overstepping, like calling her the daughter's future mother, criticizing how the parent raised their daughter, and even arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend and his mother also pressured the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was toxic and broke the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're trying to protect their child from what they see as a manipulative and toxic situation. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem concerning\u2014invading the parent's role, making decisions without consultation, and possibly undermining the parent's authority. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern. The parent isn't just acting on one issue but multiple red flags that could indicate emotional harm. \n\nBut wait, the daughter is 16, which is a minor, so the parent does have a legal and moral responsibility to protect her. However, the relationship has been going on for three years, and the parent was previously okay with it. The issue arises after the mother of the boyfriend starts interfering. The parent's decision is based on their judgment of the situation posing a risk to their daughter's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent could be overreacting. Maybe the boyfriend's mother's actions aren't as harmful as perceived. But considering the specific examples\u2014criticizing parenting, taking control of a mental health appointment, pressuring to move in\u2014these are significant. The parent's concern is valid because they're trying to prevent their child from being manipulated. \n\nIs the parent in the wrong? If the parent acted based on genuine concerns for their daughter's safety and well-being, it's a protective measure. However, breaking up a teen's relationship is a major decision. But given the described behaviors, the parent might be justified. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions also suggests collaboration in the manipulation, making the situation more toxic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's actions are likely in the right. They're acting in their daughter's best interest based on observed harmful behaviors. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
