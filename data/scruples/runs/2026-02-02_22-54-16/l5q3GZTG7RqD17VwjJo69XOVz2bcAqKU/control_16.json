I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent found out the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, making comments about the parent's parenting, and even arranging a medical appointment for the daughter's depression. The boyfriend's mom is pushing them to move in together, and the boyfriend is involved in this. The parent felt it was toxic and made the daughter break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent is a guardian, so their concern for their child's well-being is natural. The mother-in-law's behavior does seem manipulative and overstepping. She's taking over parenting roles, which can be harmful. The boyfriend's support of this might indicate he's part of the problem.\n\nBut wait, the parent didn't just talk to the boyfriend's mom or try to resolve it. They directly told the daughter to break up. Is that overstepping? At the same time, the daughter is 16, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her from what seems like an unhealthy influence. The mother-in-law's actions are red flags, and the boyfriend enabling it. So maybe the parent is justified.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. The parent could have handled it differently, like talking to the boyfriend's parents or involving the school, but given the situation, the parent's concern is valid. The parent isn't just being overprotective but is addressing real manipulation. So answer B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
