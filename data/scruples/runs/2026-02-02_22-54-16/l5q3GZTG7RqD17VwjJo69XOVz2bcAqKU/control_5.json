I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for three years. The parents initially supported the relationship but now have concerns about the boyfriend's mother's behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They discovered the boyfriend's mother acting like a mother figure, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging mental health appointments without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was manipulative and a threat to the daughter's well-being, so they ended the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the red flags the parent observed. The boyfriend's mother overstepping by taking control of the daughter's mental health treatment without the parent's input is a big issue. Parents have a right to be involved in their child's healthcare decisions, especially regarding prescriptions. Also, the mother trying to replace the daughter's biological mother and creating a toxic environment could be harmful.\n\nThe boyfriend supporting these actions makes the situation more concerning. The parent's main concern is the daughter's safety and well-being. While the relationship was otherwise happy, the external interference from the boyfriend's family is a significant factor. The parent acting to protect their child from potential manipulation and toxic influence seems justified.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent didn't give the couple a chance to address these issues or talk directly with the boyfriend and his mother. But given the daughter's mental health being affected and the pressure to move in, the parent's intervention could be seen as necessary. The parent isn't just breaking up the relationship out of jealousy but due to clear signs of manipulation and control. \n\nIn most cases, parents are within their rights to step in when their child's well-being is at risk. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has a legal and moral responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's actions in supporting his mother's behavior also contribute to the problem. Therefore, the parent's decision to break up the relationship isn't necessarily wrong because they're prioritizing their daughter's safety over the relationship itself.\n"
