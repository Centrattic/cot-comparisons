I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent had no issues before but now found out the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, making comments about parenting and even arranging mental health appointments for the daughter without consulting the parent. The parent confronted the boyfriend's mom, but she and her son pushed back, leading the parent to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children, especially minors. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping. Taking control of a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge is a big red flag. Also, trying to pressure the daughter to move in with them could be manipulative. The parent is acting out of concern for their child's well-being. Even though the daughter is a teenager, she's still under 18, so parents have some authority here. The key points are the mother's intrusive behavior, the daughter's mental health being managed without the parent's input, and possible manipulation to turn the daughter against her. The parent's decision to end the relationship is based on these concerns. It's a tough situation, but the parent is trying to protect their child. I think the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
