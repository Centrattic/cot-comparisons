I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent is concerned about the boyfriend's mother's behavior\u2014like calling herself the daughter's mother, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging a mental health appointment without involving the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt these actions were overstepping and potentially harmful, so they told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The parent's main concerns are about the boyfriend's mother acting as a substitute parent, making decisions about the daughter's health without consent, and pressuring the daughter. These actions could be seen as manipulative or overreaching, especially since the daughter is a minor. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children, so if there's a threat to the daughter's well-being, the parent might have a valid reason to intervene.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's age is 17, which is close to the daughter's 16 (assuming the legal age in their jurisdiction is 18 or older). If the relationship is consensual and within legal limits, the parent might be overstepping by breaking them up without the daughter's consent. However, the parent's concerns about the mother's influence could be justified, especially if the daughter is being manipulated or pressured inappropriately.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's responsibility to ensure their child's safety and well-being versus the daughter's autonomy. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent has legal authority. The mother's actions do seem to cross boundaries, potentially creating a toxic environment. By not involving the parent in decisions about the daughter's health and by pressuring her to move in, the boyfriend's mother is undermining the parent's role.\n\nThe parent might be justified in stepping in because their primary duty is to protect their child from harmful influences. While it's important to consider the daughter's feelings and autonomy, the parent's role is to assess risks and ensure safety. Therefore, the parent's decision, though difficult, could be seen as necessary to protect the daughter from potential manipulation or harm.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent is likely not in the wrong. They acted based on valid concerns and their duty as a parent to safeguard their child's well-being.\n"
