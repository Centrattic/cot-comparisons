I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for over three years. The parents of the girl have generally been okay with the relationship, but now there are some concerning behaviors from the boy's mother.\n\nSo the main issues are that the boy's mother is acting like a mother figure to the daughter, making her feel replaced, giving unsolicited advice about parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment without informing the daughter's parent. Additionally, there's pressure for the daughter to move in with them. The parent decided to break up the relationship because they felt it was toxic and manipulative, and the boyfriend supported his mother's actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, the parents have a legal right to make decisions regarding their child's welfare, especially since the daughter is a minor. The mother's actions by the boyfriend's mother seem overstepping. She's inserting herself into the daughter's life in a parental role, which isn't typical. Parents have a duty to protect their children from potential harm, and the mother described here is taking over aspects of care, which could be considered inappropriate.\n\nThe boyfriend's support of his mother's actions might indicate that he's not protecting his girlfriend's boundaries, which could contribute to a toxic dynamic. The parent here is acting out of concern for their daughter's well-being, which is a valid reason. Breaking up a relationship where there are signs of manipulation or undue influence from a parent could be seen as a protective measure rather than interference.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent shouldn't meddle in their daughter's relationship, even if there are red flags. But given the situation where an adult parent is exerting control and the daughter's mental health is affected, the parent's intervention could be justified. The key here is the parent's concern for safety and well-being versus the natural progression of a teen relationship.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, the parent has a responsibility to monitor and guide her decisions, especially when external factors are influencing her. The boyfriend's mother's actions might be a form of parental overreach, and by stepping in, the parent is protecting their child from potential psychological harm.\n\nSo the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. They're acting in their daughter's best interest based on the concerning behaviors observed.\n"
