I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's 3-year relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17, both in high school. The parent's main issue is the boyfriend's mother acting overbearing. She refers to the daughter as her \"future daughter,\" criticizes the parent's parenting, arranged a therapy appointment without consulting them, and pressured the daughter to move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the kids. In many places, 16 and 17 are minors, so parents have a duty to protect their children. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem intrusive. Taking charge of a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge could be a problem, as it bypasses the parent's role. Also, pressuring a teenager to move in might be inappropriate, especially if the parent feels it's undermining their authority.\n\nThe parent has a right to be concerned about their daughter's well-being and safety. If they observed manipulative behavior from the boyfriend's mother and felt their daughter's mental health was being affected, stepping in could be justified. However, the parent chose to end the relationship directly by asking the daughter to break up with the boyfriend. Was that the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, parents should guide and educate rather than make such a drastic decision. Open communication might have been a better first step. On the other hand, if the parent felt the situation was toxic and a threat to their daughter's safety, they might believe intervention was necessary. The key is whether there were actual threats or just perceptions. The parent mentions \"countless red flags,\" which could be valid, but the decision to break up the relationship might have been rushed without giving the daughter a chance to handle it herself.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern. If he's enabling this behavior, the parent's worry is more justified. However, the parent's role is to protect, not necessarily to control their child's relationships. There's a balance between being overprotective and ensuring safety.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's concerns may be valid, the method of intervention\u2014breaking up the relationship directly\u2014could be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter and boyfriend are otherwise happy. But considering the potential manipulation and safety issues, the parent's actions might be understandable. It's a judgment call, but the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
