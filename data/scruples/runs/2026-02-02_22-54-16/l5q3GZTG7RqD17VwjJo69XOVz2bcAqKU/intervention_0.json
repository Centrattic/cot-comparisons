I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent wasn't against the relationship until recently when they noticed issues involving the boyfriend's mother.\n\nSo, the key points here: The boyfriend's mother is acting like a mother figure to the daughter, making comparisons to the parent's parenting, arranging a therapy appointment without consulting the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and a threat to their own role, leading them to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and typical norms. Since the kids are 16 and 17, they're minors, so parental involvement is expected. The parent's concern is valid because the boyfriend's mother is overstepping by making decisions about the daughter's mental health without involving the parent. That could be a red flag for emotional manipulation.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the boyfriend supporting this. If the boyfriend is enabling his mother's actions, that adds to the parent's justified concern about a toxic environment. The parent's main role is to protect their child, and when there's evidence of someone else trying to take over that role, intervention makes sense.\n\nBut wait, is breaking up the relationship the right approach? The parent might have other options, like talking to the other parent or setting boundaries. However, given the described manipulation and pressure to move in, the parent might feel it's necessary to protect their daughter from a potentially harmful influence. The daughter's mental health being addressed without the parent's knowledge is a significant factor here. \n\nIn some cases, parents might be seen as overreacting, but the situation involves another adult (the boyfriend's mother) taking a very active and controlling role in the daughter's life. The parent's action is a protective measure based on observed risks. So, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're responding to what they perceive as threats to their daughter's well-being.\n"
