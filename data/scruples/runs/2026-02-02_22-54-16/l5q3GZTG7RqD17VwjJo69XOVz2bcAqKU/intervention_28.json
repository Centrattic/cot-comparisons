I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's 3-year relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. The parent discovered the boyfriend's mother acting overbearing, trying to replace the parent, and even arranging a psychiatrist appointment without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend supported this behavior and pressured the daughter. The parent then decided to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They're concerned about their daughter's well-being, especially when a third party (the boyfriend's mother) is involved in a manipulative way. The parent is acting to protect their child from potential harm, which is a common parental instinct. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds another layer of concern, indicating possible toxicity in the relationship.\n\nLegal aspects: In many places, parents have the right to protect their minors from harmful situations. Even though the daughter is 16, she's still a minor, so the parent's intervention might be justified. The boyfriend's mother's actions could be seen as overstepping, creating a situation where the daughter is being manipulated. The parent's action to break up the relationship is a response to these red flags, which could be in the daughter's best interest.\n\nEthically, the parent's decision is based on love and protection. They're not just being overprotective but responding to concrete actions that threaten the daughter's mental health and family dynamics. The boyfriend's mother's behavior, like making medical decisions without the parent's input, crosses boundaries. The boyfriend's complicity in this is also problematic, suggesting a lack of respect for the parent's role.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent is interfering in their daughter's choice. But given the manipulative behavior from the boyfriend's side, the parent's intervention is a protective measure. The key points are the daughter's age, the parent's concern for safety, and the toxic elements introduced by the boyfriend's family. The parent isn't just ending a relationship out of jealousy but due to legitimate risks.\n\nSo, the parent's actions are a response to protect their child from a potentially harmful situation. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
