I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The situation is that the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent initially supported the relationship but now has concerns about the boyfriend's mother. The mother-in-law has been acting like a mother figure, making comments about the parent's parenting, arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without informing the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and breaks up the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the parent acted unreasonably. The key points here are the parent's justification for their actions. The boyfriend's mother overstepping boundaries by making decisions about the daughter's health, criticizing the parent, and trying to insert herself into the daughter's life. The parent's concern is about their daughter's well-being and safety, which is a valid reason to step in, especially if there's manipulation or harm. \n\nThe parent didn't just act on minor issues but on multiple red flags that indicate a toxic environment. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions suggests he's complicit, which makes the situation more concerning. The parent's decision to end the relationship is to protect their child from potential harm, which is a responsible action. \n\nOn the other hand, one might argue that the parent could have tried to address the issues with the boyfriend and his mother first, like discussing concerns directly with them. However, given the extent of the interference and the daughter's mental health being involved, the parent's intervention seems justified. The daughter's well-being is the top priority, and the parent is in a position to protect her. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
