I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent noticed the boyfriend's mother acting inappropriately\u2014calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing parenting, taking control of the daughter's mental health without consulting the parent, and pressuring her to move in. The parent intervened, thinking the situation is toxic.\n\nFirst, the parent's role is to protect their child. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem concerning. Taking control of mental health decisions without the parent's knowledge could be a red flag. The pressure to move in and the manipulative behavior, like calling herself the daughter's mother, might indicate a desire to replace the parent. The boyfriend supporting this behavior adds to the toxicity.\n\nThe parent didn't just let things slide; they were initially okay with the relationship but intervened after noticing red flags. The daughter's mental health being handled by someone else without the parent's input is a significant issue. The parent had a right to be concerned for their child's well-being. While breaking up a teenager's relationship is a big step, the parent's motivation here seems to be safety and protection, not just disapproval. So, the parent's actions, though harsh, are likely justified.\n"
