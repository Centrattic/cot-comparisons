I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent did the right thing by breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parents had no issues until recently when the boyfriend's mom started acting overbearing. The mom is trying to take over the role of a parent, making demands, and even arranging medical appointments without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend supports his mom's actions, and they're pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and stepped in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the daughter. At 16, she's a minor, so parents have a legal and moral responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is definitely concerning\u2014trying to replace the parent, making decisions about mental health without consulting the actual parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in. This seems like emotional manipulation and boundary crossing. The boyfriend's support of this behavior adds to the problem.\n\nThe parent's action was to ask the daughter to break up. While it's a parent's role to protect, breaking up a minor's relationship might be seen as overstepping if there's no immediate danger. However, given the toxic environment described, the parent might be acting in the daughter's best interest. The key here is whether the parent had valid reasons based on safety and well-being. Since the boyfriend's family is manipulating and pressuring the daughter, the parent's intervention could be justified. So, the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
