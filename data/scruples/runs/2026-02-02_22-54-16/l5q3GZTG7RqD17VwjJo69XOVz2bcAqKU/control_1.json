I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent is okay with the relationship but recently found out about the boyfriend's mother acting overly involved. She's calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, taking charge of the daughter's mental health without consulting the parent, and even pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent then decided to end the relationship due to these red flags.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent isn't wrong for being concerned about their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior does seem overstepping\u2014criticizing parenting, making medical decisions without the parent's consent, and trying to influence the daughter's living arrangements. These could be signs of manipulation or over-involvement, which are red flags.\n\nThe boyfriend's support of his mother's actions is also a problem. If both the boyfriend and his mother are pressuring the daughter, that's a toxic dynamic. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children from harmful influences. The parent's decision to break up the relationship is based on these concerns. While it's a significant step, it's motivated by safety and well-being. The parent did communicate their concerns first, so it's not an immediate overreaction without reason.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent is interfering in their child's relationship. However, given the specific actions of the boyfriend's mother and the boyfriend's support, the parent's intervention is justified. The daughter is a minor, so her parents have a duty to step in when there's a threat to her health or safety. The mother arranging mental health appointments without the parent's input is a major issue, as medical decisions typically require parental consent.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent is acting in their child's best interest. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
