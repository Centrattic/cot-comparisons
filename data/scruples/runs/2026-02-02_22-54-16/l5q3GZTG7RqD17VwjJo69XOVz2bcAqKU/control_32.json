I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent initially supported the relationship. Now, there are issues with the boyfriend's mother acting overbearing. She's trying to take on a maternal role, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging medical appointments without informing them, pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend is complicit.\n\nThe parent feels that the boyfriend's mother is trying to manipulate the daughter and undermine them. So, the parent decided to end the relationship. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider the parent's role in protecting their child. Parents have a responsibility to ensure their children's well-being. If there are signs of manipulation, control, or emotional harm from the boyfriend's family, intervening makes sense. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem to overstep boundaries\u2014criticizing the parent, making medical decisions, pressuring the daughter. The boyfriend supports this, which could indicate a toxic dynamic.\n\nHowever, breaking up a teenager's long-term relationship isn't a small decision. The parent might have acted without fully discussing it with the daughter or giving the boyfriend's family a chance to address the issues. But given the red flags, the parent might be justified in stepping in to protect their daughter's mental health and autonomy.\n\nThe daughter's depression and the mother's interference in medical decisions are serious concerns. The parent's actions could prevent further harm. So, while it's a tough call, the parent might be in the right to protect their child from a potentially toxic situation.\n"
