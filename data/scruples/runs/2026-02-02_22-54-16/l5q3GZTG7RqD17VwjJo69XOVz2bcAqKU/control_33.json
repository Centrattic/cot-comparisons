I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 16, the boyfriend is 17, and they've been dating for over three years. The parent initially didn't have an issue with the relationship, even allowing the boyfriend to stay over and eat with the family. But recently, the boyfriend's mother has been acting in a way that's concerning. She's taken on a maternal role, telling the daughter to see her as her mother, critiquing the parent's parenting, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The boyfriend's mother also arranged a therapy appointment for the daughter without informing the parent and insisted on medication. Additionally, the boyfriend supported this and was critical of the daughter for telling the parent. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up.\n\nI need to consider if the parent overstepped. The key points here are the boyfriend's mother's behavior and the parent's response. The boyfriend's mother is interfering in a way that might be inappropriate, especially since she's not the daughter's legal guardian. She's making decisions about mental health without the parent's knowledge, which is a serious issue. Also, pressuring the daughter to move in with them could be a sign of trying to control the relationship. The parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's well-being and safety. \n\nHowever, the parent's method of intervention is to tell the daughter to break up directly. That might be a problem because the parent is making a decision for the daughter, who is a minor but still in a relationship. While the parent has a right to be concerned, the approach of breaking up the relationship could be seen as overstepping. The parent should probably have discussed the situation with the daughter, maybe involved the boyfriend's mother, or even sought counseling for the daughter. \n\nBut the boyfriend's mother's actions are definitely problematic. She's encroaching on the parent's role and manipulating the situation. The parent's decision might be justified given the red flags, especially the mental health intervention without consent. So while the parent's approach could be better, the underlying issue is the other mother's inappropriate behavior. The parent is trying to protect their child, which is their responsibility. \n\nI think the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's mother's actions are the main issue here. The parent acted based on valid concerns and tried to protect their daughter from a potentially harmful situation. Even though breaking up the relationship directly might be harsh, the manipulation and control by the other parent are serious enough to warrant intervention. The parent is within their rights to step in when there's a threat to their child's well-being.\n"
