I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's three-year relationship was in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old, and the parent discovered the boyfriend's mother acting in a concerning way. The mother-in-law seems to be overstepping, acting like a mother to the daughter, making decisions about her mental health without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring her to move in. The parent felt these actions were harmful and decided to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. At 16 and 17, they're minors, so parents have a responsibility to protect them. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem problematic\u2014interfering in the daughter's mental health treatment without the parent's input, making the daughter feel like she's part of the family, and pressuring her to move in. These could be signs of manipulation or overstepping boundaries.\n\nThe parent's main concern is the daughter's safety and well-being. If there's evidence of manipulation, emotional control, or potential harm, the parent has a right to intervene. The fact that the boyfriend supported his mother's actions adds to the red flags. The parent isn't acting out of jealousy but out of concern for their child's well-being.\n\nHowever, ending a three-year relationship is a big step. The parent should consider whether they've given the boyfriend's family a chance to address the issues, perhaps through communication. But given the described actions\u2014like the mother arranging mental health appointments without consulting the parent\u2014it's a serious matter. Parents have a duty to protect their children from harmful influences, even if it means breaking up a relationship they otherwise approved of.\n\nIn this case, the parent's actions seem justified as a protective measure. The mother's behavior crosses boundaries, and the boyfriend's support of it is concerning. The parent isn't just being overprotective; they're responding to clear signs of potential harm. So, the answer would be B\u2014no, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
