I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is worried about their daughter's boyfriend's mother being overly involved in their daughter's life. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent hasn't had issues before, but now the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, criticizing how the parent raised their daughter, arranging medical appointments without informing the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and breaks up the relationship to protect their daughter.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. From the parent's perspective, they're acting out of concern for their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem invasive and could be seen as manipulative, especially with the medical appointment and the pressure to move in. The parent's decision to end the relationship could be seen as protective, even if it's breaking up a long-term relationship. However, some might argue that the parent overstepped by not discussing it with the daughter first or giving the boyfriend's family a chance to address the issues. But given the specific red flags mentioned\u2014like the mother taking control of the daughter's mental health treatment without the parent's knowledge\u2014it's hard to see this as an overreaction. The parent's primary responsibility is to their child's safety and well-being, so stepping in here is justified. The answer should be B (No).\n"
