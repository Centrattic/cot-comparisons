I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent didn't have issues before, but now the boyfriend's mom is acting overly involved, calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging mental health appointments without informing the parent. The boyfriend is also pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels it's toxic and breaks them up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the parent's actions are justified. The key points here are the level of parental control by the boyfriend's mother, the lack of consent from the parent in major decisions affecting the daughter's health, and the boyfriend's role in supporting this. The daughter is a minor, so parents have a responsibility to protect her well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping, trying to replace the parent. The parent's concern is valid because the daughter's mental health was handled without their input, which could be a red flag for manipulation. The parent acting to protect their child from what they perceive as a toxic environment isn't necessarily wrong. They have a duty of care here. The boyfriend's mother's actions cross boundaries, and the parent stepping in could be seen as necessary. So the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
