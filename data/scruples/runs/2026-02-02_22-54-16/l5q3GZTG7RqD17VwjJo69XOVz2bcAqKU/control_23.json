I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship with her boyfriend because of the boyfriend's mother's behavior. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 16, the boyfriend is 17. They've been dating three years. The parent has been okay with the relationship until recently. Now, the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure to the daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging therapy appointments without the parent's knowledge, pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend is supporting this.\n\nThe parent is concerned about the mother's manipulative behavior and the boyfriend's complicity. They feel the mother is trying to take over the parent's role, which is a red flag. The parent's main concern is the daughter's safety and well-being.\n\nLegally, the parent has the right to make decisions for a minor child. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem overstepping, especially with the mental health aspects. The boyfriend isn't a minor, but since the daughter is still a minor, the parent has authority. The parent is acting on valid concerns to protect the daughter from a potentially toxic situation. Breaking up the relationship might be harsh, but the parent's actions are aimed at the daughter's safety. So, the parent isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
