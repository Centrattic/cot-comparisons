I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent who broke up the daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent usually supported the relationship but now found concerning behaviors from the boyfriend's mother. The mother acts like a parent, calls the daughter her future daughter, critiques the parent's parenting, arranges therapy appointments without involving the parent, pressures the daughter about medication, and even wants her to move in. The boyfriend supports his mom's actions.\n\nThe parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up. The question is whether the parent is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping, acting as a parent figure, and undermining the parent. The daughter is still a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The mother's actions could be seen as parental appropriation or emotional manipulation. The boyfriend's support of this might indicate he's complicit. The parent's intervention could be justified as protecting their child from a potentially harmful dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent is overstepping by breaking up the relationship, even if the daughter is happy. But given the mother's behavior and the parent's role in safeguarding their child, the parent's actions might be necessary. The daughter is 16, so still under parental guidance. The red flags mentioned are significant. \n\nSo the answer is likely B, the parent is not in the wrong because they're protecting their daughter from a toxic influence.\n"
