I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's 3-year relationship was in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old, and the parent has concerns about the boyfriend's mother overstepping.\n\nFirst, the parent noticed the boyfriend's mom acting like a mother figure, giving unsolicited advice and even arranging a therapy appointment without the parent's knowledge. The mom also pressured the daughter to take medication. The boyfriend supported this and even tried to prevent the daughter from telling her real mom. Plus, there's talk about moving in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and a threat to their relationship with their daughter.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the parent was right to break up the relationship. The user thinks the parent is not wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nThe parent's actions were based on concerns for their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior does seem overbearing and possibly controlling. Arranging mental health appointments without consent and pressuring medication use is concerning. The boyfriend enabling this by reprimanding his girlfriend for telling her mom adds to the red flags. The parent's intervention might be seen as protective, even if it's a tough decision. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent overstepped by breaking up the relationship directly. But given the circumstances\u2014potential manipulation, gaslighting, and threats to the daughter's safety\u2014the parent's actions could be justified. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's actions could be a form of parental alienation or emotional manipulation. The parent isn't just acting on suspicion but on concrete examples. \n\nSo, in this case, the parent's decision seems to stem from a place of concern rather than jealousy or control. The answer is likely B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
