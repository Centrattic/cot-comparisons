I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent found out that the boyfriend's mother is acting like a mother figure, even arranging mental health appointments without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was toxic and made the daughter break up with the boyfriend.\n\nSo first, the parent's main concern is about the mother-in-law's behavior. She's called the daughter her future daughter, criticized how the parent raised her, and took control of her mental health treatment. The boyfriend is supporting this, and they're pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent steps in because they see red flags and fear for the daughter's safety.\n\nLegal aspects: In many places, parents have a responsibility to protect their minor children from harmful situations. Since the daughter is 16, she's still a minor, so the parent has some authority here. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem manipulative and overstepping. Arranging medical appointments without informing the parent could be a problem, especially if the daughter is a minor. Also, pressuring a minor to move in might involve legal issues like abuse of influence.\n\nEmotionally, the parent is trying to protect their child from what they perceive as a toxic environment. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern. The parent isn't just being controlling; they're responding to specific harmful behaviors. The daughter was showing signs of depression, which the parent's own actions might not have addressed, but the boyfriend's mother took control without parental input.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the parent overreacted, or the situation isn't as bad as they think. However, the described actions\u2014manipulation, medical decisions without consent, pressure to move in\u2014are serious red flags. The parent's intervention is to prevent potential harm, which is a parent's duty.\n\nConclusion: The parent is acting to protect their child from what they see as harmful influences. Unless there's evidence that the parent's judgment is flawed or they have ulterior motives, their actions are justified. Answer B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
