I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent did the right thing by breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17. The main issues seem to be the boyfriend's mother acting like a parent to the daughter, making decisions about her mental health without the parent's knowledge, and pressuring them to move in. The parent felt this was too much and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They had a long-term relationship that was previously fine. The red flags the parent noticed are significant: the mother-in-law taking on a parental role, making medical decisions, and possibly manipulating the daughter. The parent had a duty to protect their child, so stepping in might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent didn't consult with their daughter or the boyfriend's mother first. Maybe there was a way to address the issues without breaking up the relationship. But the situation does involve potential manipulation and overstepping boundaries, which could be harmful to a minor. The parent's concern for safety and well-being is valid. So the parent's action, while drastic, might be understandable. Answer B.\n"
