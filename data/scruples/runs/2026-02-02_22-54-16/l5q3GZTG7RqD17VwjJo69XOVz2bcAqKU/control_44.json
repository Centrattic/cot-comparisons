I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for over three years. The parent was initially okay with the relationship. Now, there are some concerning issues with the boyfriend's mother. She's acting like a mother figure, criticizing how the parent raised the daughter, arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge, pressuring the daughter to take medication, and even pushing for her to move in. The boyfriend supports this, and the parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they broke up the couple.\n\nFirst, the parent's main concern is the boyfriend's mother's behavior. The mother is overstepping boundaries by taking on a parental role, making decisions about the daughter's health without consulting the parent, and trying to create a divide between the daughter and her own mother. That seems like a red flag. The boyfriend, being part of this, isn't just passive; he's supporting his mother's actions. The parent is worried about their daughter's safety and mental health here.\n\nThe daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's actions\u2014like arranging medication without the parent's consent\u2014could be problematic. The parent's intervention to stop a relationship that's contributing to a toxic environment might be justified. The question is whether breaking up the couple was the right move. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is dating someone her own age, and the parent might be overreacting. But given the manipulative behavior from the boyfriend's side, the parent's actions could be protective. The parent did mention feeling the relationship's underbelly is toxic, which is a valid concern when a third party (the boyfriend's mother) is involved in a harmful way.\n\nSo the parent's decision to break them up is based on protecting their daughter from what they perceive as an unsafe situation. Unless there's a law being broken (like the age of consent, which in most places 17 is okay for 16), the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key issue is the third-party manipulation, not the relationship itself. Therefore, the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
