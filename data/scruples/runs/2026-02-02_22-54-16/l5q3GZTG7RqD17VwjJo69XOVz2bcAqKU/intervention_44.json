I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the parent is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for three years. The parent initially supported their relationship but now has concerns about the boy's mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is acting in a way that seems to be overstepping. She's calling the daughter her \"future daughter,\" criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge. That's a big deal because mental health decisions usually involve the parent, especially for a minor. The boy's mother is essentially taking on a parental role, which could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend is supporting this behavior. If the son is pressuring his girlfriend to move in with them and isn't standing up to his mother, that's a red flag. The parent is worried about their daughter's safety and the manipulative dynamics here. Breaking up the relationship because of these red flags might be a protective measure. \n\nThe parent isn't just acting on a hunch; there are specific instances of interference and potential manipulation. The daughter is under 18, so the parent has a legal and ethical duty to protect her. Even though the daughter is in a long-term relationship, the parent's role is to ensure her well-being. The mother-in-law's actions could be considered parental substitution, which is harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent could consider if there's a way to address the issues with the boyfriend's family without breaking up the relationship. But given the persistent red flags and the daughter's mental health being involved, the parent's intervention seems justified. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions suggests that he isn't a protective figure, which adds to the parent's concern.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong here. They're acting to protect their daughter from a potentially toxic and manipulative situation. Answer B makes sense.\n"
