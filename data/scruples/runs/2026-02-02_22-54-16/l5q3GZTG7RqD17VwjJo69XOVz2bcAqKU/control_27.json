I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. So, the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parents were okay with the relationship until they noticed some concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother is acting like a surrogate parent, telling the daughter to think of her as a mother, calling her a future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging medical appointments for the daughter without informing the parent. The boyfriend supports this and is pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is a toxic situation and broke up the relationship to protect their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They intervened because they noticed red flags that could harm their daughter. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping, possibly manipulating the daughter. The boyfriend is involved in this, which adds to the parent's concern. \n\nIn terms of the parent's responsibility, they have a duty to protect their child from potential harm, especially emotional and psychological. The situation described does show signs of manipulation and overstepping boundaries. The boyfriend's mother arranging medical treatment without the parent's knowledge is a significant issue. \n\nHowever, the parent didn't let the daughter decide on her own, which is a point to consider. At 16, the daughter is still a minor, so parents have authority until she turns 18. But breaking up a three-year relationship is a big step. The parent might have acted out of fear, but they might not have given the daughter a chance to address the issues herself or seek help. \n\nBut given the boyfriend's mother's actions and the boyfriend supporting it, the parent is justified in stepping in. The key here is whether the parent's intervention was necessary to prevent harm. The facts presented suggest the parent was acting in the daughter's best interest despite the daughter's happiness. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong because they were trying to protect their daughter from a potentially toxic and manipulative situation. The boyfriend's mother's behavior crosses boundaries, and the boyfriend's support exacerbates the issue. The parent's concerns are valid, and breaking up the relationship was a protective measure.\n"
