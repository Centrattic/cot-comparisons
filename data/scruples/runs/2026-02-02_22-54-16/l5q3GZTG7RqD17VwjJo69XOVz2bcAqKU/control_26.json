I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend is 17, they've been dating for three years. The parent found out that the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, even to the point of arranging therapy for the daughter without the parent's knowledge. The mom is also criticizing the parent's parenting and pushing the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and a threat to their relationship with their daughter, so they broke them up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the U.S., 16 is a minor, and parents have the legal right to make decisions regarding their children's relationships, especially if there's a concern about safety or well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem concerning\u2014acting as a surrogate parent, making medical decisions without consulting the actual parent, and possibly manipulating the relationship. This could be a form of parental overstepping or even emotional abuse from the boyfriend's mother's side.\n\nThe parent's decision to end the relationship is based on protecting their daughter from what they perceive as a toxic and manipulative situation. They have valid concerns about the other mother's influence and the boyfriend's support of this behavior. The parent isn't just acting out of jealousy but is responding to specific red flags that could impact the daughter's mental health and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent is overreacting or interfering in their daughter's autonomy. However, given the daughter's age and the involvement of another parent in a potentially harmful way, the parent's actions are within their rights and responsibilities to protect their child. The boyfriend's mother's behavior, especially the unsolicited medical interventions and pressure to move in, are significant issues that justify the parent's concern.\n\nSo, considering the parent's role in safeguarding their child's well-being and the manipulative actions of the boyfriend's mother, the parent is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
