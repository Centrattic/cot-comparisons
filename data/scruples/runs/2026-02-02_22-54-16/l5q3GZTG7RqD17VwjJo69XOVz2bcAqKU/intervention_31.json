I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent never had issues before but now found out that the boyfriend's mom is acting very overbearing. The mom refers to the daughter as her future daughter, criticizes how the parent raised her, and even arranged a therapy appointment without consulting the parent. The daughter was feeling depressed, and the boyfriend's mom took control of that situation. The parent confronts this and ends the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions for minors, especially regarding their well-being. The daughter is a minor, so the parent's actions might be justified under the premise of protecting her. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems manipulative and possibly overstepping boundaries. She's trying to insert herself into the daughter's life in a parental role without the consent of the actual parent. This could be seen as a form of emotional manipulation or even grooming, which is harmful.\n\nThe boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds another layer. If he's involved in pressuring the daughter to move in with them, that might indicate a lack of respect for the daughter's boundaries and the parent's role. The parent's concern for safety and the toxic environment is valid. Breaking up the relationship to prevent potential harm might be a responsible action rather than being in the wrong.\n\nHowever, one could argue that the parent might have overstepped by ending the relationship without allowing the daughter to handle the situation herself, especially since she's 16 and might be developing independence. But considering the daughter's age and the manipulative aspects from the boyfriend's family, the parent's intervention could be necessary for her safety and mental health.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the parent's actions seem justified as they are protecting their child from a potentially toxic and manipulative relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
