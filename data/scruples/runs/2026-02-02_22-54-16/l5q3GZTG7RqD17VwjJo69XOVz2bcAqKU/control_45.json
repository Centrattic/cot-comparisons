I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent initially supported the relationship but found concerning behaviors from the boyfriend's mother.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mom starts acting like a mother figure, telling the daughter to think of her as her mom, calling her a future daughter, and criticizing how the parent raised the daughter. That's already a red flag. Then, when the daughter feels depressed, the boyfriend's mom arranges an appointment and insists on medication without informing the parent. The parent is upset and confronts the boyfriend, who then criticizes the daughter for telling the parent. Plus, there's pressure for the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and breaks up the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's overstepping boundaries, the lack of communication with the parent, and the potential manipulation. The parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's safety. The boyfriend's mom is taking on a parental role without the parent's consent, which could be harmful. The boyfriend supports this, making the situation more concerning. Since the parent's actions are to protect their child from what they perceive as a toxic environment, they're likely not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
