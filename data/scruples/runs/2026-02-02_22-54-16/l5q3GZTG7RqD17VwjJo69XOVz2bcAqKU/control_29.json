I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation is a 16-year-old dating a 17-year-old for over three years, which the parent was okay with until recently.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom started acting like a mother figure, making comments about the parent's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without the parent's knowledge. The mom also pressured the daughter to move in with them. The parent confronted the boyfriend's mom, who then told the son to berate the daughter for telling. The parent then broke up the relationship due to these red flags.\n\nSo, the parent is concerned about the mother's manipulative behavior and the boyfriend's support of it. The key points here are the mother's overstepping boundaries, potential emotional manipulation, and the parent's role in protecting their daughter. \n\nLegally, the daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to ensure her well-being. The boyfriend's mom's actions could be seen as overbearing and possibly undermining the parent's authority. The parent's decision to break up the relationship might be an attempt to protect the daughter from a potentially harmful situation. \n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? The parent isn't directly harming the daughter; they're reacting to perceived threats from the other parent. The boyfriend's mom's actions are questionable, and the boyfriend enabling that by berating the daughter for speaking up adds to the toxicity. \n\nHowever, breaking up a healthy relationship could also be seen as overreach if there's no immediate danger. But given the described behavior of the boyfriend's family, the parent has valid concerns. So the answer would likely be B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
