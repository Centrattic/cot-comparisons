I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy. They've been together for three years, and initially, the parent was happy. But then the boyfriend's mom started acting like a mother figure, making comments about the parent's parenting, and even arranging mental health appointments for the daughter without consulting the parent. The daughter became depressed, and the stepmom took control of her treatment. The parent confronts this, but the boyfriend gets angry and supports his mom's actions. The parent then breaks up the relationship.\n\nSo, the parent's concern is about the boyfriend's mother being overbearing and possibly manipulative, trying to take over the daughter's care. The parent feels this is toxic and a threat to their relationship with their daughter. The question is whether the parent is wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, 16 or 17 is still a minor, and parents do have legal authority to make decisions regarding their child's relationships. However, the parent here isn't necessarily breaking up the relationship for the daughter's legal right to choose, but because of the third-party interference from the boyfriend's mother.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The parent is worried about their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions\u2014criticizing the parent's parenting, taking control of mental health decisions without consent, pressuring the daughter to move in with them\u2014could be signs of manipulation or control. The parent feels these red flags are a threat to their daughter's safety and their relationship with her.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is negative, berating the daughter for telling his mom about the parent's concerns. This suggests that he's not supportive of the parent's involvement and may be enabling his mother's behavior.\n\nIn terms of the parent's actions, they are acting out of concern for their daughter's safety and well-being. While the daughter is an adolescent, parents are typically expected to step in when there's a threat from external parties. The parent isn't forcing the daughter to break up but is making a decision based on the risks they perceive.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue here: the parent is deciding for the daughter instead of involving her in the decision-making process. But considering the daughter is 16, parents often have the authority to make such decisions. Also, the daughter's mental health is a concern, and the parent's action could be seen as protective.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent is overstepping by breaking up a healthy relationship without the daughter's consent. But the key here is the third-party manipulation by the boyfriend's mother. The parent is responding to an external threat rather than the relationship itself. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the parent's decision is likely reasonable given the risky behavior of the boyfriend's mother and the boyfriend's complicity. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here.\n"
