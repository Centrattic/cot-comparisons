I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent didn't have issues before, but now there are some concerning actions from the boyfriend's mother.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, making the daughter think of her as her mom, calling her future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting. Then she arranges a mental health appointment for the daughter without informing the parent and insists on medication. The boyfriend also supports this and pressures the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up.\n\nSo, the parent is acting to protect their child from what they perceive as a harmful influence. The key points here are the mother's overstepping, the pressure on the daughter, and the boyfriend enabling this. The parent is concerned about safety and manipulation. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mom's actions seem inappropriate and possibly abusive. The parent isn't just acting on a hunch but has specific red flags. Breaking up the relationship to prevent potential harm might be justified. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
