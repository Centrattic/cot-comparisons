I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up a 16-year-old daughter's 3-year relationship with a 17-year-old boy is wrong. The parent had no issues before but discovered concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother. The mother was acting overbearing, trying to take over the role of the parent, pressuring the daughter, and even arranging mental health appointments without involving the parent. The parent felt it was toxic and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, the daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's actions cross boundaries by overstepping and creating a toxic environment. The parent intervened to prevent potential harm, which is a parent's role. The boyfriend's involvement in this manipulation is a red flag. While the parent might have acted abruptly, the underlying issues are significant. The parent isn't necessarily wrong for acting in their child's best interest. So, the answer is B.\n"
