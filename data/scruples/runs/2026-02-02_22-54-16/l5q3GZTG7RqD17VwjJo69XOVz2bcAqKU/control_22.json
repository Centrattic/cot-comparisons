I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a parent breaking up their 16-year-old daughter's 3-year relationship because of concerns about the boyfriend's mother's behavior. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17, and they've been dating for a while. The parent hasn't had issues before, but recently the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure to the daughter, calling her \"future daughter,\" criticizing how the parent raised the daughter, and even arranging a mental health appointment without informing the parent. The boyfriend is supporting his mom's actions, and they're pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent is worried it's toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's role. Parents have a duty to protect their children, especially minors. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem to overstep. Acting like a mother, making medical decisions without the parent's knowledge, and trying to undermine the parent's authority\u2014that's concerning. The parent is worried about the daughter's safety and well-being, which is a valid reason to intervene. \n\nHowever, the parent also ended the relationship. At 16, the daughter is a minor, so the parent has legal authority to make decisions regarding her relationships, especially if they believe it's harmful. The actions of the boyfriend's mother do cross ethical boundaries. The boyfriend is not just a passive participant; he's supporting his mom's actions. So the parent's decision might be justified as they're acting in the child's best interest.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parent is overstepping by breaking up the relationship. But given the potential manipulation and the daughter's mental health being involved without the parent's consent, the parent's intervention is a protective measure. The key points here are the mother's manipulative behavior, the boyfriend's support, and the daughter's age. The parent is not the one acting manipulatively; they're responding to red flags. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
