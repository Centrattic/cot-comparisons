I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's three-year relationship. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17. The main issues are the boyfriend's mother acting overbearing, trying to take over maternal roles, pressuring the daughter, and the parents involved in her mental health without the actual parent's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent discovered these things and felt the situation was toxic. They stepped in to end the relationship. But is that justified? Well, the parent is concerned about their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother is interfering in a way that's inappropriate\u2014criticizing parenting, making decisions about medical appointments, pressuring the daughter. That seems like emotional manipulation. The boyfriend is supporting this, which adds to the parent's concern.\n\nThe parent's responsibility is to protect their child. Even though the relationship has lasted three years and the parent was okay before, new red flags can emerge. The mother-in-law's behavior is crossing boundaries, trying to replace the parent. The daughter's depression being addressed by the boyfriend's mother without the parent's involvement is a red flag for control. The parent acting to stop the relationship is a protective measure. Legally, the daughter is a minor, so the parent has authority. But was there a need to break them up? It's a tough call. However, the parent is responding to real threats to their daughter's mental health and autonomy. So the parent's action is a reasonable response to protect their child from a potentially harmful situation. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
