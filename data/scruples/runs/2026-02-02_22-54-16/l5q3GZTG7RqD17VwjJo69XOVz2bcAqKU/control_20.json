I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's 3-year relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. The main issues are the boyfriend's mother acting like a mother figure, criticizing the author's parenting, controlling the daughter's mental health, and pressuring her to move in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's role. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children, especially minors, from harmful situations. The mother here is worried about her daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping by taking control of the daughter's mental health decisions without involving the parent. That's a red flag because parents should be involved in their child's health decisions.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's support of his mother's actions suggests a toxic dynamic. The pressure to move in could be manipulative or even a form of coercion. The parent is acting out of concern for safety and well-being. While the daughter is in a long-term relationship, she's still a minor, so the parent has the legal and moral right to intervene if there's abuse or neglect.\n\nThe key points are the mother-in-law's controlling behavior, the boyfriend enabling it, and potential harm to the daughter. Breaking up the relationship to prevent further harm isn't in the wrong. The parent isn't just being overprotective but responding to clear manipulative tactics. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
