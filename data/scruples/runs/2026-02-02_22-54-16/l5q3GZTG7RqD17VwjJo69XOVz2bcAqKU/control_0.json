I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's 3-year relationship. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend is 17. The main issues are the boyfriend's mother acting like a mother figure, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's consent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt it was too manipulative and broke them up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. At 16 and 17, they're minors, so parents have a responsibility to protect their children. The boyfriend's mother overstepping by making decisions about the daughter's mental health without the parent's knowledge is a problem. Parents typically have the right to be involved in their child's medical appointments, especially for prescriptions. The mother's actions could be seen as undermining the parent's authority and potentially manipulating the daughter. The boyfriend supporting this behavior is concerning, as it might indicate a lack of respect for the parent's role.\n\nHowever, the parent did step in after a long relationship where they were previously okay with the relationship. The question is whether the parent overreacted. The key factors here are the mother-in-law's manipulative behavior, the boyfriend's support, and the parent's concern for the daughter's safety. Since the parent is acting in their child's best interest to protect her from what they perceive as a toxic influence, they might be justified. On the other hand, if the parent didn't give the daughter a chance to handle it or didn't consider the daughter's wishes, that could be an issue. But given the described red flags, the parent's intervention seems reasonable. So the answer is likely B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
