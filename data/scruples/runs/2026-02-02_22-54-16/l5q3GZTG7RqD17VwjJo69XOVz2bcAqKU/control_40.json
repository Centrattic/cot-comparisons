I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent's main issue is with the boyfriend's mother acting overbearing, trying to take over the parent's role, pressuring the daughter, and even arranging medical appointments without the parent's knowledge. The parent felt it was toxic and broke them up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the parent acted unreasonably. The parent noticed several red flags: the mother-in-law's overstepping, controlling behavior, and the boyfriend's support of that. The parent's concern for their daughter's safety and well-being seems valid. Even though the daughter is a minor, parents have the right to protect her from harmful influences. The boyfriend's mother's actions could be considered manipulative and a threat to the parent-child relationship. The parent isn't just acting on a hunch but has specific examples of troubling behavior. The parent's decision to end the relationship is based on protecting their daughter from what they perceive as a toxic environment. The boyfriend and his mother's reaction (berating the daughter for telling the parent) suggests they were trying to undermine the parent. Given that, the parent's intervention seems justified. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
