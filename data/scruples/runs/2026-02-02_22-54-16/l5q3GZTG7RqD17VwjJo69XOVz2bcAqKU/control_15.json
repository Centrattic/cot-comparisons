I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the parent) is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent didn't have issues before but now is concerned about the boyfriend's mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, the mother of the boyfriend is acting like a mother figure to the daughter. She's calling her future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging a mental health appointment without informing the parent. The boyfriend's mother is pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and toxic.\n\nThe parent confronted the daughter's boyfriend, who then berated the daughter for telling the parent. The parent broke up the relationship due to these red flags. The question is whether the parent is wrong.\n\nI need to consider the parent's role. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children from potential harm. The boyfriend's mother's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries. Arranging a medical appointment without the parent's knowledge is a red flag. Pressuring the daughter to move in with them might be another sign of manipulation. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions could indicate he's complicit or not protecting his girlfriend.\n\nThe parent's decision to break up the relationship might be based on valid concerns. However, it's a parent stepping in directly, which can be a sensitive issue. The daughter is 16, so she's still a minor, and the parent has legal authority. But the relationship was long-term, so the parent's intervention could be seen as overstepping, depending on the situation.\n\nBut considering the mother's actions\u2014criticizing the parent, taking control of the daughter's mental health decisions, and pressuring to move in\u2014it's possible the parent is justified in being concerned. The boyfriend's reaction to the daughter informing the parent suggests he's not supportive of her independence or communication with her family.\n\nIn such cases, the parent's primary concern is the child's well-being. If there's a pattern of manipulation and control, the parent's intervention might be necessary. However, breaking up the relationship outright could be seen as harsh. Maybe involving the daughter in the decision-making or seeking counseling first would be better. But given the circumstances, the parent might feel that immediate action is needed.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If the parent acted out of genuine concern for their daughter's safety and well-being, then perhaps not. The answer would be B (No). But if the parent acted without considering the daughter's perspective or overreacted, maybe A (Yes). However, the described actions of the boyfriend's mother and the boyfriend's support do seem like red flags. The parent's decision is based on protecting their daughter from a potentially toxic environment. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
