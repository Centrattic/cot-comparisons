I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's 3-year relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17.\n\nSo the parent found out that the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother to the daughter. She's calling her \"future daughter,\" criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging a therapist appointment without informing the parent. The daughter mentioned feeling depressed, and the boyfriend's mom took charge of getting help, insisting on medication. Then the boyfriend is supporting this and there's pressure to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and toxic, so they broke them up.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about parental control and the well-being of the daughter. The parent is concerned about the boyfriend's mother overstepping and possibly manipulating the daughter. The daughter is a minor, so her parents have a duty of care. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem intrusive\u2014acting as if she's the mother, making decisions without the parent's consent, pressuring the daughter. The boyfriend is involved in this too, by supporting his mom's actions and not standing up to her.\n\nIn terms of the parent's actions, they are stepping in because they believe their child is in a toxic situation. Even though the couple has been together a long time, the parent's responsibility is to protect their child from harmful influences. The boyfriend's mom's behavior crosses boundaries, and the boyfriend's complicity is a red flag. The parent isn't just acting out of jealousy but genuine concern for their daughter's mental and emotional health.\n\nThe daughter is 16, so she's still under her parents' legal guardianship. The parent is within their rights to intervene if they see potential harm. While it's a tough decision to break up a long-term relationship, the parent's motivation here seems to be protection rather than control. The boyfriend's mother's actions could be seen as manipulative, trying to undermine the parent's role. The daughter's depression is a serious issue, and the fact that the boyfriend's mother took charge without the parent's knowledge could be harmful, especially if the treatment isn't appropriate.\n\nSo, putting this together, the parent is not in the wrong. They acted based on valid concerns for their daughter's safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is definitely crossing lines, and the boyfriend's support of that makes the situation worse. The parent's intervention is justified to prevent potential harm to their child.\n"
