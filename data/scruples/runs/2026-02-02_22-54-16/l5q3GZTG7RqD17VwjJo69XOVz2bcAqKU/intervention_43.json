I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 16-year-old dating a 17-year-old, which is legal in most places, but there are some concerning behaviors from the boyfriend's mother.\n\nFirst, the mother's actions: she's positioning herself as a mother figure, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging a medical appointment for the daughter without informing the parent. That's a red flag. The boyfriend is involved in pressuring the daughter to move in with them, which further complicates things. The parent felt the relationship was becoming toxic and manipulative, so they stepped in to break it up.\n\nThe parent's main concern is the daughter's safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mother is acting overstepping, possibly trying to replace the parent. The parent isn't just being overprotective; they have specific reasons based on actions that could be harmful. The daughter is under 18, so the parents have legal responsibility and a right to be concerned about her mental health and safety.\n\nWhile it's true that the daughter is in a relationship, the parent's role is to protect her from potential abuse or manipulation. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is invasive and could be seen as grooming or trying to control the daughter. The parent isn't acting out of jealousy but from legitimate concerns about the daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions makes the situation more problematic because it suggests he's complicit in undermining the parent.\n\nIn this case, the parent's decision to break up the relationship is based on protecting their child from a potentially toxic environment. Even though the daughter might be happy on the surface, the underlying issues are significant. The parent isn't just making a personal choice but is responding to a situation where another adult is overstepping boundaries, which could lead to more serious issues if left unchecked. Therefore, the parent is justified in their actions.\n"
