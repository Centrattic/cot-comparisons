I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is concerned about their daughter's boyfriend's mother's behavior. The boyfriend is 17, daughter is 16, and they've been dating for three years. The parent hasn't had issues before, but now the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without informing the parent, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and toxic, so they broke up the couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the parent is overstepping. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem intrusive and possibly overstepping. Taking a minor's mental health into her own hands without informing the actual parent is concerning. There's also the pressure to move in, which could indicate control issues. The boyfriend supporting this behavior adds to the parent's concern about toxicity.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is intervening in their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, so the parent might have the right to step in if they perceive danger. The question is whether the parent had a valid reason. The red flags mentioned\u2014mother acting as a substitute parent, manipulating the daughter, not informing the parent about mental health\u2014do seem like valid concerns. The parent's actions are protective, even if they ended the relationship. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical boundaries, parents are supposed to safeguard their children's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior crosses into inappropriate territory by assuming a parental role. The parent's decision to break them up is based on protecting their daughter from potential harm. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in their child's best interest based on the described circumstances.\n"
