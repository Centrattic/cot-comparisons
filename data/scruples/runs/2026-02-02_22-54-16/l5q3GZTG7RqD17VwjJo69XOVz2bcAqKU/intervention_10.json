I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's three-year relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. The parent found out that the boyfriend's mother has been acting inappropriately, like calling herself the daughter's future mother, giving unsolicited advice about parenting, and even arranging medical appointments without informing the parent. The parent felt this was manipulative and a threat to their relationship with their daughter, so they asked the daughter to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. Breaking up a teenager's relationship is a big step. But the parent's concern stems from valid safety issues. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping and potentially harmful. The parent acted out of concern for their daughter's well-being. Legally, the parents have a duty to protect their minor children from harmful influences. The daughter is still under 18, so the parent has a right to be involved in decisions affecting her safety and mental health. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the daughter's autonomy. At 16, she might feel her relationship is her choice. But if there's evidence of manipulation or toxicity, the parent's intervention could be justified. The key factors here are the mother's manipulative behavior, the pressure on the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend's support of this. The parent's actions were based on protecting their daughter from what they perceive as a toxic environment.\n\nSo, considering the parent acted in their child's best interest to prevent potential harm, I think the parent is not in the wrong. They had a reasonable concern given the red flags and took action to safeguard their daughter.\n"
