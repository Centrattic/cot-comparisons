I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's three-year relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17. The parent noticed the boyfriend's mom acting like a second mother, giving advice, even arranging therapy without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend and his mom are pushing the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was manipulative and broke up the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, the legal age for consent is typically 16 or 17 depending on the state, so the relationship itself is legally okay. However, the parent's concern is more about the mother's behavior. The mother-in-law is overstepping, acting as a de facto parent and possibly manipulating the situation. The parent is worried about their daughter's mental health and safety, especially since the daughter mentioned feeling depressed and the mother arranged therapy without consulting the parent. \n\nParental rights usually allow parents to make decisions for their minor children, especially regarding health and safety. The parent here is concerned about potential manipulation and the daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's involvement in pressuring the daughter to move in adds another layer. The parent might feel that the relationship is becoming toxic and that the daughter is being influenced by someone who isn't her parent. \n\nHowever, the parent is also intervening directly by breaking up the relationship. This could be seen as overstepping if the daughter is old enough to make her own decisions, but given the parent's concerns, they might believe it's necessary to protect her. The key points here are the mother's manipulation, the parent's responsibility to protect their child, and the daughter's age. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent has a legal and ethical duty to act in her best interest. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem intrusive and possibly harmful, so the parent's decision might be justified. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the parent should have discussed this with the daughter first, allowing her to make her own choices. But given the potential manipulation and the parent's role in protecting their child, it's a close call. The parent isn't in the wrong because they're acting out of concern for their daughter's welfare, which is a parent's right and responsibility.\n"
