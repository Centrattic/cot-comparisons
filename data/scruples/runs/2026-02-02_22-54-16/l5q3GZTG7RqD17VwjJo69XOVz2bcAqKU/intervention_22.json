I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the parent did the right thing by breaking up their daughter's 3-year relationship because of the boyfriend's mother's behavior and the boyfriend's support of it.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 16, the boyfriend is 17. They've been dating for over three years, and the parent was initially happy. The issue arises with the boyfriend's mother acting in ways that seem overstepping. She's calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, taking control of the daughter's mental health by arranging an appointment and pushing medication, and even suggesting moving in with them. The boyfriend is involved in pressuring the daughter to move in with them.\n\nThe parent felt that the mother is trying to undermine her own parenting, which is a valid concern. The boyfriend's support of these actions is problematic. The parent's main worry is the daughter's safety and well-being due to these red flags. They decided to break up the relationship to protect their daughter.\n\nNow, the key points here: the parent isn't acting out of jealousy or wanting to control their daughter's dating life but based on genuine concerns about manipulation and potential harm. The boyfriend and his mother are overstepping boundaries, which can be considered toxic. The parent is reacting to protect their child, which is a common and understandable reason for stepping in.\n\nBut is the parent overreacting? Maybe not. The mother in-law's behavior is concerning, especially in a minor's life. The parent has the right to feel that their child is being influenced in a harmful way. However, breaking up a relationship is a big decision. The parent might not have tried to address the issues directly with the boyfriend and his mother first, like having a conversation or setting boundaries. But given the situation described, it's possible that the parent felt immediate action was necessary to prevent further manipulation.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter is 16, still a minor, so parents have a responsibility to her safety. The boyfriend's mother acting as a surrogate parent without the parent's consent is a boundary issue. The boyfriend enabling this by supporting the pressure to move in adds to the concern.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's actions stem from protecting their daughter from what they perceive as a toxic and manipulative situation. While breaking up the relationship is a drastic step, it's done with the daughter's well-being in mind. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
