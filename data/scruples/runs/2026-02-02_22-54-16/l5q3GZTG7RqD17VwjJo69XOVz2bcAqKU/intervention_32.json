I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's three-year relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, and the boyfriend is 17. The parent found out that the boyfriend's mother has been acting very pushy, trying to take over the role of a mother, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend supported his mother's actions and wanted the daughter to move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. At 16, the daughter is a minor, so parents have a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems overstepping\u2014criticizing the parent, controlling decisions about the daughter's health and living arrangements. That could be a form of emotional manipulation or even parental alienation. The parent might have valid concerns about the daughter's well-being and safety, especially since the boyfriend is enabling this by not standing up to his mother and even berating the daughter for telling the parent.\n\nHowever, breaking up a three-year relationship is a big step. The parent should consider if they have the right to do that. Legally, the parent can intervene if there's a risk of harm, but relationships between minors are usually considered the minors' business unless there's clear abuse or danger. The parent's actions might be seen as overprotective, but given the mother-in-law's manipulative behavior and the boyfriend's complicity, the parent's concern is justified. The key points are the mother's interference, the mental health issue being forced upon the daughter without the parent's input, and the pressure to move in. These are red flags that a parent would want to address. So the answer would likely be B (No), the parent isn't in the wrong because they're acting in their child's best interest given the toxic dynamics.\n"
