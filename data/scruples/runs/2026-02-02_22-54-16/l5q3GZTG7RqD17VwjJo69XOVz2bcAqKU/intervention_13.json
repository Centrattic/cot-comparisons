I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent has generally been okay with the relationship until recently, when they noticed concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother.\n\nSo the main issues here are the boyfriend's mother acting as a surrogate parent, giving unsolicited advice, making decisions about the daughter's mental health without consulting the actual parent, and pressuring the daughter to move into their home. The parent feels this is manipulative and toxic, leading them to intervene by breaking up the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. If there's evidence of manipulation or potential harm, the parent's role is to address that. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping by taking on a parental role without permission, which could be seen as a boundary issue. Encouraging the daughter to move out with them might also be a red flag, especially if it's without the parent's consent.\n\nThe parent's actions were based on their concerns for the daughter's well-being. They observed several red flags and decided to intervene. It's important to note that the parent isn't just reacting to one incident but a pattern of behavior that suggests control and manipulation. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern, indicating a possible toxic dynamic.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, parental alienation or in this case, maternal overreach, can be harmful. The mother-in-law's behavior might be undermining the daughter's relationship with her own parent, which is a significant concern. The parent's decision to break up the relationship is a protective measure, even if it's a difficult one.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the daughter's autonomy. At 16, she might be developing her own identity, but since she's still a minor, the parent has a legal right and responsibility to make decisions in her best interest, especially if there's a perceived threat.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent's actions were justified based on the evidence. The parent didn't act on a single suspicion but multiple concerning behaviors. They also had a conversation with their daughter about her feelings, which shows they considered her perspective. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem to cross into parental territory without consent, which is a serious issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's primary duty is to protect their child. The described situation includes elements that could be harmful, so the parent's intervention seems justified. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
