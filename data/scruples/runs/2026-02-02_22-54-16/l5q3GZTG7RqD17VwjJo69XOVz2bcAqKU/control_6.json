I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's 3-year relationship with her 17-year-old boyfriend because of the boyfriend's mother's behavior. The daughter is 16, so the parent is her legal guardian.\n\nFirst, the mother of the boyfriend has been acting like a surrogate parent, arranging therapy appointments and pushing medication. That's concerning because the parent should be the one handling their child's health. The boyfriend's mom is also criticizing the way the user raised their daughter, which is a red flag. Plus, they're pressuring the daughter to move in, which sounds like overstepping boundaries.\n\nThe user's main issue is that the boyfriend's mother is trying to insert herself into the daughter's life in a way that's undermining the parent's authority. The parent is worried about their daughter's safety and well-being. Even though the daughter is 16, she's still a minor, so the parent has the responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mom's actions could be manipulative and potentially harmful, so the parent stepping in to end the relationship because of that seems justified. \n\nHowever, breaking up a teenager's long-term relationship can be seen as harsh. The parent might have considered talking to the other parents first or giving the daughter a chance to address it herself. But given the situation described, especially the health-related interference and pressure, the parent's actions are likely motivated by concern for their child's safety. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the parent is not in the wrong. They have a right to protect their child from potentially toxic influences, even if it means separating the couple.\n"
