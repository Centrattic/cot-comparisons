I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's 3-year relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. The parent is concerned about the boyfriend's mother's behavior\u2014she's been acting like a mother figure, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging a mental health appointment without informing them, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt it was toxic and made the daughter break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's role. Parents have a duty to protect their children, especially minors. The boyfriend's mother's actions do seem intrusive. Taking charge of mental health appointments without the parent's knowledge could be concerning. Also, pressuring the daughter to move in is a big step for someone 16 years old. The parent might feel that the relationship is becoming manipulative, especially with the boyfriend supporting his mother's actions. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is a teenager, and relationships at that age can be a learning experience. The parent might be overstepping by ending the relationship, especially if the daughter was happy. But given the red flags mentioned, like the mother's behavior and lack of parental communication, the parent's intervention could be seen as protective. \n\nThe key points are the mother's overstepping, the daughter's mental health being handled without the parent, and the pressure to move in. These are serious concerns. The parent's decision might be justified to protect their child from potential manipulation or harm. However, it's also possible that the parent could have approached the situation differently, like talking to the boyfriend's family first before breaking them up. But considering the described actions, the parent might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
