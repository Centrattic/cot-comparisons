I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent is concerned about the boyfriend's mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, the mother of the boyfriend is acting like a parent, calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging a therapy appointment without informing the parent. That's a big red flag. Parents have a duty to protect their children from manipulative or harmful influences, even if the child is in a relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's support of his mother's actions is also a problem. If the mother and son are pressuring the daughter to move in with them, that's another red flag. The parent is worried about the daughter's safety and the toxic dynamics. \n\nWhile it's true that the daughter is a teenager and relationships can be a learning experience, the level of interference from the boyfriend's mother and the son's involvement in it crosses into potentially harmful territory. The parent is acting to protect their child from what they perceive as a manipulative and unsafe situation. \n\nIn many cases, parents do step in when they feel their child is in a harmful relationship, even if the child doesn't see it that way. The key here is the parent's reasonable concern for their child's well-being. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent is acting in their child's best interest based on observed concerning behavior."
