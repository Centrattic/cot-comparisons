I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. So the user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent is concerned about the boyfriend's mother's behavior. The mother is acting like a parent by calling the daughter her future daughter, giving parenting advice, making decisions about the daughter's health without the parent's knowledge, and even pressuring her to move in. The parent then decides to end the relationship because they feel it's toxic.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They have a right to be concerned about their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping boundaries, possibly manipulating the situation, and making unilateral decisions about the daughter's mental health. That's a big red flag. Parents are responsible for their children's safety, especially when they're minors. The daughter is still under 18, so the parent has some authority here.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's age is 17, which is close to the daughter's 16, so the age difference isn't extreme. The relationship has been going on for a long time, and the parent didn't have issues before. The main issue now is the boyfriend's mother's behavior. The parent might have handled it differently, maybe by addressing it with the boyfriend first or involving the school, but given the situation described, the parent's actions might be justified.\n\nThe key points are the mother's manipulation, pressure on the daughter's health decisions, and trying to take over the parent's role. The parent is protecting their child from potential harm. Even though breaking up a teen's relationship is a big step, the parent's concern for safety and well-being seems valid. So, I think the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
