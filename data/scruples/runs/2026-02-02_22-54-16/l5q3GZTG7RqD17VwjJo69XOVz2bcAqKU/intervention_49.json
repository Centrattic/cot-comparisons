I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 16-year-old daughter dating a 17-year-old boy for over three years. The parent is happy with the relationship but now has some concerns about the boyfriend's mother. The boy's mom is acting like a mother figure to the daughter, making comments about how she'll be a better mom once they get married, and even arranging medical appointments for the daughter without the parent's knowledge. Also, there's pressure for the daughter to move in with them. The parent then breaks them up because of these red flags.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The main issue here is whether the parent overstepped by breaking up the relationship. The parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior does sound concerning\u2014interfering in medical decisions, trying to take over the role of a parent, and pushing the daughter to move in. These could be signs of toxic behavior or manipulation. The parent isn't just reacting to their own feelings but to specific actions that might harm the daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is a minor, so the parent has a legal responsibility to protect her. The parent might feel that the boyfriend's family is overstepping, especially since the boyfriend is also involved in pressuring the daughter. The parent's decision to break up the relationship is based on safety concerns rather than just personal dislike. \n\nBut wait, is it the parent's place to end a relationship? Typically, parents might try to talk to the other parent or the child first. However, in this case, the parent might not have a good relationship with the boyfriend's mother and can't resolve the issue through communication. The parent could argue that the situation is a threat to the daughter's mental health and safety, so acting decisively is necessary.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the parent should have given the daughter more autonomy since she's 16. But since she's a minor, parents usually have that authority. Also, the boyfriend's mother's actions seem to be part of a pattern that's not healthy. The parent is trying to prevent potential harm.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's actions are driven by a legitimate concern for their child's well-being. The situation presents clear red flags, and the parent is taking steps to protect the daughter. So, the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong.\n"
