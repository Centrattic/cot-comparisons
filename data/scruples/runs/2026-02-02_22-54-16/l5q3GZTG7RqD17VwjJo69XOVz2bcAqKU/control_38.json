I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parents have been okay with the relationship until now. The main issues come from the boyfriend's mother. She's been acting like a mother figure, telling the daughter to think of her as her mom, calling her a future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised the daughter, and even arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend's mom also pressured the daughter about moving in with them. The parent felt this was overstepping and broke up the daughter's relationship with the boyfriend to protect her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They broke up the relationship because they felt the boyfriend and his mother were creating a toxic environment. The parent's reasoning is based on safety concerns and red flags. The boyfriend's mother's behavior seems intrusive and possibly manipulative. Arranging a mental health appointment without consulting the actual parent could be a problem, especially since the parents are the legal guardians. Pressuring a minor to move in with them might also be a boundary issue. The boyfriend supporting his mother's actions suggests he's involved in this dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's decision to end the relationship might be seen as overstepping. The daughter is 16, which is an age where parents might still have a significant role, but teenagers are developing independence. However, given the reported manipulative behaviors from the boyfriend's side, the parent's intervention could be justified as protective. The parent isn't necessarily trying to control the relationship but is responding to potential harm.\n\nLegal aspects: The parents have legal custody, so they have some authority in making decisions regarding their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions might infringe on that custody by taking over parental roles without permission. The pressure to move in could also be a legal concern if it's a form of coercion.\n\nEmotionally, the parent is acting out of concern. The daughter was feeling depressed, and the boyfriend's mother handled it without the parent's knowledge, which might indicate a lack of trust or a power struggle. The boyfriend supporting his mother against the parent's wishes could be seen as not respecting his partner's family boundaries.\n\nPossible arguments against the parent: Maybe the parent didn't give the daughter a chance to handle the situation herself, or the parent is being too controlling. But given the described manipulative tactics, it's hard to argue that the parent isn't acting in the child's best interest.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's actions seem justified given the red flags and potential harm from the boyfriend's family. The boyfriend's support of his mother's overreach adds to the concern. The parent is trying to protect their child, which is their right. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
