I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent who broke up their daughter's relationship is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over 3 years. The parent (aita) had no issues initially. But recently, the boyfriend's mom has been acting in strange ways. She's calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging a therapy appointment for the daughter without informing the parent. The mom also pressured the daughter to take medication if prescribed. The boyfriend supported this, and they're pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and toxic, so they told the daughter to break up with him.\n\nSo, the parent is concerned about the boyfriend's mother overstepping, acting as a surrogate parent, and possibly undermining their own role. The parent's actions were based on these red flags and concern for their daughter's safety. The boyfriend's involvement in this situation, supporting his mother's actions, adds to the parent's worry.\n\nI need to determine if the parent is in the wrong. The key points here are the parent's right to protect their child, the signs of potential manipulation or coercion from the boyfriend's family, and the age of the individuals involved. Since the daughter is a minor (16), the parent has a legal and ethical duty to ensure her safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem to encroach on the parent's role, which could be considered overstepping. The parent's decision to intervene might be seen as protective rather than overbearing, especially given the described behavior. The boyfriend's support of this situation might indicate that he's not a positive influence. \n\nHowever, breaking up a long-term relationship can have its own consequences. But given the parent's concerns about manipulation and safety, it's a judgment call. In many cases, parents have the right to step in if they believe their child is in a harmful situation, even if it means ending a relationship. The parent isn't necessarily overreacting here; the described actions do point to potential issues like emotional manipulation or control. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the parent is likely not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
