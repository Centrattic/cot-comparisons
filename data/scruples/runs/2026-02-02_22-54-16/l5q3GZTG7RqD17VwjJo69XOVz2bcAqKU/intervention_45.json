I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent broke up their daughter's three-year relationship because the boyfriend's mother was overstepping and being manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The mother (the author) initially supported the relationship. Then, the boyfriend's mother started acting like a mother figure, making critical comments about the author's parenting, arranging a mental health appointment without consulting the author, and pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The mother felt this was toxic and decided to end the relationship.\n\nSo, the author's main concern is the involvement of the boyfriend's mother, who seems to be trying to override the parent's role. The parent intervened to protect their daughter from what they see as manipulation. The boyfriend and his mother weren't consulting the parent and were pressuring the daughter. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, the daughter is a minor, so the parent has the right to be involved in her well-being. The boyfriend's mother taking charge of her mental health without the parent's knowledge could be problematic, especially if the daughter is under the parent's legal custody. The parent's decision might be seen as protective rather than interfering, given the circumstances.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, parents have a duty to safeguard their children from harmful situations. If there are clear signs of manipulation or toxic behavior from the other family, stepping in makes sense. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions might indicate he's not helping the situation, which adds to the parent's concerns.\n\nI need to check if there's any cultural or social context I'm missing. In some cases, parents might be more hands-off, but when there's a threat to the child's safety or mental health, intervention is justified. The key here is the parent acting in the child's best interest based on observed red flags.\n\nAlso, the daughter might feel caught between her parents and the boyfriend's family. The parent's approach could be seen as necessary to prevent further emotional harm. The boyfriend's mother's actions, like arranging appointments and pressuring the daughter, could be considered overreach, especially if they're undermining the parent's authority.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's actions seem to be in response to protect their daughter from potential harm, not out of jealousy or unnecessary interference. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
