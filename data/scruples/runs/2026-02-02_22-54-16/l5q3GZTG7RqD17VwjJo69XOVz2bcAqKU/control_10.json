I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent hasn't had issues before but recently found out about the boyfriend's mother acting overly involved, even to the point of pressuring the daughter to move in and taking control of her mental health decisions without notifying the parent. The parent confronted the mother, who then told her son, who in turn criticized the daughter. The parent feels the situation is toxic and has asked the daughter to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The daughter is a minor, so parents have a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's mother crossing boundaries by making decisions about the daughter's mental health and family dynamics is concerning. Stepparents or other adults in a relationship shouldn't replace or undermine a parent's role. The parent's concern about safety and well-being is valid here.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's support of his mother's actions might indicate a lack of respect for the daughter's boundaries. The parent's role is to safeguard their child from potential manipulation or harm. While the parent might not want to interfere, when there are clear red flags involving another adult, it's reasonable to act. The answer should be that the parent is not in the wrong (B) because they're protecting their child from a potentially harmful situation.\n"
