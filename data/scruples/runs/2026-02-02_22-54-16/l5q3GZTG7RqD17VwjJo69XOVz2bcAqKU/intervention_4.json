I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent initially supported the relationship but now has concerns because the boyfriend's mother is acting overly involved. The mother-in-law is calling the daughter her \"future daughter,\" criticizing how the parent raised her, and even arranging mental health appointments without informing the parent. Plus, there's pressure to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and breaks up the relationship.\n\nThe parent's main reasons are safety concerns and the mother's overstepping. The key points here are the mother's behavior, which seems overbearing and possibly manipulative. The parent's actions are based on protecting their child from what they perceive as a toxic situation. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent has a responsibility to ensure her well-being. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions is another red flag. \n\nLegally, the parent isn't wrong to intervene if they believe their child is in a harmful situation. The mother's actions could be considered overstepping boundaries, and the pressure on the daughter to move in raises concerns about exploitation. The parent's decision is driven by their role as a guardian. There's no indication the parent acted out of jealousy or without valid reasons. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
