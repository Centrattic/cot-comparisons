I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The scenario involves a 16-year-old girl dating a 17-year-old boy for three years. The parent initially had no issues but then noticed concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother. The mother is acting like a mother figure, making critical comments about the parent's parenting, arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge, pressuring medication, and encouraging the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and a threat to their daughter's safety, so they broke up the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent discovered these red flags and felt they were endangering their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping, taking a parental role without consent, and possibly manipulating the daughter. The boy is supporting this, which adds to the concern. The parent's primary responsibility is their child's safety and well-being. If they genuinely believe the relationship is harmful, their intervention might be justified.\n\nHowever, breaking up a relationship is a serious action. The parent should ideally talk to the daughter first, express concerns, and see if she's aware or agrees. But in this case, the daughter was already feeling depressed and the mother-in-law was involved without the parent's knowledge. The parent might have felt immediate action was necessary to prevent further harm. The situation seems to involve manipulation and potential emotional abuse.\n\nLegally, the parent has a duty to protect their minor child. The boyfriend's mother's actions could be seen as overreaching and possibly interfering with the relationship between the parent and child. The parent's decision might be based on valid concerns, even if they didn't consult the daughter first. However, ideally, a parent would involve the child in such decisions if possible. But given the urgency of the situation and the daughter's mental health being affected, the parent's actions could be seen as protective rather than overbearing.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent is trying to prevent harm and protect their child from what they perceive as a toxic and manipulative influence. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is indeed problematic. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
