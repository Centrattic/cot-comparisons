I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent has been okay with the relationship up until now. The main issue seems to be the boyfriend's mother getting too involved. She's calling herself the future mother, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without informing the parent. The boyfriend is also pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and a threat to their relationship with their child, so they told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the mother's overstepping and the boyfriend's support of it. The parent is worried about their daughter's safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mom is acting as if she's a substitute parent, which can be really problematic. Parents usually have a right to be concerned if someone else is trying to take over their parental role. The fact that the daughter is being pressured to move in with the boyfriend and his mom adds another layer of concern, especially given their ages. The parent is stepping in because they see red flags. It's their responsibility to protect their child from potential manipulation or harm. Since the boyfriend is involved in this behavior, the parent's decision to end the relationship seems justified. So, the answer is probably B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
