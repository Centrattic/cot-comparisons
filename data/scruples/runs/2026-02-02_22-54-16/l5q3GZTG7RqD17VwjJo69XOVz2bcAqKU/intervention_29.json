I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent did the right thing here. So, the daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent hasn't had any issues before. Now, the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, even saying she's the future mother-in-law and taking control of the daughter's healthcare decisions. She's also pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent confronts this, and the boyfriend gets mad at the daughter for telling. The parent then tells the daughter to break up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's role. They're responsible for their child's well-being. The boyfriend's mom's actions sound like they're overstepping. Taking control of medical decisions without the parent's knowledge is a problem. Also, the pressure to move in could be a sign of manipulation or trying to take over the parent's role. The boyfriend supporting this might mean he's not protecting his girlfriend from his mom's influence.\n\nThe parent is concerned about the toxicity and safety. Breaking up the relationship might be a protective measure. But is it right for the parent to force a breakup? The daughter is 16, so she's still a minor, and parents have some authority in their decisions. However, the parent is acting on their own judgment, not necessarily following any legal procedures. They might be reacting to red flags that others might not see. But is it their place to end the relationship? It's a gray area. On one hand, protecting the child is important. On the other hand, the daughter might feel her autonomy is being taken away.\n\nIn some cases, parents intervene when they see harmful relationships. The key factors here are the mother-in-law's manipulative behavior and the boyfriend's support of it. The parent's actions could be seen as necessary to protect their daughter from emotional harm. So, the answer might be B, the parent is not in the wrong because they're trying to protect their child from a potentially harmful influence.\n"
