I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship with her 17-year-old boyfriend. The daughter is 16 and they've been dating for over three years, which is a long time for teenagers. The parent has generally been okay with the relationship, but now there are issues with the boyfriend's mother acting in a controlling way. She's been telling the daughter to think of her as her mother, making decisions about her mental health without the parent's knowledge, and even pressuring the daughter to move in with them.\n\nSo, the parent is stepping in because they see red flags and are worried about their daughter's safety. The question is whether the parent is right to do so. On one hand, the daughter is a minor, and parents are responsible for her well-being. The boyfriend's mom's behavior sounds manipulative and overstepping, especially making medical decisions for the daughter. The parent is acting to protect their child, which is a natural instinct. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is 16, which is an age where she's starting to gain more independence. But the boyfriend's mother's actions seem to be taking that independence too far. The parent might be overreacting if the boyfriend is supportive and the daughter is happy, but the mother-in-law's behavior includes elements like undermining the parent's role and possibly enabling or participating in emotional manipulation. \n\nThe parent's decision could be seen as necessary to prevent harm. However, it's important to consider if the parent gave the daughter a chance to express her side. If the parent made the decision without the daughter's input, maybe that's a problem, but the scenario describes the parent acting based on their own observations and the daughter's expressed feelings of depression. The boyfriend's mom's actions might be a form of emotional abuse or parental alienation. \n\nSo, the parent is probably not in the wrong because they're trying to protect their child from a potentially harmful situation. The key factors are the daughter's age, the controlling behavior of the boyfriend's mother, and the parent's concern for safety. The answer should be B.\n"
