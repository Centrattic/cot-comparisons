I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent, the author, is the one who broke up their daughter's three-year relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old, and they've been together a long time. The parent wasn't against the relationship initially. The problem arises with the boyfriend's mom. She's been acting like a mother figure, saying things like \"think of me as your mother\" and even arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without the parent's knowledge. The mom is also trying to pressure the daughter to move in with them. The author feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up with him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parent's actions are based on concerns for their daughter's safety and well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is definitely concerning\u2014overstepping boundaries, making decisions without the parent, and trying to replace them in the daughter's life. The boyfriend is also involved in this by pressuring the daughter and not supporting the parent's concerns.\n\nIn typical parent-teen relationships, the parent has the right to intervene if they perceive a threat to their child's safety. Even though the daughter is a teenager and the relationship is long-term, the parent's role is to protect. The boyfriend's mother's actions seem manipulative and could undermine the parent's authority. The parent isn't just reacting to normal teenage behavior but to a situation where an adult is trying to take over a parental role, which is a red flag. The author's decision to end the relationship is likely aimed at protecting their daughter from potential emotional harm. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here.\n"
