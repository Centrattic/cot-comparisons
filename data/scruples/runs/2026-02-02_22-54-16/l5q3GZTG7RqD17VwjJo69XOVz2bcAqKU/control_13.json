I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for three years. The parent has generally been okay with the relationship. But recently, the boyfriend's mother has been acting strangely, like trying to take over as a mother figure, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging a therapy appointment without informing the parent, and even pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they told the daughter to break up with the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parent's actions are justified. The key issue here is the parent's concern about their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is definitely concerning. She's stepping into a parental role, which could be a form of emotional manipulation. The parent is acting on these red flags to protect their daughter. In most cases, parents have the right to intervene when they believe their child is in a harmful situation, especially if there's evidence of manipulation or undue influence. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the concern, suggesting a possible toxic dynamic.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the parent could have approached the situation differently, like talking to the other parent or involving the daughter more in the decision-making. But given the circumstances\u2014especially the daughter's mental health being managed without the parent's knowledge\u2014it's a valid reason for concern. The parent's primary responsibility is to ensure their child's safety and well-being. Since there are clear red flags, the parent's intervention seems justified. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
