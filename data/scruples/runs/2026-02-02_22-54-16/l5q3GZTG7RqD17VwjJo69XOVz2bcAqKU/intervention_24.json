I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is a 16-year-old girl's parent, and the boyfriend is 17. They're been dating for three years, and the parent wasn't initially worried. But now there's this situation where the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure in a concerning way. She's telling the daughter to call her mom, is critical of how the parent raised her, and even took matters into her own hands regarding the daughter's mental health\u2014arranged an appointment without the parent's knowledge. The boyfriend is supporting this, and they're pushing the daughter to move in with them.\n\nThe parent feels like the boyfriend's mom is trying to replace them and that the relationship is toxic. So they broke up the couple to protect their daughter. The question is whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They observed behaviors that they find alarming\u2014parental overreach from the boyfriend's mom, potential manipulation, and pressure on the daughter. The parent's decision is based on concern for their child's well-being, which is a common reason for intervening. However, the daughter is 16, a minor, and while parents have a right to make decisions for their children, the line can be blurry when it comes to relationships.\n\nBut the boyfriend's mom's actions seem highly inappropriate. Parents are not supposed to interfere that much in their child's partner's life, especially a minor's. If the mother is acting as a surrogate parent and undermining the actual parent, that's a red flag. The boyfriend enabling this could also be problematic.\n\nThe parent's main concern is the daughter's safety and mental health. If there's evidence of manipulation or coercion, then stepping in is justified. However, the parent might have considered other steps before breaking up the relationship, like talking to the other parent or providing counseling. But given the situation described, the parent might feel those steps are not viable if the other parent is hostile.\n\nSo, the parent's actions are driven by protecting their daughter from what they perceive as a toxic influence. While it's a tough call, the parent's intent is to safeguard their child. Unless there's no basis for their concerns, which there seems to be, the parent isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
