I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's three-year relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old, and the parent has some concerns about the boyfriend's mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, the parent noticed the boyfriend's mom acting overly involved. She calls the daughter her future daughter, critiques how the parent raised her, and even arranges a therapy appointment without consulting the parent. The mom also pressures the daughter to move in with them. The parent felt this was manipulative and a safety risk, so they told the daughter to break up.\n\nHmm, the parent's actions are based on genuine concerns. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping, possibly trying to take over the parenting role. The parent isn't just being overprotective; they have specific red flags. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has a responsibility to protect her. The boyfriend's support of his mom's actions adds to the problem. Breaking up to prevent potential harm isn't unreasonable. The parent isn't in the wrong here because their actions are in the daughter's best interest. So answer B.\n"
