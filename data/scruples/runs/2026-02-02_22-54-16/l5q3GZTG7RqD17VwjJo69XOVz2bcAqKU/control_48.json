I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's three-year relationship with her boyfriend. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17, and they're both in high school.\n\nThe parent's main concerns are about the boyfriend's mother acting overly involved in their daughter's life. The mother is calling the daughter her \"future daughter,\" criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment without informing the parent. The boyfriend's mother seems to be taking a very controlling role, pressuring the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend is supporting this behavior. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, leading them to ask the daughter to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the parent acted correctly. The parent is a guardian of a minor, so their primary responsibility is the daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions do cross boundaries\u2014interfering in the daughter's personal decisions, mental health care, and even trying to undermine the parent. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions is a red flag, as he should be respecting his partner's autonomy and her parent's role.\n\nThe parent isn't acting out of jealousy or without cause. They've observed several concerning behaviors that suggest a toxic dynamic. The daughter is still a teenager, and her judgment might not be fully mature, so a parent stepping in when there's evidence of manipulation is reasonable. The parent's decision is based on protecting their child from potential harm, which is a valid parental duty.\n\nHowever, breaking up a long-term relationship can be seen as overstepping if not done carefully. But given the described manipulative behaviors and the parent's concerns about safety, it's a protective measure. The key here is whether there was a justifiable reason. The parent has documented multiple red flags, which a reasonable person would consider concerning. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
