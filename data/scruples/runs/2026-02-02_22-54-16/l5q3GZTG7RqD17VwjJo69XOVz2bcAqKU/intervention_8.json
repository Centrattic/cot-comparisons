I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who broke up their daughter's three-year relationship is in the wrong. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old. The parent didn't have issues before but now there's this stepmom involved.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mom is acting like a mother figure, calling the daughter her future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging mental health appointments without informing the parent. The mom is also pushing the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and a threat to their relationship with their child, so they broke up the relationship to protect their daughter.\n\nI need to consider the parent's actions. They stepped in because they observed concerning behavior from the boyfriend's mother. The parent had a valid concern about the daughter's well-being, especially since the boyfriend's mom was taking a controlling role. The parent didn't just act on a hunch but based on specific red flags like unsupervised appointments and pressure to move out. The parent's intention was to protect their child, not to interfere without cause. The boyfriend's support of his mother's actions adds to the toxicity. \n\nHowever, breaking up a relationship between teenagers isn't a decision to take lightly. The parent should have considered other solutions first, like talking to the boyfriend's mother or the school, but in this case, the urgency of possible manipulation and mental health concerns might justify their actions. The key is whether the parent had reasonable grounds. Since there were multiple red flags and the parent felt threatened in their parental role, their action could be seen as protective rather than controlling. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The parent isn't in the wrong because they acted to protect their child from a potentially toxic influence.\n"
