I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent breaking up their 16-year-old daughter's three-year relationship with a 17-year-old boy because of the boy's mother's behavior. The mother has been acting like a surrogate parent, criticizing the parent's parenting, arranging a mental health appointment without consulting them, and pressuring the daughter to move in. The parent feels this is toxic and manipulative, so they made the daughter break up with the boy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the parent acted wrongly. The key points here are the parent's concern for their daughter's well-being. The boyfriend's mother is overstepping her role, possibly crossing boundaries by taking control of the daughter's mental health decisions and trying to replace the parent. The parent's action was to protect their daughter from what they perceive as a harmful influence. \n\nIn many cases, parents have the right to intervene if they believe their child is in a dangerous or unhealthy situation, especially when the child is a minor. The daughter is 16, so she's still under legal guardianship. The parent's main concern is safety and emotional well-being. The boyfriend's mother's actions\u2014like arranging a mental health appointment without informing the parent and pressuring the daughter\u2014could be seen as manipulative or controlling. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent could have addressed the issues with the boyfriend's mother first before breaking up the relationship. But given that the daughter is reporting feelings of depression and being manipulated, the parent's immediate action might be justified as a protective measure. \n\nAnother angle is the daughter's agency. Since she's a minor, the parents have a legal and moral duty to protect her. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is indeed concerning, and the parent might have felt that the relationship was becoming a tool for the mother's control. The boyfriend supporting this behavior adds to the red flags. \n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014the parent's intent to protect, the daughter's age, and the manipulative actions by the boyfriend's mother\u2014it seems the parent was acting in good faith. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
