I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for breaking up their daughter's three-year relationship. The daughter is 16, the boyfriend 17. The parent found out that the boyfriend's mom has been acting like a mother figure, calling her a future daughter, criticizing the parent's parenting, and even arranging mental health appointments without the parent's knowledge. The mom also pressured the daughter to move in with them, and the boyfriend supported this, making the parent feel the relationship is toxic and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. The daughter is a minor, so the parent has the right to be concerned about her well-being. The boyfriend's mother stepping into a parental role is a red flag. Parents aren't supposed to interfere in their child's relationships, but when the other parent is involved in a way that's undermining the girl's own parent, it's a different situation. The mother arranging a mental health appointment without informing the daughter's parent could be seen as overstepping. Also, pressuring a minor to move in is a big issue. The boyfriend's support of this behavior might indicate he's part of the problem, not just a victim.\n\nBut wait, is the parent justified in breaking up the relationship? It's their daughter's choice, even if they're worried. But minors can't make all decisions on their own. The parent's role is to protect. The boyfriend's mom's actions could be manipulative, creating a toxic environment. The parent might be acting in the daughter's best interest. However, the parent should probably talk to the daughter first, explain the concerns, and maybe involve authorities if necessary. Breaking up the relationship directly might be overstepping, but if the parent feels the daughter is in danger, it's a protective measure. The key is whether the parent's actions were reasonable given the evidence of manipulation and pressure. I think the parent is not in the wrong because they're trying to protect their child from a potentially harmful dynamic.\n"
