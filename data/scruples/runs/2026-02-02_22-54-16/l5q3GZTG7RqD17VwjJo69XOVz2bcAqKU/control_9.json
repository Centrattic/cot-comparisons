I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're at fault for breaking up their daughter's relationship. The daughter is 16, dating a 17-year-old for over three years. The parent initially supported the relationship. Now, the boyfriend's mother is getting involved in a way that's concerning. She's acting like a mother figure, making decisions about the daughter's mental health without consulting the parent, and even pressuring the daughter to move in with them. The parent feels this is manipulative and a threat to their relationship with their daughter.\n\nFirst, the parent's main concern is the stepmother's behavior. The mother is overstepping her role by taking control of the daughter's mental health treatment without the parent's knowledge. That's a red flag because mental health decisions typically involve the parent or guardian. Also, the mother is trying to replace the daughter's mother, which could be emotionally damaging. The boyfriend's support of this behavior is another issue. The parent is acting out of concern for their daughter's well-being and safety.\n\nIn terms of the parent's action, they broke up the relationship to protect their daughter from what they perceive as a toxic and manipulative situation. Since the daughter is a minor, the parent has the right and responsibility to make decisions in their child's best interest. The boyfriend's family's actions could be considered inappropriate intrusion into the daughter's life. The parent isn't acting out of jealousy but out of genuine concerns for their daughter's mental and emotional health. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
