I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe parent, the author, is a mother whose daughter is dating a boy a year older, both in high school, and have been dating for three years. The mother hasn't had issues before. The boyfriend's mother has been acting in a way that's concerning. She's calling the daughter \"future daughter,\" claiming she should think of her as a mother, criticizing the mother's parenting, and even arranging a mental health appointment for the daughter without informing the mother. The boyfriend's mother also pressured the daughter about moving in with them. When the author confronted the boyfriend's mother, she told her son to berate the daughter for telling the mother. The author then decided to break them up because she felt the relationship was toxic and manipulative, fearing for her daughter's safety.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking them up. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's role. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children, especially minors. Even though the daughter is 16, she's still a minor, and the boyfriend's mother is an adult. The mother's actions seem to overstep boundaries. She's taking on a parental role, which could be a form of manipulation or control. Arranging a mental health appointment without the parent's knowledge is concerning. It might be well-intentioned, but it's also a violation of the parent's authority and the daughter's autonomy.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's support of his mother's actions suggests that he's not protecting the daughter's interests. If the mother is pressuring the daughter to move in with them and the boyfriend is okay with that, that's a red flag. The parent has every right to be concerned about her daughter's safety and well-being. The mother's actions could be undermining the parent-child relationship, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of the parent's decision to break them up, it's a drastic step. But given the circumstances, if there's evidence of manipulation and potential harm, a parent might feel justified in stepping in. The key points here are the mother's overstepping, the boyfriend's support, and the parent acting in the daughter's best interest. However, the parent didn't consult the daughter first, which could be an issue. But considering the urgency of the situation and the potential risks, the parent's actions might be seen as protective.\n\nI need to check if there are any other factors. The daughter is 16, so she's still under her mother's care. The boyfriend's mother's behavior is inappropriate, and the parent has a duty to intervene when there's a threat to the child's well-being. The answer likely leans towards the parent not being in the wrong because the situation involves protective parental actions against a potentially harmful third party.\n"
