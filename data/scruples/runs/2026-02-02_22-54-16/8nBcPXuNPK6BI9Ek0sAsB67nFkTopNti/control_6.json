After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In some cultures, expecting a woman to immediately inform the partner might be the norm, but in others, seeking family support first is common. The author mentioned she took a few days to decide, discussing with her family. She did tell her boyfriend eventually, and he was okay about the pregnancy but upset about the order of disclosure.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is based on feeling excluded from the decision-making process. He views the child as a shared responsibility, so his perspective is valid. However, the author argues that it's her body and her choice, and she sought advice from her family, who are also mothers. This is a classic conflict between individual autonomy and mutual decision-making in a relationship.\n\nI need to check if there's any legal or ethical obligation for her to inform her partner first. Legally, there might not be, but ethically, it's about mutual respect and communication. The key here is whether the boyfriend was kept in the loop. The author did tell him after some time, but he felt left out. \n\nThe question is whether her actions were wrong. The answer depends on the relationship's expectations. If they had prior discussions about such scenarios, maybe she breached an unspoken agreement. However, if there were no prior discussions, her actions might be seen as within her rights. The fact that she did inform him eventually and he accepted the news suggests that while his feelings are hurt, she isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: her right to seek family support versus his right to be involved. The answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong because she didn't hide the pregnancy and communicated eventually, even if not immediately. However, some might argue that involving her partner first would have been more considerate. But since there's no clear right or wrong, and she didn't lie, the answer could be B (No).\n"
