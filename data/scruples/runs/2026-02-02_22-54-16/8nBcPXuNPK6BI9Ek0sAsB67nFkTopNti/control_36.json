After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then told her mom and sister. She mentions she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would take it, so she discussed it with her family for a few days. They both decided to keep the baby, but when she told the boyfriend, he was annoyed because she told her family first and made decisions without him. The author thinks she's not in the wrong because it's her choice and her family has experience as mothers.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider different angles. On one hand, the boyfriend might feel left out or not involved in the decision-making process. The situation involves a major life decision that affects both partners. The author did consult her family, which could be her support system, but the boyfriend might have expected to be part of the discussion from the start.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that it's her choice and her family's support is important. Also, she didn't tell the boyfriend immediately because she was unsure how he'd react. She did involve him eventually and they decided to keep the baby together. The key points here are communication and mutual decision-making in a relationship. \n\nIn many relationships, major decisions like pregnancy are considered joint responsibilities. By not informing the boyfriend first, the author might have overlooked his role in the decision. However, her intention was to seek support from her family, especially since they are mothers themselves. It's possible she felt more comfortable getting their advice first, especially if she was uncertain about his reaction.\n\nThere's a balance between seeking family support and including the partner. The boyfriend's annoyance is about being excluded from the initial decision-making. The author might argue that consulting her family was necessary for her own emotional support and decision-making process. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, as she did involve her family and eventually the boyfriend. However, the boyfriend might feel that his partnership was not respected by not being the first to know and part of the early discussions. \n\nIn some perspectives, the right answer might depend on cultural or personal relationship norms. But generally, major life decisions should be mutual. The author did involve her partner eventually, but didn't include him in the initial decision. The key issue is the timing and the process of communication. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be either A or B depending on how one weighs the importance of including the partner vs. seeking family support. But since the author did involve her partner in the end and the decision wasn't made without him entirely, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). Alternatively, if the expectation in the relationship is that the partner should be the first to know, then A. But without more context, I think the author isn't in the wrong because she had her reasons and did involve the boyfriend later.\n"
