After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant and told her mom and sister first. She took a few days to think about the decision with her family and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together. The author thinks she was right to involve her family, especially since they're mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication in a relationship and the expectations of shared decision-making. The boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be part of the decision-making process for their child. The author's defense is that it's her choice and that her family could provide support.\n\nBut in a relationship, major life decisions like having a child usually require mutual agreement. The author made a significant decision without including her partner first, which could be seen as not respecting his role in the partnership. However, she did involve her family, which she might have felt was necessary for support. \n\nThe boyfriend's point is valid because pregnancy and parenting are joint responsibilities. Even though the author has the right to make certain choices, withholding information from her partner could lead to feelings of being left out. The author might not be entirely wrong if her intention was to seek support, but the timing and approach could have been better. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the boyfriend's reaction is understandable. The author's actions might be seen as a misstep in not including him from the start, even if her family was involved. Therefore, she might be in the wrong. But if the question is about whether she's definitely in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. However, the boyfriend's valid viewpoint suggests that the author should have included him first, making her partially at fault. So the answer might be A.\n"
