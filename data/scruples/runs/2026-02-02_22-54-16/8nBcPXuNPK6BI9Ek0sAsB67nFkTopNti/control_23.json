He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant and told her mother and sister immediately after the second positive test. She was unsure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think over and discuss with her family. Then she decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was annoyed because she didn't tell him first and made decisions without him. He argued that it's their child and they should have discussed it together. The author sees her family's support as important since they are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the timing of the disclosure, the decision-making process, and the boyfriend's reaction. The boyfriend feels left out, which is valid because pregnancy affects both partners. But the author had her reasons, like seeking support from her family and wanting to process her own feelings first.\n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are crucial. However, when a major life decision is involved, both partners should ideally be involved. The author might have acted out of self-preservation or seeking immediate support, but not including her boyfriend immediately could have been hurtful. On the other hand, she might not have known how he'd react and wanted to stabilize her own thoughts first. \n\nBut considering the boyfriend's perspective, he might feel that the decision was made without him, even if it was his own child. The author's decision to consult her family first isn't inherently wrong, but maybe she should have communicated her intention to involve her family before making that choice. Alternatively, she could have told her boyfriend and her family around the same time if possible. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were for her own processing, but the boyfriend's feelings are valid. However, the situation might depend on cultural norms, relationship dynamics, and how the couple typically handles decisions. Since the author decided to keep the child and the boyfriend was informed, maybe the main issue is the order of disclosure. \n\nI think the answer isn't straightforward. But in many contexts, both partners should be involved in such decisions. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because of the need for support, but the boyfriend's reaction is understandable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she made the decision after consulting her family and then informed her boyfriend, but didn't include him during the decision-making, maybe she is partially at fault. But the answer depends on whether the decision was hers to make independently. Since pregnancy directly affects her body, her decisions might be her own, but the child is theirs together. \n\nSo, balancing both perspectives, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. Her family's support is important, and she had good reasons. The boyfriend's reaction is valid but perhaps the author could have found a middle ground. The answer is probably B (No), but I need to check if there's a standard expectation here. In many cases, people might expect both partners to be informed together, but the author's actions were also about seeking support. Given that, maybe the answer is B.\n"
