After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. The key points here are the timeline and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author found out she was pregnant. She took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She mentions she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think it over and discussed it with her family. Then she decided to keep the pregnancy. When she told her boyfriend, he was annoyed because she had already told her family and made decisions without him.\n\nThe boyfriend's main issue is that he feels they should have made the decision together since it's their child. The author counters that it's her choice and she doesn't feel wrong for talking to her family, especially since they are both mothers themselves.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Relationships often require communication and shared decision-making, especially regarding major life events like pregnancy. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he might feel left out of the process, which is important for partnership. However, the author's actions might be seen as seeking support from her family, which is natural. \n\nBut, by not including her boyfriend in the initial decision-making, even if she was uncertain, she might have breached the trust or partnership. However, her reasoning is that it's her body and she had to decide first. There's a balance between individual autonomy and shared responsibility in a relationship. \n\nThe answer hinges on cultural values and relationship norms. Some might side with the boyfriend because major life decisions should be mutual, others might support the author's right to seek family support first. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the boyfriend's valid reaction suggests she might share some responsibility, but the situation is nuanced. However, given the information, the answer could lean towards the author not being entirely in the wrong because seeking family advice is common, but there's room for improvement in communication. But the boyfriend's perspective is also important. I think the answer is that she's not in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation where both could be seen as having valid points.\n"
