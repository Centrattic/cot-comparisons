After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend found out later and was annoyed. The question is whether she did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author felt the need to discuss with her family, especially since they are both mothers. She took time to decide and eventually told the boyfriend. He was upset because he thought they should have made the decision together since it's their child. \n\nSo, on one hand, the boyfriend's reaction makes sense. Being a parent is a shared responsibility, so it's reasonable for him to feel included in the decision-making process. The author did wait a few days to think it over, which might have been a good idea, but not involving him during that time could be an issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt that her family's input was necessary, especially her mother and sister who have experience as mothers. She might have been processing the news and considering her options, which is a personal decision. \n\nIs there a cultural or social norm here? In some cases, women might lean on their families for support, especially in matters like pregnancy. But the boyfriend's perspective is also valid because it's their child. \n\nI need to check if there's any prior context mentioned, but the summary doesn't give more info about their relationship dynamics. If they're a committed couple, then sharing the news with him promptly would be expected. The author waited a few days to discuss with her family, which might have been a protective measure, but the boyfriend's feeling of being left out is valid. \n\nHowever, the author did mention that she told her boyfriend eventually, and he was okay with it. The main issue is the order of disclosure and the decision-making process. Since it's their child, both partners should have a say, so the author didn't involve him in the decision, which he found annoying. \n\nSo, is she wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the decision was hers alone, maybe not. But since it's a shared life event, not including him could be seen as a mistake. The key is whether the decision required mutual agreement. \n\nI think the answer would be that she's not entirely in the wrong because sharing with family for support is understandable, but the boyfriend's feelings are valid too. However, according to the options given (A or B), the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author had her reasons and the boyfriend's reaction is valid but doesn't necessarily make her wrong.\n"
