After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant and immediately told her mom and sister after getting a second positive test. She waited a few days to decide whether to keep the baby, discussing it with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because she told her family first and made decisions without him. He argued that it's their child, so they should have decided together. The author thinks her family, being mothers themselves, could help, and she doesn't feel wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down. The key points here are communication in a relationship, shared decision-making, and the dynamics between the author, her family, and her boyfriend.\n\nIn relationships, it's generally expected that major life decisions, especially those affecting both partners, are made together. Pregnancy is a significant life event that impacts both the woman and her partner. By telling her family first and making a decision without her boyfriend, the author may have overlooked his right to be involved in the decision-making process. The boyfriend's reaction is based on feeling excluded from a decision that he perceives as theirs as a couple.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that she was unsure how her boyfriend would react and needed time to process the news with her family. Her family's experience as mothers might have given her support. But even so, once she made the decision to keep the baby, she should have communicated with her boyfriend, especially since the decision affects him as well. The delay in telling him and involving her family first could be seen as not respecting his role in the relationship.\n\nBut then again, the author might have felt vulnerable or uncertain, and seeking support from her family is a natural response. However, in a committed relationship, major decisions usually require mutual discussion. The boyfriend's annoyance stems from the fact that he wasn't included in the process. Even if the author made the right choice for her, the method of involving her family first without her partner might be considered a misstep in communication.\n\nI need to consider cultural or societal norms. Some people might argue that it's reasonable for a woman to consult her family, especially in a sensitive matter. Others would say that in a partnership, both people should be involved. The key here is that the decision affects both of them. So while the author's actions are understandable, the boyfriend's perspective is valid because he's part of the equation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She had the right to seek support and make a decision, but by not including her boyfriend from the start, she might have breached the trust or expectation of shared decision-making. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't include her partner in the decision-making process, which is a crucial partnership aspect.\n"
