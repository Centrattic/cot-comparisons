After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author found out she was pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think things over and discussed it with her family before informing her boyfriend. The boyfriend was okay with the news but was annoyed that she told her family first and made the initial decision without him. He feels it should have been a joint decision since it's their child.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sequence of telling family vs. the partner and the boyfriend's reaction. The author argues that she had the right to consult her family, especially since they are mothers themselves, and that it's ultimately her choice. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. In many relationships, both partners are expected to be involved in major life decisions, especially something as significant as a pregnancy. However, the author had to make an initial decision quickly, which is understandable. She might have felt more comfortable discussing it with family first to process her own feelings before sharing with her partner.\n\nBut the boyfriend's perspective is valid too. He might feel that since the child is theirs, both should have discussed it together. The delay in informing him could lead to feelings of exclusion. However, the author's actions were in part to take time to decide, which isn't inherently wrong. The issue might be more about communication and expectations in their relationship rather than right or wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, she's not obligated to tell her partner before her family. However, in a relationship, mutual decision-making is important. The author might have acted in her best interest, but the boyfriend's feelings are also valid. It's a bit of a grey area. Some people might side with the author because she needed time and support from her family, while others might think the boyfriend had a right to be involved immediately.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but she might have made a relationship misstep. However, since she later told her boyfriend and they are moving forward, perhaps the main issue is the boyfriend's reaction rather than her actions. The answer might be B (No), because she isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives.\n"
