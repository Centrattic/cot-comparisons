After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the woman found out she was pregnant, did two tests, then told her mom and sister. She took a few days to think and discuss with her family before informing her boyfriend. When she told him, he was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child.\n\nSo, the main issue is the order of disclosure. The boyfriend wants joint decision-making, while the woman feels it's her choice and she consulted her family, who are mothers. The woman is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. In relationships, communication is key. Typically, major life decisions like pregnancy are considered joint responsibilities, so involving each other first makes sense. However, the woman might have felt the need to process the news with her family first, especially since they are experienced mothers. She might have wanted support or guidance before discussing with her boyfriend, which is understandable.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is valid because he feels left out of the decision-making process. Even if she took time to think, the initial decision to tell her family first without him could be seen as not considering his role in the situation. However, she did involve him eventually and they decided to keep the child together.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The woman's right to her own choices, especially regarding her body. 2) The expectation in a relationship for joint major decisions. 3) The boyfriend's valid feelings of being excluded. \n\nBut since she did involve her family, who are mothers, maybe she felt their input was necessary. However, in a committed relationship, the partner is also a key decision-maker. The woman might not be in the wrong because it's her body and her choice, but the boyfriend's reaction is also understandable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because the decision is hers to make, and she did involve her family. The boyfriend's reaction is more about the process and communication, but her actions don't necessarily make her wrong. However, there's room for better communication in the future.\n"
