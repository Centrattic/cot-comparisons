After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author found out she was pregnant and immediately told her mom and sister. She took a few days to process and discuss with her family before telling her boyfriend. When she did tell him, he was upset that she hadn't involved him first, arguing that it's their child and they should have made the decision together. The author defends her actions by saying it's her choice and that her mother and sister are also mothers, so they could provide support.\n\nSo, the key points here are: timing of the announcement, the reasons behind it, and the boyfriend's reaction. The boyfriend feels excluded, which is understandable because a pregnancy affects both partners. However, the author might feel that consulting her family first was necessary for emotional support and decision-making, especially if she was uncertain about how to proceed.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did eventually share the news with her boyfriend, even if it was after her family. The boyfriend's annoyance stems from feeling left out of the decision-making process. But the author might have felt that her family could offer immediate support and guidance, especially since they are both mothers. It's also possible she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so involving her family first could be a way to seek advice before making a joint decision.\n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong depends on cultural norms, the expectations of the relationship, and how both parties see their roles. If the couple had prior agreements about such situations, that would matter. But given the information here, she didn't keep it a secret from him; she just shared it with her family first. Both sides have valid points. The boyfriend's point about shared responsibility is important, but the author's need for support from her family is also valid.\n\nIn many cases, sharing news with family for support is a common practice. However, in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual decision-making. The author could have considered involving her boyfriend earlier if possible, but she did eventually include him. The fact that she considered his perspective and sees his point shows some willingness to collaborate. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, I think the author isn't entirely wrong. She acted in a way that prioritized her immediate support network, which can be reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction is valid too, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking family input first.\n"
