After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister she's pregnant before her boyfriend. She found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister first, waited a few days to decide, then told her boyfriend. He was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a woman, and pregnancy is a significant life event that affects both partners. She sought support from her family, who are mothers themselves, which makes sense for advice. However, her boyfriend felt left out of the decision-making process. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual decision-making. The author waited a few days to process and discuss with her family before informing her boyfriend. While she sees it as her choice, the boyfriend views the pregnancy as a shared responsibility. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to feel involved in major decisions. Even though the author had the final say, not including her boyfriend in the initial steps might have caused him to feel excluded. However, she did eventually share the decision with him, and he was okay with it. \n\nIs she wrong for not consulting him first? It depends on the relationship's norms. Some couples prefer to handle such matters together from the start, while others might support individual decision-making. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he believes in joint decisions. The author's actions might not be \"wrong\" per se, but they may have been a misstep in communication. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether prioritizing family advice before the partner is considered a mistake. Since the boyfriend was a co-parent, excluding him from the initial process could be seen as a breach in partnership. However, the author doesn't feel wrong because it's her body and choice. The situation is complex, but the boyfriend's feelings are legitimate. The answer might lean towards A (Yes), she's in the wrong, but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, it could be B (No), because it's her decision. But maybe the consensus is that partners should discuss such things together. \n\nWait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend felt wronged, and the author didn't consider his perspective, then maybe she is. But the author had her reasons. It's a bit of a gray area. In many cases, involving both partners early is ideal. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the decision was hers to make, then B. Hmm. I think the answer is A because the boyfriend's perspective is valid and the author didn't include him in the initial steps, which could be seen as a mistake in partnership.\n"
