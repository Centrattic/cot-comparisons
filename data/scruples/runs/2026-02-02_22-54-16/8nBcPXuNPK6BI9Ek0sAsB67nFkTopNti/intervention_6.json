After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together. The author thinks she's not in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the author found out she's pregnant, told her family first, then told her boyfriend later. The boyfriend is upset because he wanted to be involved in the decision-making process. The author argues that it's her choice and she consulted her family, who are mothers themselves, which might have been for support.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, communication is key. When a major life decision like pregnancy is involved, both partners usually expect to be part of the discussion. However, the author might have felt uncertain about how her boyfriend would react, so she sought support from her family first. That could be understandable if she was anxious or needed reassurance.\n\nBut the boyfriend's perspective is also important. He might feel left out or that his input wasn't considered. The author did tell him eventually, but the timing and process might have caused the issue. The question is whether it was wrong to inform her family first. It's possible that while the author had her reasons, the way she handled the communication could have been improved by including her boyfriend from the start. However, there's also a case for her right to make decisions about her body, especially in early decision-making stages.\n\nIn many relationships, shared decisions are expected, but each partner's autonomy is also respected. The author might not be in the wrong if her actions were motivated by seeking support and she made the decision to keep the child with her boyfriend later. The conflict here is more about differing expectations rather than a clear right or wrong. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, as she made a choice based on her needs and communicated the decision to her boyfriend eventually. However, the boyfriend's feelings are valid too, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. It's a matter of perspective and communication styles.\n"
