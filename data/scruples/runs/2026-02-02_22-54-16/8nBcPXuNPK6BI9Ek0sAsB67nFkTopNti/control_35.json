After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister first. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with family. Then she decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was annoyed because she went to her family first and made decisions without him. He felt it should be a mutual decision since it's their child.\n\nThe key points here are communication and shared decision-making. The boyfriend's argument is that it's their child, so the decision should be made together. The author, on the other hand, felt it was her choice, especially since her family has experience as mothers.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's part of the relationship and the future child's parent. It's important for couples to make major life decisions together. However, the author might have felt overwhelmed or uncertain and turned to her family for support first. It's understandable to seek advice from those who have been through similar situations.\n\nThe question is whether her actions were wrong. While it's good she informed her family, the boyfriend's feelings are hurt because he wasn't included in the initial decision-making process. The delay in telling him might have caused unnecessary anxiety or made him feel excluded. The author's reasoning that it's her choice might be true, but relationships often require teamwork, especially regarding shared responsibilities like a child.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the relationship dynamics. If the couple usually makes joint decisions, then the author might have erred by not involving him first. However, if she felt she needed family input first, that's a common approach. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out, which is a valid emotional response. The right answer here would be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but she could have handled it better by including her boyfriend earlier in the process. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Given that the situation is complex and both sides have valid points, but the boyfriend's reaction is based on valid concerns, the answer might lean towards B, but I need to check if there's a clear wrong here. Since the author had her reasons and the decision isn't solely hers, but the boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the initial action of telling family first isn't necessarily wrong, so the answer is B (No).\n"
