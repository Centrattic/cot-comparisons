After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend and decided to keep it without involving him in the initial decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a woman who just found out she's pregnant. She called her mom and sister first, then waited a few days to discuss with her family before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child. The author argues that it's her choice and that her family, being mothers themselves, could offer support.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The boyfriend's reaction is based on the idea that since it's a shared child, both parents should be involved in major decisions. The author might have felt more comfortable discussing it with her family first, especially if she was unsure about the decision. However, involving the partner in the decision-making process is important for mutual trust and respect. The author made the decision without the boyfriend's input, which could lead to feelings of exclusion or resentment. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that it's her choice and her family's advice was helpful. Maybe she needed emotional support first. The boyfriend's annoyance stems from being left out, which is valid. The question is whether the author was wrong to prioritize her family's input over her partner's involvement. \n\nIn many relationships, big decisions like this are made jointly. However, the author had a specific reason for involving her family first. The key point is that the decision was made without the boyfriend, even if it was after some family discussion. While the author's actions were understandable from her perspective, the boyfriend's feelings of being excluded are also reasonable. \n\nThe answer depends on cultural and personal relationship norms. In some contexts, the woman might handle initial decisions, but in others, the partner expects immediate involvement. The author might not be in the wrong, but she could have communicated better with her boyfriend early on to address his concerns. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's approach might be seen as self-protective. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's need for family support and the boyfriend's right to be involved. The decision to keep the baby is made, and the boyfriend is informed. The author's actions might be justified, but there's a lesson in partnership. The answer is likely B (No), as the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for discussion on communication.\n"
