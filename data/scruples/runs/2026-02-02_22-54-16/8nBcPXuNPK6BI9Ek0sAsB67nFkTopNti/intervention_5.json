After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She was unsure how her boyfriend would react, so she spent a few days discussing it with her family. She decided to keep the baby, then told her boyfriend. He was okay with it but annoyed that she told her family first and made the decision without him. The author feels she wasn't wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. In a relationship, communication is key. The boyfriend was upset because he felt left out of the decision-making process. The author's reasoning is that it's her body and her choice, and her family could provide support. \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend has a valid point. Major life decisions like this typically should be made together, especially since the child will affect both partners. Telling family first without involving the partner might have made him feel excluded or not trusted. However, the author's actions might be seen as seeking support from her family, which is natural, especially if she was uncertain about how her boyfriend would react.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? It depends on cultural norms, the couple's communication style, and their previous agreements. If they had a history of making big decisions together, then the author might have been wrong to bypass that. However, if they hadn't discussed such a scenario before, it's more about differing expectations. The author's intent was to seek support and figure things out, but she could have included her boyfriend earlier once she had more clarity. \n\nI think the key here is that while the author's actions were understandable, the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a shared decision. The author might not be entirely wrong, but there's a case for both sides. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the decision is fundamentally hers (as it's her body and her choice to keep the baby), but the partner's feelings are valid, it's a bit of a grey area. But given that the author had her reasons and the boyfriend's reaction was more about the process than the outcome, I lean towards her not being in the wrong. So the answer is B."
