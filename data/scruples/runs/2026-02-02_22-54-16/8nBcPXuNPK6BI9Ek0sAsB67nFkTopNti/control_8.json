After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about telling her mother and sister first before her boyfriend. She found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister, then after a few days, told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that it's her choice and that she talked to her family, who are mothers themselves. The boyfriend's point is that it's their child, so they should have made the decision together. The question is whether her actions were wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. If they hadn't discussed how to handle such a situation beforehand, maybe there's room for both to be wrong. However, the author might not have thought her boyfriend would be upset about the timing. She might have felt more comfortable discussing it with her family first, especially since they are experienced mothers. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is valid because he feels left out of the decision-making process for a shared responsibility.\n\nThe author did make a big decision without her partner, which can be hurtful. Even if she had good intentions, not involving her partner in the decision about their child's future could be seen as a mistake. But it's also understandable that she wanted her own support system. The key here is whether the author's actions were intentionally keeping him out. If she thought she was acting in her best interest and didn't consider his feelings, maybe she shares some responsibility. However, if she had no malicious intent and just wanted guidance, it's a communication issue rather than being in the wrong.\n\nIn some relationships, major decisions like this are made together, so the boyfriend's reaction is valid. But the author's actions might not be entirely wrong because she's also a person with her own support network. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the decision affects both partners, not including him might be a mistake. So, leaning towards A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't include him in the decision, even if her intention was to seek support from family. The boyfriend's point about shared responsibility is stronger here.\n"
