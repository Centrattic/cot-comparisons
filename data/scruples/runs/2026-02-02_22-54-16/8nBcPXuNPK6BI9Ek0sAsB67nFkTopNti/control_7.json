After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister, took a few days to think, then told her boyfriend. He's upset because he thought they should have decided together.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that she needed time to process and discuss with her family, who are both mothers, which might have given her support. She feels her choice is valid. The boyfriend feels left out, thinking it's their child and they should have made the decision together.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, communication in relationships is crucial. The boyfriend might feel that a major life decision like this should be mutual. On the other hand, the author might feel she had a right to seek support from her family first, especially since they have experience as mothers.\n\nBut the key point is that the boyfriend was not informed immediately. The author waited a few days and discussed with her family first. While it's understandable to seek family support, the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a joint decision. The question is whether informing the boyfriend first was necessary.\n\nIn many relationships, major decisions involving both partners are discussed together. Even if the author needed time to process, perhaps informing her boyfriend early enough to be part of the decision-making process would have been better. However, the author might have felt uncertain and needed to talk to her family first for support and guidance.\n\nBut considering it's a shared life decision, especially regarding a child, the boyfriend's perspective is valid. The author might have been in the wrong for not involving her boyfriend from the start, even if she sought family advice. However, the situation is complex, and different people might have different views on what's appropriate.\n\nLooking at similar scenarios, usually, if a partner is left out of a major decision, it can be seen as a misstep. The author's action could be seen as prioritizing her family's input over her partner's, which might be why the boyfriend is upset. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong). But also, the author might have had good reasons, so maybe B (not in the wrong). \n\nThe question is whether she was wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but does that mean she is in the wrong? It depends on the relationship norms they've established. If they hadn't discussed how to handle such situations, it's a grey area. However, in many cases, the shared responsibility of a child would imply mutual decision-making. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving her boyfriend from the beginning.\n"
