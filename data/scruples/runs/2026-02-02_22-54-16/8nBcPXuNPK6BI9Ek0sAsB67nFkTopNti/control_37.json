After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, called her mom and sister, then took a few days to think it over, discussed it with her family, decided to keep the baby, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child, but the author thinks it's her choice.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the order in which she shared the news and the decision-making process. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making, which is understandable because it's a big life event that affects both of them. On the other hand, the author might have felt the need to confide in her family first, especially since they are mothers themselves and could provide support.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, relationship dynamics, and personal boundaries. In many relationships, major decisions about pregnancy are indeed made jointly. However, the author might have felt overwhelmed or unsure and sought support from her family first. The boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be included in the decision-making process, which is valid. But does that make the author wrong? Or is it a matter of differing expectations in the relationship?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's her choice, which is true in terms of her body and her medical decisions. However, the emotional aspect of the relationship is also important. The boyfriend's annoyance stems from feeling excluded, which could lead to tension if not addressed. Maybe the right answer isn't a simple yes or no but depends on communication and mutual understanding.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we strictly look at the facts, she made a decision that affects both of them but went to her family first. However, the decision to keep the baby was made after consulting her family, and she did inform her boyfriend eventually. The boyfriend's reaction is about wanting joint decision-making, but the author sees it as her choice. Different perspectives here.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might view informing one's own family first as acceptable, especially for seeking advice. Others might prioritize the partner's right to be involved from the start. The answer might hinge on whether the decision was made in secrecy or with the intent to inform the partner later. Since she did tell her boyfriend eventually and he was \"pretty great about it,\" maybe the issue is more about the order and process rather than the outcome.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a nuanced situation. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's a valid point from the boyfriend's perspective. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since she didn't hide the pregnancy from her boyfriend permanently and made the decision with family input, perhaps the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. The boyfriend's right to be involved in the decision is a factor, but the author's right to seek support from her family is also valid. So, the answer might be B (No), but with the understanding that there's room for discussion and understanding between the couple.\n"
