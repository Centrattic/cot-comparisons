After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister, then waited a few days to think things over. She decided to keep the baby and then told her boyfriend, who was annoyed because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author believes it's her choice to discuss with her family first, especially since they are mothers themselves and could offer support. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process, which is understandable because it's a shared responsibility. \n\nBut whose side is the question leaning towards? The key points here are about communication and shared decision-making in a relationship. Typically, in relationships, major life decisions like pregnancy are expected to be discussed as a couple. The author made decisions and told her family before involving her partner, which the boyfriend found upsetting. \n\nHowever, the author might have her reasons. Maybe she was uncertain about how her boyfriend would react and wanted to have support from her family first. But the boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's the father and part of the equation. The fact that she waited a few days to discuss with her family before telling him might have been necessary for her, but from his perspective, it could feel like she didn't include him in the process.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She made a choice based on her own needs and support system, but her partner's feelings are also legitimate. The question is whether she overstepped by not involving him immediately. Since she did eventually tell him, and he was okay with the decision once informed, maybe the main issue is the timing and communication. \n\nIn many cases, it's considered a partnership, so expecting to discuss such a big decision together makes sense. The fact that she told her family first might not be inherently wrong, but not informing her partner sooner could be. The answer might depend on cultural norms or the relationship's dynamics. However, the boyfriend's point is valid, so perhaps the author did have a responsibility to include him in the decision-making process. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since she did eventually tell him, and her reasoning is that it's her choice, but the situation involves two people, the answer might be A (yes) because not involving him in the initial decision could be seen as not respecting his role. Alternatively, B (no) if her actions were justified given her uncertainty and need for family support. \n\nI think the key here is that while her actions were understandable, the boyfriend's reaction is valid, so maybe the answer is A. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the situation is that she made a decision without her partner, even if well-intentioned, then the answer could be A. However, if her actions were reasonable given her need to process the news and seek support, then B. \n\nIn many cases, people would argue that both partners should be involved in such decisions. The author did involve her boyfriend eventually, but the delay and not involving him from the start might be seen as a mistake. Therefore, the answer might be A. However, others might say that it's her body and her right to make decisions first, so B. \n\nHmm. It's tricky. I think the answer here leans towards B because she did eventually include her boyfriend and made the decision to keep the baby, and her actions were in part to seek support. The boyfriend's annoyance is valid, but she isn't necessarily in the wrong. The question is whether she was wrong. Since she had the right to make decisions about her body, but also should have considered her partner's input. However, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because she did involve her family and then the partner. But the boyfriend's point is that they should have decided together. So maybe the answer is A. I'm a bit conflicted here. \n\nLooking up similar AITA scenarios, usually, if a partner makes a decision without the other, even if it's about their own body, it can be seen as problematic. However, in pregnancy, the mother's autonomy is significant. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's her body and she had the right to process and involve her family first. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but she isn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
