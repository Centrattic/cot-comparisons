After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then after a few days of discussion with her family, decided to keep the baby. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child.\n\nSo the main question here is whether telling her family first was wrong. The boyfriend is upset because he wasn't involved in the decision-making process. The author argues that she needed time to think and discuss with her family, especially since they are mothers themselves. She also acknowledges the boyfriend's point but still doesn't feel in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. When a couple faces a major decision like an unexpected pregnancy, both partners ideally should be involved. The boyfriend's reaction makes sense because he might feel excluded or not trusted. However, the author's actions might be seen as her taking time to process and seek advice from her own support system. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's her choice, and she's a woman, so she might feel that the decision ultimately rests with her. But in a relationship, major life decisions, especially those involving both partners, should be mutual. The boyfriend's point is valid in that the child is theirs, so both have a stake in the decision.\n\nHowever, it's also understandable that the author would want to discuss with her family first. Her family's experience as mothers could provide valuable insight. The delay in informing her boyfriend might not be malicious, just her way of seeking support before sharing the news with him.\n\nNow, considering cultural or personal norms might play a role here. In some contexts, women might be expected to consult their family first, especially in matters involving pregnancy. But in a committed relationship, the expectation might be that both partners are informed and involved in the decision.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were respectful of her partner's role. By deciding on her own and not involving him immediately, she might have disregarded his feelings and the joint nature of the decision. However, she did eventually tell him and they are moving forward together. The boyfriend's reaction is about the process rather than the outcome.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, this is a bit subjective. The author isn't in the wrong because she sought family support, but she could have considered her boyfriend's perspective more. The boyfriend is also not entirely wrong in feeling left out. It's a situation where both partners might need to communicate better and adjust their expectations moving forward.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the act of informing family first is seen as a breach of trust or just a natural step. Since the author didn't hide the pregnancy from the boyfriend permanently and he's now involved, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong), but with the caveat that future communication needs improvement. However, some might argue that the boyfriend has a valid point, making it a complex situation. But the initial act of informing family first isn't inherently wrong, especially when considering her need for support and advice.\n"
