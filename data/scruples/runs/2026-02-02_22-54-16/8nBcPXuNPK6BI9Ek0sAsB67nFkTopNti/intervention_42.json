After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then after a few days, told her boyfriend. He was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author made the decision to inform her family first, possibly for support, especially since her mom and sister are mothers themselves. She then waited a few days to discuss with her family before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels it's their child and he should have been involved in the decision-making process from the start.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author has the right to seek support from her family, especially since pregnancy is a big life event and she might have been dealing with the news emotionally. Her family, being mothers themselves, could offer valuable advice or reassurance. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility. He might feel excluded or not trusted in the process. Since it's their child, he might believe he should have been part of the initial decision-making. The author waited a few days, which could make him feel like she didn't involve him in a timely manner. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Legally and ethically, the decision to share personal information with family is a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to share such news with her partner first. However, in a relationship, communication and mutual decision-making are important. Even though the author made the choice to involve her family first, it's possible that the way she communicated with her boyfriend could have been improved. She did tell him eventually, and he was supportive once informed. The issue seems more about the process rather than the decision itself.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's her choice because it's her body and the pregnancy is hers. But the child is theirs, so the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. However, the author's actions don't seem malicious. She was seeking support and processing the news with her family, which is a common and understandable response. \n\nIn many relationships, partners might expect to be involved in such decisions, but the author's approach isn't necessarily wrong. She did involve her partner eventually, and the key was that she took time to think with her family, which is a support system. The boyfriend's annoyance is about the order and timing rather than the decision to tell family. It's more about how they can improve communication moving forward rather than an outright wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The situation could benefit from better communication strategies, but her actions don't constitute a fault. The answer should be B.\n"
