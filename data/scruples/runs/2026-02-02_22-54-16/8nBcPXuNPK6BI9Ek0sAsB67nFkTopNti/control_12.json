After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with her family. Then she decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was upset because she told her family first and waited a few days. He felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she needed time to process and that her family, being mothers themselves, could offer support. The boyfriend feels left out, which is understandable because it's a shared life decision. \n\nNow, considering relationships dynamics, communication is key. The boyfriend might feel that major life decisions should be mutual, especially regarding a child. However, the author had her reasons for involving her family first, maybe seeking emotional support or advice. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, both have valid points. The boyfriend's feelings about being excluded make sense, but the author's need to process with her family is also valid. It's a balance between personal autonomy and partnership. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's not clear-cut. The author might not be in the wrong for seeking family support, but she could have communicated her plans with her boyfriend earlier, even if just to set expectations. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded, which is a common issue in relationships when major decisions are made without the partner. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions violate mutual expectations in the relationship. Since the author didn't consult her boyfriend first, but had her reasons, it's a nuanced situation. However, the boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility, which is important. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to improve communication. \n\nLooking at similar cases, often the key is mutual respect and communication. If the boyfriend felt excluded, the author could have explained her reasoning earlier. But her actions don't inherently make her wrong. It's more about how they navigate this together moving forward.\n"
