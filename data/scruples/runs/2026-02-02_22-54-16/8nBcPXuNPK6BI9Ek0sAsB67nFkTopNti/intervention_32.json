After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, waited a few days to think things over with her family, then told her boyfriend. He was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author shares the news with her family first. She mentions that her family are both mothers, so they might have given her advice or support. The boyfriend was upset because he wanted to be involved in the decision-making process from the start. He felt left out of the decision about whether to keep the baby, which is a major life choice affecting both of them.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that consulting her family was necessary because they have experience as mothers, and it's her body going through the pregnancy. On the other hand, the boyfriend's perspective is valid too. A pregnancy is a joint responsibility, so including him from the beginning could help in making a mutual decision. The author did tell him eventually, and he was okay with the decision, but the timing and process were the issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants to know my take. In relationships, communication is key. While it's understandable to seek support from family, significant decisions that affect both partners should ideally be discussed together. The author made the decision to keep the baby without consulting her partner first, which might have caused feelings of exclusion. However, the author also had the right to seek advice from her family, especially since they have experience.\n\nThere's a balance here. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but relationship norms vary. Some might say that the partner should be involved in such decisions from the start. Others might see the author's actions as seeking support and making a personal choice. The key point is that while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong,\" there's room for better communication moving forward. The boyfriend's reaction highlights the importance of mutual decision-making in shared responsibilities. So, the answer would depend on whether the decision to involve family first was a breach of trust or a necessary step. Since the author did eventually include the boyfriend and he agreed, maybe it's a case of poor communication rather than being outright wrong. But the boyfriend's feelings are valid, so the author should consider that for future decisions. So, the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong, but there are lessons to learn here.\n"
