After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant, took a couple of days to process, discussed it with her family, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have made the decision together. The author thinks she's not wrong because she involved her family first, especially since they are mothers.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend's point is valid because a pregnancy is a shared responsibility, and involving him early makes sense. However, the author's reasoning is that her family, who are mothers, could provide support and help her make a decision. She didn't keep it a secret; she just took time to think and involved her family first.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did eventually tell her boyfriend, and he was supportive. The issue is more about the order and the decision-making process rather than the content. The author might not be in the wrong because she had a valid reason to involve her family first, but there's a lesson here about including her partner in the process from the start. However, the fact that she did involve her boyfriend and he was okay with the decision might mitigate the issue. \n\nSo, considering the context, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here. The author might not be wrong because her actions were driven by seeking support from her family, but ideally, both partners should be involved in such decisions. However, since the author did eventually include her boyfriend and he's okay with the outcome, maybe she's not in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
