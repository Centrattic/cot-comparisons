After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, called her mom and sister right after the positive tests, then took a few days to think things over with her family before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child. The author thinks she's not wrong because talking to her family was important and they can relate as mothers.\n\nSo, the key points are: communication timing, the boyfriend's reaction, and the author's justification for involving her family first. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend felt left out, which is valid because it's their shared situation. The author had her reasons, like consulting her family who are mothers, which makes sense too. But the boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be part of the decision-making process. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the question is subjective. Some might say she should have included her partner first, especially since it's their child. Others might agree that consulting her own family for support is reasonable. The author doesn't feel wrong, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about feeling excluded rather than anger. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author had her own reasons and the boyfriend's reaction is more about wanting involvement rather than a clear mistake on her part. It's a gray area, but the question is whether she's \"in the wrong,\" and the narrative shows she had valid reasoning.\n"
