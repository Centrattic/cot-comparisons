      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister right away, then waited a few days to think things over with her family. She decided to keep the baby and then told her boyfriend. He was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child. She thinks she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that it's her body and her choice, and discussing with her family was natural since they are mothers. The boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility since it's their child. There's a common theme in relationships about making major decisions together, especially regarding children. However, the author might feel that consulting her family first was necessary for support.\n\nBut from the boyfriend's perspective, not involving him in the initial decision-making could be seen as not respecting his role as a partner. The key point here is whether the decision to involve her family before her partner was a breach of trust or shared responsibility. The author did eventually discuss it with her boyfriend, but the timing and the fact that she waited to decide without him might have caused the conflict.\n\nIn many relationships, it's expected that both partners discuss such life-changing decisions together. However, the author might argue that the decision was hers to make, especially regarding her own body. But the boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt excluded, which is valid if he's part of the parent equation. The situation might not be a clear-cut right or wrong. The author's actions were based on her need for family support, but the boyfriend felt left out. It's possible that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for her to consider his feelings more in the future. However, given that she consulted her family who are experienced mothers, maybe her reasoning is sound. The answer might hinge on cultural norms and relationship expectations. Without more context on their communication habits, it's a bit subjective. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), as she's not necessarily wrong, but there's a valid point on the boyfriend's side. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because she didn't include him first. Hmm. Need to decide based on general relationship norms. Typically, major decisions like whether to have a child are made together, so maybe the author did wrong by not discussing with him first. However, she did eventually tell him and they decided together. Wait, she says she told her family first, then discussed with them over a few days, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend wanted to decide together, but she already made the decision. So the key issue is whether she should have involved him in the initial decision-making. If the relationship expects mutual decision-making, then she might be in the wrong. If the relationship allows her to seek family advice first, then she's not. Since the question is general, without specific context, the answer might be B (No) because she's not wrong, but she could have done better. However, another angle is that she made a key life decision without her partner, which is a problem. So maybe A (Yes). But I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong, but she should consider her partner's feelings next time. The answer is B.\n"
