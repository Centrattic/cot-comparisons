After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think it over, discussing with her family. Then decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was okay but annoyed that she told her family first and made decisions without him. He thought they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's her choice, and her family are mothers themselves, so they could discuss it. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and shared decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process. But the author believes it's her right to make decisions, especially since the family are mothers and can provide support.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to discuss major life events, especially when they affect both partners. The baby is a joint responsibility, so involving the partner in decisions makes sense. However, the author might feel that discussing with her family first was necessary for her own processing and decision-making. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a bit subjective. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he wanted to be involved. But the author's actions might be justified if she felt she needed her family's input first. The fact that she eventually told her boyfriend and he was okay with the decision might mitigate some of the issue. However, the boyfriend's feelings of being excluded are real. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication. \n\nThe answer depends on the relationship dynamics. If the couple usually makes decisions together, then the author might have made a mistake by not involving him first. But if the author felt she needed time to process and her family's input was crucial, it's understandable. The key is whether there was mutual understanding. Since the author didn't consult her partner first, even if her reasons are valid, the boyfriend's perspective is valid too. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the decision should have been a joint one. Since it's their child, joint decisions are expected. However, the author's actions were to discuss with her family first, which might be seen as prioritizing her own support system. \n\nIn conclusion, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's a gray area. The boyfriend's feelings are important, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but the situation could have been handled better by including the boyfriend earlier.\n"
