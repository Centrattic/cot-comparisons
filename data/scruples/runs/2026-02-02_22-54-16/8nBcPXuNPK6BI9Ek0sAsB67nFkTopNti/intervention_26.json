After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for telling her family before her boyfriend. The situation is she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he felt they should have made the decision together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was dealing with a significant life event\u2014pregnancy. She mentioned she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took time to think with her family. Both her mom and sister are mothers, so they might have provided emotional support and advice. That makes sense; family can be a support system.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is that he felt left out, which is valid. He might see the pregnancy as a shared responsibility, so being included in the decision-making process could be important to him. The author's reasoning is that it's her choice, especially since it's her body. But pregnancy does affect both partners, so communication is key here.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she did involve her family, which is natural, especially when dealing with uncertainty. However, not informing her partner immediately could have caused hurt feelings. Maybe the timing or the method of disclosure was an issue. The author had a reason to wait\u2014she wasn't sure how he'd react. But the boyfriend felt it was a joint decision. The key here is whether the author's actions were selfish or considerate.\n\nOn one hand, seeking support from family is understandable. On the other, not involving her partner in the initial decision might have been a misstep. However, the author's main point is that it's her choice, and she doesn't feel wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more about feeling excluded rather than the decision itself. \n\nI think the answer depends on the relationship's expectations. If they had prior communication about such situations, maybe she should have followed that. But since she didn't, her actions might not be entirely wrong. So, probably answer B (No), but there's nuance here. The author isn't wrong, but she could have handled it differently to consider her partner's feelings more.\n"
