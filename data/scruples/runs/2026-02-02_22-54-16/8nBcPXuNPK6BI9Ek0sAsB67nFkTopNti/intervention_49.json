After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend later. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together, but she thinks it's her choice since it's her body and she discussed it with her family who are also mothers.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is about communication and decision-making in a relationship. The author made a decision to inform her family first, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels it's a joint decision. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that she had the right to consult her family, especially since they are mothers and could offer support. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel left out of the decision-making process, which is understandable because they are in a relationship and expecting a child together. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, it's her body, and she has the autonomy to make decisions about her health and pregnancy. However, relationships require communication and mutual respect. By not including her boyfriend in the initial decision, she might have overlooked his perspective. That said, she did eventually tell him and they ended up deciding to keep the baby together. \n\nThe key point here is whether informing her family first without her boyfriend was a mistake. Some might argue that in a committed relationship, major life decisions like this should be discussed with the partner first. Others might say that seeking support from family is natural and not wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on the relationship's norms. If the boyfriend expected to be involved in all major decisions from the start, then the author's action might not meet his expectations. However, she didn't hide the news permanently; she just informed her family first. She also considered his feelings after telling him. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? I think it's a nuanced situation. Legally and ethically, she's not in the wrong because it's her body. But relationally, there's room for discussion. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for seeking family support. The answer would likely be B (No), but it's a close call.\n"
