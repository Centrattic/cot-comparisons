After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling their mom and sister about the pregnancy before their boyfriend.\n\nSo, the situation is: the author found out they're pregnant. They told their mom first, then sister, took a few days to think, and then told their boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he expected them to decide together. The author thinks it's their choice and isn't in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The key points here are about decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend wants to be involved in decisions that affect both of them, especially something as big as a pregnancy. The author, on the other hand, felt it was their choice and consulted their own family, who are mothers, for advice. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the boyfriend's side, he might feel that a decision like this should be made jointly, especially since it's their child. He might feel left out or not trusted. On the other hand, the author might feel that discussing it with their own family first was natural, especially since they were unsure how the boyfriend would react and wanted to process things with their own support system.\n\nBut is there a right or wrong here? Relationships often require communication and mutual understanding. The author didn't hide the pregnancy but told their family first. However, the boyfriend's reaction is about being part of the decision-making process. The author did eventually tell the boyfriend, but the timing and the fact that they made a decision without him could be the issue.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. It's possible that the author acted out of seeking support, which is understandable, but the boyfriend's feeling of being excluded is valid too. The answer might depend on the relationship's norms and expectations. If the couple had prior agreements about such decisions, that would matter. If not, it's a common conflict where both parties have valid points.\n\nIn many relationships, major life decisions are made together. The pregnancy decision affects both partners, so involving each other from the start is important. While the author had a right to seek support, the decision to keep the child might ideally be made with the partner. The author made a decision before involving the boyfriend, which could be seen as not respecting his role in the partnership. However, the author's actions were also about seeking advice from their own family, which is a common practice.\n\nSo, maybe the answer isn't a clear A or B. But according to the options, we have to choose. If the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering that the boyfriend's feelings are valid and that joint decisions are important, maybe the author is partially at fault. However, the post says the author can see the boyfriend's point but doesn't feel wrong. \n\nThe final decision hinges on whether the author overstepped by making a decision without the partner. Since the author made a choice (to keep the baby) before discussing with the boyfriend, even if they told him afterward, the timing and process might be the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the decision affects both and should ideally be made together. Alternatively, if the author had discussed with family but was still open to the boyfriend's input, maybe not. But the key is that the author had already decided to keep the baby before telling the boyfriend. So, yes, the author is in the wrong because they didn't involve their partner in the decision-making process.\n"
