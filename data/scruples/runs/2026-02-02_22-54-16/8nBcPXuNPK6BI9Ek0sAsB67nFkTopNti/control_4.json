After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister, took a few days to think things over, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key point is the order in which she shared the news. She told her family first, then her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels it's their child and they should have discussed it together. The author thinks she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves, which probably gave her support.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he might feel excluded or not trusted. Pregnancy is a big life decision, and he might want to be part of the process. However, the author had her reasons: she wasn't sure how he'd react, so she discussed it with her family first. She ended up deciding to keep the child and then told him. He was okay with the decision but upset about the process.\n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong. It's a judgment call. Some might say that in a committed relationship, both partners should be involved in such decisions. Others might argue that she had her reasons and it's her body, so she isn't wrong. The key factors are communication and mutual respect. Did she act out of consideration? She did tell him eventually and was open to discussing when to tell families. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions were based on her uncertainty and seeking support. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often looks at intentions and whether there was malicious intent. Here, the author didn't hide the pregnancy; she just sought support first. The boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be included, which is reasonable. But the author's actions might not be seen as wrong because she had her reasons and communicated the decision once made. The answer might lean towards B (No), but there's a middle ground where both perspectives have validity. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, not if both are partially at fault. Since she made a choice based on her needs and communicated eventually, maybe the answer is B.\n"
