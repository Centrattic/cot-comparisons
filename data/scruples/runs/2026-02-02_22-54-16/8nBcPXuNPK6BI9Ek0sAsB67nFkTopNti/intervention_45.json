After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her family first, then told her boyfriend. He was upset because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are: the author made a significant life decision (keeping the pregnancy) and discussed it with her family before informing her partner. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process since it's their child. The author, on the other hand, feels it's her choice and that her family, being mothers themselves, could offer support.\n\nI should think about the balance between personal autonomy and partnership. The author might have felt the need to process the news with her close family first, especially since they have experience as mothers. Her decision to keep the pregnancy is a major step, and discussing it with her family could have helped her reach that conclusion. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also valid because a pregnancy affects both partners, and he might feel excluded from the decision that impacts both of them.\n\nBut does that make her wrong? It's a judgment call. In relationships, communication is key. While the author acted from her need for support, maybe she could have included her boyfriend earlier in the discussion, even if she was still processing. However, she did eventually tell him and they decided together to keep the child. The boyfriend's annoyance comes from feeling left out of the decision-making timeline rather than the decision itself. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because her actions were about seeking support from her family, which is a common practice. But there's room for understanding the boyfriend's perspective. The question is whether she was wrong. Given that the decision was made to keep the child, and she shared the news with her family first, it's a situation where both parties have valid points. However, the core issue is whether her actions were wrong. Since she didn't hide the decision from him permanently and did involve him eventually, the answer is more likely B (not in the wrong). The key is that she shared the information once she was ready, and her family's input was a part of her process. The boyfriend's feelings are important, but that doesn't mean she was wrong.\n"
