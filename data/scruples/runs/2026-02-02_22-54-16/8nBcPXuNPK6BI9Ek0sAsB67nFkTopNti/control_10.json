After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her family before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister before her boyfriend. She waited a few days to decide to keep the baby, then told her boyfriend. He's upset because he feels it should have been a joint decision. She says she consulted her family, who are mothers, and it's her choice.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether she was wrong. The options are A or B. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the boyfriend might feel left out of a major life decision. He's part of the relationship, so sharing such news first makes sense. On the other hand, she might feel she needed to discuss it with her family first, especially since they're mothers and could offer support. \n\nIs there a cultural or social norm here? Typically, people might share news with their partner first, but sometimes people might feel the need to talk to close family first, especially in a big decision like this. It's not clear if there's a right or wrong here. The key is whether her actions were disrespectful or harmful. \n\nShe did eventually tell her boyfriend and they discussed it, but he was annoyed. She acknowledges his point but doesn't feel wrong. The main issue is communication. Maybe she should have told him earlier, but given the context of consulting family, it's not necessarily her fault. The answer might hinge on whether the decision required both of them. Since it's a joint responsibility, maybe she should have included him. However, the decision to keep the baby was hers to make, as it's her body. So there's a balance between his feelings and her autonomy.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she had her reasons and communicated eventually, even if there's room for better communication. The key is that she didn't act maliciously but felt the need family support first.\n"
