After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out early, took a couple of days to process, discussed it with her family, and then told her boyfriend. He was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that it's her body and her choice, and she turned to her family for support since they are mothers. She did eventually tell her boyfriend, and he was okay with the pregnancy but upset about the order of disclosure. The boyfriend feels it's their child and wanted to be involved in the decision-making process from the start.\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to make decisions about her own body and seek support from her family. Especially since they are mothers, they might offer relevant advice. It's common for people to turn to family first in such personal matters. There's no law or strict social rule that says you must tell your partner first.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's perspective is valid too. When a couple is in a relationship, especially one where they're considering having a child together, communication is key. He might feel excluded or that his input wasn't considered. However, the author did share the decision with him eventually, and he was supportive of the outcome. The main issue is the delay in involving him in the decision-making.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? The key points here are autonomy and communication. The author made a personal choice and involved her family, which is her right. The boyfriend's reaction is more about the process than the decision itself. Since the author did inform her partner eventually and he's okay with the pregnancy, maybe the main issue is his reaction rather than her actions. However, if the couple had prior agreements about such matters, that might affect the situation. But based on the information given, there's no indication of prior agreements, so the author isn't necessarily wrong in seeking her family's support first. It's a personal choice and a matter of communication style rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
