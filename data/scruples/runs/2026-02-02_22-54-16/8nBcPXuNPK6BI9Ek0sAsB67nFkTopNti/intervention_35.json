After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The author found out she's pregnant, told her family first, then decided to keep the baby. Her boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's decision-making process, communication with her partner, and the boyfriend's reaction. \n\nFirst, the author called her mom and sister after confirming the pregnancy. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she discussed it with her family and made a decision. Then she told her boyfriend. He was okay with the pregnancy but upset about not being included in the initial decision.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's important to communicate major life changes with your partner. The boyfriend felt left out, which is valid because it's a shared life decision. However, the author's reasoning is that it's her body and her choice to make, and she sought advice from her family, who are mothers themselves. \n\nBut pregnancy and raising a child is a joint responsibility. The boyfriend might feel that his input is crucial, especially since he's the father. The author did make a decision without involving him first, which could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid reason for involving her family first\u2014seeking support and advice, especially from people who understand motherhood. However, she didn't consider that her boyfriend should be a key part of that decision-making process from the start. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. She had the right to make the decision, but not involving her partner could have been hurtful. It might depend on the dynamics of their relationship. If they had a history of making big decisions together, then her actions might be seen as dismissive. If they had different communication styles, maybe it's less so. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is understandable. He might feel that as a parent, his opinion matters. The author could have been more inclusive by discussing it with him earlier, even if she was still considering. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were to seek support from her family, not involving her partner immediately could be seen as a mistake. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, given the user's initial thought that the author isn't in the wrong, I need to check if that's the case. The user might think that since it's her body and she had family support, it's okay. But in a relationship, big decisions should be mutual. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
