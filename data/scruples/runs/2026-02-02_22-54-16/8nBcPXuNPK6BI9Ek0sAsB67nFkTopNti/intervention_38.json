After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with family. Later, she told the boyfriend, who was okay with the pregnancy but annoyed that she told her family first and made decisions without him. He wanted them to decide together since it's their child. The author feels her family, being mothers themselves, could give good advice, and she doesn't feel wrong for involving them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't, but wants another opinion.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. From the boyfriend's side, he might feel that major life decisions should be shared equally, especially since it's their child. It's reasonable for him to feel left out. On the other hand, the author probably felt the need to confide in her family, especially since they have experience as mothers. It's also her body and her immediate emotional support system.\n\nCultural norms might play a role here. In some cultures, consulting family first is common. But in relationships, mutual decision-making is important. The key point is communication. The author didn't hide the pregnancy from the boyfriend; she just informed her family first. However, the boyfriend might have expected to be informed immediately, especially since he's the other parent. The delay and decision-making without him could be a point of contention.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it was her choice and she needed support from her family. While that's valid, relationships often require partnership in decisions that affect both parties. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a major decision. The author's actions might not be \"wrong\" in a moral sense, but it's a communication issue that could lead to resentment.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If she had discussed it with her boyfriend as well, that would be ideal. But she did share the decision with her family first, which is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction is also valid because he's part of the partnership. Perhaps the answer depends on how the situation is handled moving forward, but based on the information, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for discussion. The answer should be B (No), but with considerations about relationship dynamics.\n"
