After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first before telling her boyfriend. She took a few days to think things over with her family, decided to keep the baby, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together. The author thinks she's not in the wrong because it's her choice, and her family are mothers who could offer support.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about communication in a relationship and who makes decisions about pregnancy. The boyfriend's grievance is about not being included in the decision-making process, which is a valid concern. However, the author's reasoning is that she was uncertain and sought support from her family first, especially since they are women who can provide advice. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. In a committed relationship, major life decisions like having a child usually require mutual agreement. The author made a significant choice without involving her partner, which could lead to feelings of exclusion. On the other hand, she might have felt overwhelmed and needed time and support from her family, which is understandable.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is about the process. Even if the decision is hers to make (like in cases of differing opinions), the lack of communication could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. However, the author did explain her reasoning and the boyfriend's response was annoyance rather than anger. The question is whether her actions were wrong.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while women have autonomy over their bodies, involving a partner in such a major decision is usually expected. The author's choice to consult her family first might be seen as seeking support, but it could also be perceived as bypassing her partner. The answer might depend on the relationship dynamics. If the couple is a team, then including the partner is important. But if the author felt she needed time to process, maybe she wasn't in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the author had a reason to consult her family and the decision to keep the baby is her choice. However, the boyfriend's feelings are valid, so maybe there's room for both sides. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author didn't act maliciously and had her reasons, she's probably not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
