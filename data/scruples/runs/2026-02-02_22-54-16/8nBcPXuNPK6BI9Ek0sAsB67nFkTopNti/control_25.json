After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nSo the situation is: She found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think things over, discussing with her family. She decided to keep the baby, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have discussed it together, as it's their child. She thinks she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication in a relationship. The woman went to her family first, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend felt left out of the decision-making process. The question is whether she was wrong for doing so.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to expect discussing major life decisions together. Pregnancy is a significant event affecting both partners. By not informing her boyfriend immediately and instead consulting her family first, she might have overlooked his need to be part of the process. However, her reasoning is that she needed to process her own feelings and consult her family, who are also mothers, for support.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is valid because he feels excluded. The decision to have a child impacts both of them, and ideally, such decisions are made jointly. The woman might have acted in her own emotional processing, but it's important in a partnership to communicate major news to each other promptly and involve each other in the decision-making.\n\nOn the other hand, she did eventually share the decision with her boyfriend and he was okay with it. The delay wasn't about hiding the pregnancy but about processing the news with her family first. There's a balance between personal autonomy and partnership. She might not be in the wrong because she had her reasons, but she could have included her partner earlier in the discussion to avoid his feeling sidelined.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be B (No), as she isn't in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication. However, some might argue A (Yes) because the decision affects both. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since she shared the decision eventually and her actions were about her own processing, maybe B is the right answer. But it's close. The boyfriend's valid feelings don't make her wrong, but they do highlight a communication issue. The answer might hinge on whether the delay was necessary and if she considered his perspective.\n"
