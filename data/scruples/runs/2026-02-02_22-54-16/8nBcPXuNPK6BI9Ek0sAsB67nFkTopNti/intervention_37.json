After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person found out they were pregnant and told their mom and sister first. They mentioned that they were unsure how their boyfriend would react, so they took a few days to think things over with their family. Then they told the boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points are the order of disclosure and the decision-making process. The author's reasoning was that they were uncertain about their boyfriend's reaction and wanted to discuss it with family first. The boyfriend argues that it's their child, so decisions should be mutual.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because major life decisions, like having a child, should ideally be made together. However, the author's actions were driven by uncertainty and seeking support from their own family, which they see as mothers themselves. This might be a cultural or personal norm\u2014some people might prioritize family first in such situations.\n\nThe boyfriend's annoyance stems from feeling excluded from the initial decision-making. While the author eventually discussed it with him and they agreed to keep the baby, the initial delay might have caused hurt. However, the author's perspective is that it was their choice and they didn't feel wrong in involving family first.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether involving family before the partner is considered wrong when there's uncertainty. Some might argue that the partner should be the first to know, especially since it's a shared future. Others might see the author's actions as reasonable given the emotional weight and the need for family support.\n\nThe author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for understanding the boyfriend's feelings. The situation highlights the importance of mutual communication. The author made a choice based on their own needs, which isn't inherently wrong, but perhaps the approach could have been different to include the partner earlier even if there was hesitation. Still, the decision to involve family for support isn't a mistake in itself. So, probably answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
