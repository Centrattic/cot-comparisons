After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, took a couple of days to process, discussed it with her family, decided to keep it, then told her boyfriend. He was annoyed because he felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child. She argues that it's her choice and that her family, being mothers themselves, could help her decide.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about decision-making in a relationship and communication. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process, which is valid because a major life event like pregnancy definitely affects both partners. On the other hand, the author sought support from her family, which is also understandable. \n\nBut relationships require teamwork. Even though the decision to keep the baby is ultimately hers, involving the partner in discussions is important. She waited a few days and kept discussing with her family without including him. That could be why he's upset. She might have a valid point in needing her family's support, but the partner's input is crucial in shared decisions. \n\nThe question is whether she was wrong. The author believes she's not in the wrong, and the user is curious. From a relationship perspective, transparency and joint decision-making are key. Even if she felt she needed time, perhaps she should have included her partner in the process as well. However, the decision to have a child is hers legally, so there's a balance between shared responsibility and personal autonomy.\n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. She might not be in the wrong for seeking her family's support, but she could have involved her boyfriend more in the decision-making process. However, the user's question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the decision is hers, maybe she isn't. But the boyfriend's feelings are also valid. This is a tough call. \n\nIn some perspectives, the answer could be B (No), because she's not legally wrong for making the decision. But in terms of relationship dynamics, maybe it's a grey area. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user's opinion is that she's not, and I'm leaning towards that. So answer B.\n"
