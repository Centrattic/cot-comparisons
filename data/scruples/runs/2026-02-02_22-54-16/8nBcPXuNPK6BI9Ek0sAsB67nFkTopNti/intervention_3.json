After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The woman found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then took a few days to decide whether to keep the baby. She discussed it with her family during that time. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child. The woman thinks she's not in the wrong because she consulted her family, who are mothers themselves, and it's her choice.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend feels that major life decisions about their child should be made jointly, which is a valid perspective. On the other hand, the woman might feel that seeking support from her family is her right, especially since they have experience as mothers.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. While the woman did involve her family, who she trusts for advice, she didn't include her partner in the decision-making process initially. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a major decision that affects both of them. Even though the woman made the choice she felt was right, the lack of joint discussion before telling her family could be seen as a misstep in partnership. However, it's also true that she did involve her family for their input, which is a common practice for many women in similar situations.\n\nThe question is whether she was wrong. From a relationship ethics standpoint, both partners should ideally be involved in significant decisions affecting their shared future. However, the woman's actions might be justified if she felt she needed support and guidance, especially if the boyfriend wasn't immediately available or if there was a history of not discussing such matters together. The key here is the intention and the context. If she made the decision unilaterally without consulting her partner at all, that could be seen as wrong. But in this case, she did take time to think and discuss with family, which might be a middle ground.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong because she sought advice from trusted family members and made a decision that she felt was right, even though it's a shared decision. But there's also a valid argument that she should have included her partner in the process from the start. The boyfriend's reaction is about partnership, which is important. However, since the woman did eventually tell her boyfriend and they are working through it, maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong, but the situation highlights the need for better communication between them.\n"
