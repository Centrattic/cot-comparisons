After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that she told her mother and sister she was pregnant before telling her boyfriend. She then discussed it with her family and decided to keep the pregnancy, but when she told her boyfriend, he was upset because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the viewpoints. The author's reasoning: she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she talked to her family first. She mentions her boyfriend was \"pretty great\" about it once she told him, but he was annoyed because she didn't involve him in the decision-making. He argues it's their child and the decision should have been mutual. The author thinks it's her choice and doesn't see herself as wrong, especially since her family includes mothers who could offer advice.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and shared decision-making in a relationship. In relationships, major life decisions like having a child are typically expected to be mutual. However, the author had initial uncertainty about her boyfriend's reaction and turned to her family for support. Her boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from the process, which is understandable. On the other hand, she might have felt the need to consult her own family first, especially since they are mothers and could provide relevant advice.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The answer hinges on the norms of relationship dynamics. Generally, while it's okay to seek support from family, making a decision that affects both partners without their input can be seen as a misstep. However, the author did share the news with her boyfriend eventually and he was accepting. The delay in informing him might be the issue. But since the decision to keep the child was made after discussing with family and the boyfriend was informed later, maybe the main conflict is about the timing and inclusion in the decision process.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and consequences. The author's intent was to process the news and seek support before involving her boyfriend. The consequence is her boyfriend feeling left out. However, the author argues it was her choice, which is valid, but in a relationship, such a significant decision affecting both people might require collaboration. So, there's a balance here. The boyfriend's reaction is valid in expecting joint decision-making, but the author's actions were perhaps driven by her need to process and seek support.\n\nConsidering both sides, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she did involve her boyfriend eventually and he accepted it. However, she could have included him in the discussion earlier. The community might split on this, but since the question is binary (A or B), the answer would depend on whether the act of telling family first is inherently wrong. Since relationships require teamwork, the answer might lean towards A (yes, she's in the wrong), but others might say B (no). I need to recall common AITA responses. Often, if a person makes a decision that affects their partner without discussion, even if it's to seek support, it's seen as a mistake. So, the boyfriend's perspective is valid, but the author's actions were understandable. However, in the context of the relationship, the correct approach would have been to include the boyfriend in the process. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
