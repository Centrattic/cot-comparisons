After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, called her mom and sister, took a few days to think things over with her family, decided to keep the baby, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed that she told her family first and didn't involve him in the decision-making process. She acknowledges his point but feels she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about decision-making in a relationship and communication. The boyfriend feels that as a couple, they should have made the decision together, especially since the child is theirs. The author, on the other hand, thought discussing it with family was important, given their experience as mothers.\n\nIn relationships, shared decision-making is usually important, especially for major life events like having a child. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable because he feels left out of a decision that affects both of them. However, the author's actions might be seen as seeking support from her family, which is a common practice.\n\nBut here's the thing: while seeking family advice is normal, the key issue is whether the decision was made collaboratively. The author made the decision before involving the boyfriend, which might have made him feel excluded. Even though it's her body and the decision she's making, the relationship aspect can't be ignored. The boyfriend's point is valid because the child is theirs, and significant decisions should ideally be mutual.\n\nHowever, the author did eventually tell the boyfriend and he was okay with the decision. The fact that she didn't wait to involve him immediately might be the crux of the problem. The boyfriend's annoyance could stem from feeling that his input was necessary from the start. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. Culturally, people might have different views. Some might say she's not wrong because family support is crucial, others might argue that the partner should be included first. But in a relationship, transparency and communication are key. Even if the decision is hers, the process of making it without the partner could be seen as a misstep.\n\nSo, considering all that, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of both. She made a personal decision, which she had the right to do, but the way she approached it without including her boyfriend first might have caused unnecessary hurt or feelings of exclusion. The boyfriend's reaction is about partnership in the decision. Therefore, the answer might lean towards her being in the wrong because she didn't involve her partner in the initial decision-making process, even if she did seek family advice.\n"
