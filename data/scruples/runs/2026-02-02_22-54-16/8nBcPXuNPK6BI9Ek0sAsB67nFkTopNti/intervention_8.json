After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think things over with her family and decided to keep the baby. Then she told her boyfriend, who was annoyed because he felt they should have discussed it together first. The author thinks her family's input is important since they are mothers themselves.\n\nSo, the key points here are: sharing the news with family before the partner, decisions made without the partner, and the partner's reaction.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend's reaction makes sense because he feels it's their child, so decisions should be made jointly. However, the author had her reasons for involving her family first, especially since they are mothers and could offer support. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, it depends on the couple's dynamics and what they expect from each other. The author didn't do anything illegal, but she might have breached the boyfriend's expectations. The boyfriend's annoyance is about not being included in the initial decision-making process. \n\nBut the author didn't hide it; she told her family, made a decision, and then informed her boyfriend. The decision to keep the baby was hers, which is her right. However, involving the partner in the process is important for their relationship. \n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she made a personal decision and sought support from her family. But she might have missed the opportunity to involve her partner from the start, which the boyfriend felt was important. \n\nSince the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, I should consider that. The question is whether her actions were in the wrong. Given that she shared the news eventually and made the decision to keep the baby, but the boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. However, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed her own judgment and involved her family, which is a valid approach. The boyfriend's feelings are valid too, but that doesn't make her wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
