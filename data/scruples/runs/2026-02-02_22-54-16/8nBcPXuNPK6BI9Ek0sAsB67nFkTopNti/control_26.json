After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nThe key points from the scenario: The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then waited a few days to think things over with her family. She then decided to keep the baby and told her boyfriend, who was annoyed because he felt they should have discussed it together first as it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend felt left out and wanted to be part of the initial decision-making process. He might see this as a shared responsibility, especially since it's their child. On the other hand, the author might have felt that consulting her own family, who are mothers, was necessary for her emotional support and decision-making. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's action of informing her family first could be seen as a personal choice, especially since she's the one carrying the child and making the immediate decisions. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also valid because major life decisions involving both partners should ideally be discussed together. \n\nBut does that mean the author is in the wrong? It depends on the relationship's norms and mutual agreements. If there was an expectation that such decisions would be made jointly, then maybe she should have included him first. However, if there was no prior agreement, her approach isn't necessarily wrong. She did eventually inform her boyfriend and they discussed it, which is important. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author acted against the relationship's established communication norms. Since the question is whether she's \"in the wrong,\" it's subjective. But given the scenario, she might not be in the wrong if there was no prior agreement to consult each other first. However, she could have considered her boyfriend's perspective by including him earlier to avoid his feeling of being left out. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is more about feeling excluded rather than the act of informing the family first. The author didn't hide the pregnancy from him; she just shared it with her family first. The decision to keep the baby was made after consulting her family, and she informed her boyfriend after that. \n\nIn this context, while the boyfriend's feelings are valid, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if there was no prior agreement to consult him first. However, the situation highlights the importance of mutual communication in such decisions. Since the question asks if the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No), but there's room for discussion. However, the boyfriend's argument isn't invalid either. But based on the information given, without prior agreements, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
