After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, did two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think it over and discuss with her family. Then she told her boyfriend. He was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together, as it's their child. The author thinks she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nSo, the main points are: timing of disclosure, decision-making process, and differing perspectives between the author and her boyfriend.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend might feel excluded or not involved in the initial decision-making. The author might have felt the need to process with her own family first, especially since they are mothers and could offer support or advice. However, the boyfriend's reaction is about partnership\u2014feeling that major life decisions should be mutual.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it depends on the context of their relationship. If they had prior expectations about such decisions, but the author didn't share that. She thought discussing with her family was appropriate. But her boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's a parent too, and being left out could be hurtful. However, the author isn't necessarily wrong for seeking support from her family first. It's a common practice for people to share big news with close family before the partner, especially in moments of uncertainty.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple had a history of making decisions together, then the author might have a responsibility to include her boyfriend sooner. But given the information, the author didn't mention prior discussions about this. She took time to decide, which is her right. The key is whether the decision to inform her family first was a breach of trust or partnership. Since the boyfriend was informed eventually and their decision to keep the child was mutual after discussing, maybe the issue is more about the timing and process rather than the outcome.\n\nIn many cases, people's families are their immediate support system, especially in unexpected news. The author might have been processing her own feelings and seeking advice before sharing with her partner. The boyfriend's annoyance is valid, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for seeking family support first. It's a matter of differing expectations in the relationship.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
