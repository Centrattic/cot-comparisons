I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.

He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author found out she's pregnant, did two tests, then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how to proceed and took a few days to think it over, discussing with her family. She decided to keep the baby and then told her boyfriend. He was okay about the pregnancy but annoyed that she told her family first and made the decision without involving him. He said it should have been a joint decision because it's their child. The author thinks she's not in the wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the order of disclosure and the decision-making process. The boyfriend feels left out because he's a parent figure to the child as well, even if they're not married. The author's reasoning is that she had support from her family, who are women and mothers, which makes sense. But the boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility. \n\nIn relationships, communication is usually really important. The boyfriend might feel that since it's a shared responsibility, decisions should be made together. However, the author might have been seeking emotional support and guidance from her family first, which is a common practice. There's no mention of the boyfriend knowing about the pregnancy earlier, so maybe he felt blindsided. But the author did wait a few days to discuss with her family before bringing it up with him. \n\nI wonder if there's a cultural or personal norm here. Some people might expect the partner to be the first to know, but others might prioritize family, especially in a big decision like this. The author's decision to keep the baby was made after talking to her family, so maybe she felt more confident in her choice after that. However, the boyfriend's annoyance comes from the fact that he wasn't involved in the initial decision. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she was processing the news and seeking support. But the boyfriend's reaction is valid because it's their child and he might have wanted to be part of the decision-making. The main issue is the lack of communication with him before involving the family. If the author had discussed her plan to tell the family first with him, maybe the situation wouldn't have been a problem. But she didn't, which led to his annoyance. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the relationship was supposed to be a partnership, then involving him in the decision-making process is important. The fact that she told her family first might be seen as not valuing his input. But if the family were her main support system and she needed to talk to them first, that's understandable. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The author's actions were self-protective, seeking support from her family, which is natural. However, the boyfriend's feelings are valid because he's a co-parent. The right answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B), but there's room for improvement in communication. The question is whether her actions were wrong, not just whether the boyfriend is right to be upset. Since she had her own reasons and the decision wasn't finalized until she told her boyfriend, maybe she's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because the boyfriend's perspective is about shared responsibility. However, the author's reasoning about her family's experience as mothers could justify her actions. So I'll go with B, No, the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
