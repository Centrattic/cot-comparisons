After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before their boyfriend. The author explained that after getting a positive test, they told their mom and sister first, then took a few days to think and discuss with family before telling the boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together, but the author thinks it's their choice and they don't feel wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about the decision-making process in a relationship. The author made a big life decision\u2014whether to keep the baby\u2014and discussed it with family first. The boyfriend felt left out, which is valid because it's their child. However, the author's reasoning is that it's their body and choice. \n\nBut wait, in a relationship, major decisions that affect both partners should ideally be made together. The author did make the decision alone, even though they considered their family's input. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a joint decision. On the other hand, the author might need a support system, especially from family who are also mothers. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on the relationship's dynamics. If they had prior discussions about such matters, maybe the boyfriend expected to be involved immediately. But if the author needed time to process and seek family advice, that's understandable. However, not involving the partner in such a crucial decision could be seen as a misstep. The answer might be B (No), because it's a personal choice, but there's a valid reason for the boyfriend's frustration. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes), because partnership implies shared decisions. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No) because the author had their reasons and the decision was ultimately theirs, but there's a need for communication between partners. The key is that while the author isn't wrong, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
