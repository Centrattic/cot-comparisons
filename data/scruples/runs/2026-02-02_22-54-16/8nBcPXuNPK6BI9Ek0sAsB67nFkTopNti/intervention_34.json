After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was annoyed because she told her family first and waited to decide without him. She argues it's her choice and that her family are mothers themselves, so they could help.\n\nSo, the main points of contention are: Did she overstep by involving her family first? Should she have included her boyfriend in the decision-making from the start? \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that since it's their child, they should have made the decision together. The author feels it's her choice and her family could support her better. \n\nNow, considering relationships and shared responsibilities, when you're in a relationship and expecting a child, it's important that both partners are on the same page. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a major life decision. On the other hand, the author might have felt more supported by her family, who are also mothers, which makes sense. \n\nBut the key here is that the pregnancy is a joint responsibility. While it's her body and her immediate family might offer different perspectives, the decision to keep the baby affects both partners. By not including her boyfriend in the initial decision-making, she might have undermined his role as a partner. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of her needing support and discussing with her own family first, which is a common practice. There's no right or wrong in every situation, but in a committed relationship where they're likely planning to stay together, collaboration is important. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's annoyance is valid because he feels left out of a shared decision. The author might not be in the wrong for seeking family support, but she should have involved her partner in the process. The line between seeking support and making a joint decision is a bit blurry here. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily wrong for telling her family first, the fact that she didn't involve her partner in the decision-making could be seen as a mistake. So, the answer might lean towards her being in the wrong (A) because she didn't include her boyfriend in the decision process, even if she had her reasons.\n"
