After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant and immediately called her mother and sister. She then took a few days to think things over, discussing it with her family, and decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was upset because she went to her family first and made decisions without him. The author argues that it was her choice and she doesn't feel wrong, especially since her family are mothers themselves.\n\nSo, the main issue is about communication in the relationship. The boyfriend felt left out of the decision-making process, which is valid because a pregnancy affects both partners. On the other hand, the author might have sought support from her family first, which is also common. However, in a committed relationship, major life decisions like this typically require mutual discussion. By waiting to tell her boyfriend and making the decision before involving him, the author might have breached the trust or partnership aspect. \n\nBut the answer isn't black and white. The boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be included in decisions affecting both of them. The author's reasoning is that it was her choice and her family's support was important. However, even if it's her body, the decision to keep the child impacts both their lives. So, while she had her reasons, the key point is that the boyfriend was left out of the initial decision. That could be seen as a mistake in communication, making the author at least partially in the wrong. But some might argue that consulting family first isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt it was a joint decision, so the author might be in the wrong for not including him from the start.\n"
