He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. From the scenario, the author found out she's pregnant, did two positive tests, and then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react and took a few days to think things over while discussing with her family. She decided to keep the baby, then told her boyfriend, who was okay but annoyed that she told her family first and made decisions without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships. Generally, in a committed relationship, major life decisions like having a child are expected to be made jointly. The boyfriend argues that it's their child, so they should have discussed it together. The author, however, felt it was her choice and that talking to her family was necessary, especially since they are mothers themselves and could provide support.\n\nThe key points here are the timing and the process of decision-making. The author told her family first because she was uncertain and needed their input. But the boyfriend wasn't part of the initial decision-making. Even though the author eventually shared the decision with him and he was okay, the fact that she made a choice without including him might be an issue. While family support is important, the partner is equally a part of the future of the child. So, maybe the author should have informed her boyfriend first, even if she needed time to process and consult her family. However, it's also understandable that she might have had concerns about his reaction and sought reassurance from her family. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is about being excluded from the process. The author's reasoning that it's her choice is valid to an extent, especially if she's in a situation where she needs to make decisions quickly. Yet, in a committed relationship, it's usually expected to involve the partner in such significant decisions. So there's a balance between seeking support and making joint decisions. The answer might depend on the relationship's norms and how the boyfriend was treated. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because she did eventually inform him and he was okay with the decision, but the fact that she made the decision without him could be problematic. The boyfriend's annoyance is about not being included, which is a reasonable expectation in a partnership. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility here, but it's not necessarily all her fault. Maybe the answer is A, but I need to check if there are other factors. The post doesn't mention if the boyfriend was aware of the pregnancy beforehand or if they have a history of decision-making. Assuming they are in a relationship where major decisions are shared, the author's approach might be seen as not including her partner, making her partially at fault. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she did involve her family but not her partner, and the partner felt it was their child, the answer could be A. However, if the partner was not the father or not in a committed relationship, it would be different. The post says \"my boyfriend,\" so likely a committed relationship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
