After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman found out she was pregnant and immediately informed her family. She took time to think and discuss with them before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels it's their child and they should have made the decision together.\n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, sharing such news with family might be natural, especially since they are mothers and can offer support. It's her body, and she might feel more comfortable discussing it with her own first. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel left out or not trusted with the decision-making. He could see it as a joint responsibility.\n\nBut the author argues that it's her choice and she doesn't feel wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but does that make her wrong? There's no absolute right or wrong here, but it's more about communication and mutual respect. If she had discussed the decision with him before informing her family, that might have been better. However, she did involve her family in discussions before telling him. The timing and order might have been an oversight, but her actions don't necessarily make her wrong. It's a situation where both parties need to communicate better rather than assign blame. So, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
