After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think things over and discuss it with her family before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was okay with the decision but was annoyed that she told her family first and decided without him. He feels it should have been a joint decision because it's their child.\n\nThe author thinks she's not in the wrong because it's her choice and her family, especially since they are mothers. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, with options A or B.\n\nHmm. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. The boyfriend might feel left out of the decision-making process, which is understandable. But the author did eventually tell him and they're moving forward. She might have felt the need to talk to her family first, especially since they have experience as mothers. \n\nBut is it wrong to tell family first? It depends on the couple's dynamics. If there's an expectation to discuss major life events together, then perhaps she should have included him first. However, the author might not have known how he'd react and wanted to process it with her family first. \n\nThe key points are: Did she consult her boyfriend before making the decision? The author did wait a few days and discussed with her family before telling him. The boyfriend was upset about not being involved in the initial decision. \n\nIn many relationships, major decisions about children are joint, so the boyfriend's reaction is valid. But the author's action might be seen as her right to consult her family first, especially given the emotional weight of the situation. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the couple had prior expectations of discussing such news together, then she might be in the wrong. But without prior discussion, her actions could be seen as her way of processing the news. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because it's her body and she chose to involve her family, but the boyfriend's feelings are also valid. However, the fact that she didn't involve him in the initial decision could be seen as a mistake. But since she did tell him eventually and they decided to proceed, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong, but it's a situation where both have valid perspectives. The boyfriend's feelings are important, but the author's actions were her way of handling the news.\n"
