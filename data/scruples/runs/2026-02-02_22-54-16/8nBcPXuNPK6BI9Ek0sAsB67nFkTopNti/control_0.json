After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out they're pregnant, took a few days to decide whether to keep it, discussed with family, then told the boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together. The author thinks they're not wrong because it's their choice and they talked to family, who are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are communication and shared decision-making. The boyfriend feels it's their child, so the decision should be mutual. The author feels it's their choice and that discussing with family was necessary. \n\nI should consider cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In many relationships, big decisions like pregnancy are expected to be discussed together. But the author might feel that consulting their own family was important for support. Did the author consider the boyfriend's perspective earlier? They mentioned waiting a few days to think and discuss with family first. That could be where the conflict arises. \n\nThe boyfriend was upset because he wasn't involved from the start. Even though the author decided to keep the pregnancy, involving the partner in the process might be important for the relationship's health. However, the author might not have known how the boyfriend would react initially, so taking time to think makes sense. But once a decision is made, sharing it with the partner is essential. \n\nIs the author wrong for not including the boyfriend in the initial decision-making process? It depends on the relationship's expectations. Some would argue that major life decisions should be a team effort. Others might see consulting one's own family as a natural step. \n\nThe author's reasoning is valid, but maybe they should have informed the boyfriend earlier. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer depends on whether shared decision-making is a priority in their relationship. Since the author's actions were based on their own judgment and the boyfriend is now informed, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But there's a valid point in the boyfriend's reaction. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because it's their body and they had a right to process the news. But there's room for improvement in communication moving forward.\n"
