After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend later after thinking it over. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are communication and shared decision-making. The author mentions that she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took time to think and discussed it with her family first. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, wanted to be part of the decision-making process. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that it's her body and her choice, especially since her family are mothers themselves and could offer advice. The boyfriend's point is that it's their child and they should have made the decision together. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are usually important. By not informing her boyfriend first, maybe she didn't give him a chance to be involved in the initial decision-making. However, she did eventually tell him and he was okay with the pregnancy. But the issue is the delay and not including him in the decision process from the start.\n\nBut does that make her wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She might have felt she needed support from her family first, which is understandable. However, in a committed relationship, major decisions like this are typically expected to be made jointly. So the boyfriend's reaction is valid. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but socially, maybe. It depends on the expectations in the relationship. If they had an understanding that such decisions would be made together, then she might be wrong. If not, maybe not. The question is whether the act of telling family first without the boyfriend is wrong.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because it's a situation where she sought support and made the decision, which is her right. However, the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, which is a matter of opinion. Since she did eventually involve the boyfriend and the decision was made, perhaps she isn't wrong. Alternatively, the fact that she didn't consult him first could be seen as wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt left out. But the author explains her reasoning. In such cases, it's often a mix of both perspectives. However, the question is a yes/no, A/B. In typical AITA scenarios, the answer often depends on the context. Here, since the author made the decision before involving her family, and then told the boyfriend, maybe the boyfriend's reaction is valid but the author isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
