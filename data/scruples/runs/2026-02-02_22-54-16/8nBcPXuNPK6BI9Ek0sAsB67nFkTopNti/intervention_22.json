After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her family first, then her boyfriend later. He's upset because he thinks they should have decided together.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about communication and partnership. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process. The author defends her actions by saying it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing such big news with family first might be seen as seeking support, especially since they are experienced mothers. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that since it's their child, he should have been involved from the start. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's her choice, but pregnancy does affect both partners. However, the decision to keep the baby was made after consulting with her family, but the boyfriend wasn't included in the initial decision. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded, which is valid because major life decisions involving both partners should ideally include both. \n\nBut whether that makes the author \"in the wrong\" depends on cultural or personal expectations. If the boyfriend expected to be the first person she told, then she might have breached his expectations. However, if the author felt she needed to process the news with her family first, that's understandable too. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if the intention was to seek support and she later included her boyfriend in the decision. The boyfriend's reaction is more about communication and expectations. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were done in bad faith. Since she did involve her boyfriend eventually and he's the one who's upset about the timing, it's more about their dynamic. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both could have communicated better.\n"
