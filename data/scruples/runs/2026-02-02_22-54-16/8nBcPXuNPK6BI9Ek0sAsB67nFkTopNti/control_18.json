After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she was pregnant, took two tests, then told her mom and sister first. She waited a few days to decide with her family before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child. The author thinks she's not wrong because her family are mothers and she needed their support.\n\nSo, the main question is about who should have been informed first. The boyfriend argues it's their child, so they should have discussed it together. The author believes consulting her family was necessary and she made the right choice.\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics. In many relationships, major decisions like having a child are expected to be mutual. However, the author might have felt the need to talk to her family first for support and guidance. But the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of a joint decision.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's subjective. The author acted in her way, but the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The key is whether informing her family before the partner is a breach of trust or communication. Some might say the partner should be the first to know, others might say consulting family is normal. The author's reasoning about her family being mothers is a point, but the boyfriend's reaction is about inclusion in the decision.\n\nThe answer might depend on the couple's communication norms. If they usually make big decisions together, then the author might be in the wrong. But if family support is a priority, then maybe not. Since the boyfriend was upset, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but could have handled it differently. The question is whether she was wrong. Since the situation is complex and both sides have points, but the boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility, maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit unsure. However, given that the author had a reason and the boyfriend's reaction is about the process, the answer could be B. Hmm. Need to decide.\n"
