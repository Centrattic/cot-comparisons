After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She then took a few days to think things over, discussing it with her family. She decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was upset because she told her family first and waited a few days to decide without him. He felt they should have decided together since it's their child. The author sees her point but doesn't feel wrong because she talked to her family, who are mothers themselves.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did she wrong her boyfriend by not telling him first and involving her family before him? The boyfriend's argument is about shared decision-making, while the author's defense is about consulting her own family and making the decision herself.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, relationship expectations, and communication. In many relationships, big decisions like pregnancy are seen as joint. However, the author might feel that her family, being mothers, could provide support and insight. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is about not being included in the initial decision-making process. The author made a decision without him, which could be seen as not respecting his partnership. On the other hand, she did eventually tell him and included him in the next steps. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It might depend on the expectations of both partners. If the relationship is such that major life decisions are made together, then the author might be in the wrong for not involving him immediately. However, if the author felt she needed family support first, maybe it's understandable. \n\nBut since the question is about whether she's in the wrong, the answer might hinge on the importance of shared decisions. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's the father. However, the author's actions might be seen as self-centered if she didn't consider his perspective first. \n\nBut some might argue that consulting her own family is acceptable, especially given their experience. The key is whether she was respectful of their partnership. Since she did tell him eventually and he was part of the next steps, maybe she isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No) because she had her reasons and eventually included him. However, there's a valid point that she could have informed him first. But since the user is asking if she's in the wrong, the answer might be B because her actions were her choice, and the boyfriend's reaction is valid but doesn't necessarily make her wrong.\n"
