After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then took a few days to think it over. She decided to keep the baby and then told her boyfriend. He was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms around such situations. In many relationships, big decisions like this are expected to be mutual. However, the author might have felt the need to discuss it with her family first, especially since they are mothers themselves. She might have felt their support was necessary, or maybe she was uncertain about how her boyfriend would react.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about wanting to be involved in the decision-making process. He might feel that since it's their child, he should have been part of the initial discussions. The author, on the other hand, might believe that seeking family input is normal, especially for emotional support.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's subjective. Some might say the author acted in her own way, which is her right, while others might argue that involving the partner first is important. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author did eventually involve her boyfriend, but the timing and approach might be the issue. She considered her family's perspectives, which is valid, but the boyfriend might have felt excluded initially.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she made a personal decision. However, not consulting her boyfriend first could be seen as not respecting his role as a partner. The answer depends on the dynamics of their relationship and how they handle such decisions. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, there's no clear-cut answer, but the answer would likely be B (No), as she's not necessarily wrong, though there's room for discussion on partnership aspects.\n"
