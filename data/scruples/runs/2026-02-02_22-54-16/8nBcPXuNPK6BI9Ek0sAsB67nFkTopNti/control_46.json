After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first before telling her boyfriend, then told him after deciding to keep the baby. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have discussed it together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that her family, being mothers themselves, could give her support and advice, and she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react. She might have wanted to process the news with her own family first. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel left out of the decision-making process. He could see it as a shared responsibility, so not involving him immediately might hurt his feelings and create a sense of being excluded.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because major life decisions like having a child definitely involve both partners. However, the author's actions can be seen as seeking support from her family, which is also normal. But maybe she should have discussed the plan with her boyfriend first, even if she was unsure of his reaction. The fact that she waited a few days and only told him after the decision might have made him feel like he wasn't part of the process. \n\nIs she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She wasn't wrong for seeking family support, but maybe she could have involved her boyfriend sooner. The boyfriend's feelings are important too. The key point is that while it's okay to talk to family, major decisions affecting both partners should be made together. So maybe she did something that could be seen as wrong by not including her boyfriend in the initial decision-making process, even if her intentions were good.\n"
