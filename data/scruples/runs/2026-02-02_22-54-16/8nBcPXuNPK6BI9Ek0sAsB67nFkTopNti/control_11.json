After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, took a few days to think, then told her boyfriend. He was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together as it's their child.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the order of disclosure and the decision-making process. The author says she told her family first because she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react and wanted to discuss it with her family first. The boyfriend felt left out of the decision, which is understandable because it is their child. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics, in a relationship, major decisions like having a child typically involve both partners. However, the author might have felt uncertain about how to proceed and sought support from her family, especially since they are mothers. But the boyfriend's reaction is also valid because he might feel that his partner bypassed him in the decision-making process.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, she had the right to seek support from her family. On the other, the decision affects both partners, so involving the boyfriend earlier would have been better. But she did eventually tell him, and he was okay with the decision. The main issue is communication and timing.\n\nIn many relationships, transparency and communication are key. If one partner makes a significant decision without the other, even if it's to discuss with family first, it can lead to feelings of exclusion. However, the author's intention was to process the news and seek support before making the decision. \n\nSo, is she wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on cultural norms, relationship expectations, and how the couple communicates. If they don't have prior agreements on such matters, it's easy for misunderstandings to happen. But since the author did involve her boyfriend eventually and he accepted the decision, maybe the main issue was the timing. However, the boyfriend's reaction shows that he felt it was important to be included from the start. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions aren't malicious, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The decision to involve family first without informing the partner might be seen as a misstep in communication. But ultimately, it's a situation where both parties might need to adjust their expectations. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because she didn't include her boyfriend first. But others might argue B (No) because she had her reasons and the decision was ultimately made. \n\nHmm, tricky. But in most cases, when it's a shared life decision, both partners should be involved. So maybe A is the answer. But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The author said she told her family first because she wasn't sure how the boyfriend would take it. Maybe she thought she needed support before telling him. However, the boyfriend felt it should have been a joint decision. So the wrong is on the author for not involving him from the start. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
