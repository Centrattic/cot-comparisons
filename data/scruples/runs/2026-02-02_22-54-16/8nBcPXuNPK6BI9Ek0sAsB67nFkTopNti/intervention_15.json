After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her family first, then her boyfriend. He's upset because he feels they should have discussed it together since it's their child.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about communication in a relationship. The author says she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would take it, so she took time to think with her family. She decided to keep the baby and then told him. He was annoyed because he felt they should have made the decision together.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author might have felt the need to talk to her family first, especially since they are mothers themselves. They could provide support and perspective. Also, she mentions she discussed it with her family over a few days before telling her boyfriend. But her boyfriend feels that as a couple, they should have made the decision together. \n\nBut pregnancy decisions do involve both partners. The author might have acted out of fear of how her boyfriend would react, maybe thinking he might not be supportive. However, keeping such a significant decision from a partner, even if it's for a few days, could be seen as not being fully transparent. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's part of the partnership now, and major life decisions like having a child should be mutual.\n\nBut then again, the author might not feel comfortable making such a big decision alone, especially if there's a chance of conflict. She might have wanted to process the news with her family first to get their input. The issue is whether it's wrong to not include the partner in the initial decision-making.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the level of communication between the two. If the boyfriend is the other parent, he should be involved in such decisions. However, the author might have had reasons for delaying, like anxiety or uncertainty. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should be on the same page for such matters. The author's action could be seen as not respecting her boyfriend's role in the decision, even if her intentions were good. So maybe the answer is A (yes, she's in the wrong), but some might argue B (no). But considering that the decision affects both partners, I think A is more appropriate.\n"
