After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before telling her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together. The author thinks she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasoning is that it's her decision and her family can provide support. The boyfriend's concern is about shared responsibility since it's their child. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did eventually tell her boyfriend, but the timing and the fact that she discussed it with her family first without him could be a point of contention. However, whether she's in the wrong depends on cultural norms, the couple's prior agreements, and the context of their relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about wanting joint decision-making. The author's action was to seek support from her family, which is common. But if the couple had discussed such situations before, her actions might be seen as going against agreed-upon communication. However, since there's no mention of prior discussions, it's hard to say if she violated an agreement.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both parties have valid points. The author acted in her need for support, while the boyfriend feels excluded from a major decision. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were within the bounds of their relationship's dynamics. Since the author didn't mention prior conflicts or agreements, it's possible she's not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in future communication.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The decision to inform family first isn't inherently wrong, especially when seeking support. The boyfriend's reaction is valid but doesn't make her wrong. The situation highlights the importance of discussing such matters together, but the initial action doesn't necessarily make her at fault.\n"
