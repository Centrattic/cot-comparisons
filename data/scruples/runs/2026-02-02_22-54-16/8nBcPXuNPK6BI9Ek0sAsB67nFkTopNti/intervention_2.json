He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before their boyfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found out they're pregnant. They took two tests, then called their mom and sister. They mention that they weren't sure how their boyfriend would react, so they took a few days to think it over and discuss with family. Later, they told the boyfriend, who was \"pretty great about it,\" but then he got annoyed because the author had already told their families and made the decision to keep the child before involving him. The boyfriend's main point is that the decision should be mutual since it's their child, not hers alone.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about communication and decision-making in the relationship. The author believes it's their right to inform their family and make the decision first, given that her mother and sister are mothers themselves. The boyfriend feels left out of the process, which is a valid concern. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics, when a couple is in a committed relationship, major life decisions like having a child typically require mutual agreement. However, the author might have felt uncertain about the boyfriend's reaction and wanted to consult her family first. That makes sense because she was preparing for different outcomes and seeking support from her own family, who are experienced in parenting. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is also understandable. He might feel that he's a partner and should be involved in these discussions. The fact that the author told her family before him could be seen as a breach of partnership. However, it's not clear if the author intended to exclude him. She did mention discussing it with her family before making a decision, but once she made up her mind, she informed her boyfriend. \n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend and the author had prior discussions about such situations. If they had talked about how to handle a pregnancy, maybe the approach would be different. But since the author didn't know his reaction, her decision to involve her family first might be justified. However, in a relationship, transparency and communication are crucial. The author might have been better off discussing her intentions with her boyfriend earlier, even if she was unsure about his reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is the one who is directly affected by the pregnancy and has the medical and emotional experience of it. Decisions about pregnancy involve her health and well-being, so it's her right to make that choice, especially in the initial stages when she's still processing the information. \n\nThe boyfriend's annoyance is valid because he wants to be included in major decisions, but the author's actions don't necessarily make her wrong. It's a situation where both partners might need to communicate better. The author might have handled it differently by telling her boyfriend first, but given her uncertainty, her approach isn't entirely incorrect. \n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The decision to seek family support first is understandable, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about communication and partnership dynamics rather than the author being objectively wrong.\n"
