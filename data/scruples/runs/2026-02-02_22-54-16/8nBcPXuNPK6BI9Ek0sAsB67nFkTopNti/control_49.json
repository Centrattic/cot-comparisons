After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister first. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she waited a few days to think it over with her family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was okay with the decision to keep the child but was annoyed that she told her family first and didn't involve him in the decision-making process.\n\nThe boyfriend's main issue is that he feels they should have decided together because it's their child. The author thinks it's her choice and she doesn't feel wrong about talking to her family, especially since they are mothers themselves.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships often involve communication and mutual decision-making. The author did make a big life decision without her partner, which could be seen as not considering his input. However, she did eventually share the decision with him and they had a discussion. Her reasoning is that she felt the need to talk to her family, who are mothers, which might have been for support.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility. It's understandable that he would feel left out of a decision that affects both of them. Even if she had good reasons, not including him in the initial decision could be seen as a misstep in partnership.\n\nBut whether it's \"wrong\" is subjective. The author might not be wrong from her perspective, but she might have hurt her boyfriend's feelings. The key here is that the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether her boyfriend is right. In many relationships, partners expect to be part of major decisions, especially those involving their future. So, while her actions were motivated by seeking support, withholding that information from her partner until after discussing with her family might be considered a breach of trust or partnership.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because in a committed relationship, both partners should be involved in major decisions that affect both of them. Even if she needed support from her family, the primary decision-making should involve her partner, especially since it's their child together.\n"
