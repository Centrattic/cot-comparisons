After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together, as it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author made the decision to tell her family first, perhaps to get their support or to process it herself. She mentions that her family are mothers themselves, so maybe she felt they could offer advice. However, the boyfriend felt left out of the decision-making process, which is important because it's their shared responsibility.\n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to seek her family's support. Pregnancy is a big life event, and discussing it with close family members is common. She also decided to keep the child, which is her personal choice, and her family might be important in that journey.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is valid too. He might feel that since it's their child, he should have been part of the initial discussion and decision-making. Not informing him first could make him feel excluded or not trusted. Relationships often require mutual decision-making, especially regarding future plans.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to seek support and the boyfriend's need for inclusion. The author might not be in the wrong because she had her reasons, but there's a valid reason for the boyfriend's annoyance. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since both perspectives have merit, but the decision to share with her family first isn't inherently wrong, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). The main issue is communication and considering the partner's feelings, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong, just that there's room for understanding both sides.\n"
