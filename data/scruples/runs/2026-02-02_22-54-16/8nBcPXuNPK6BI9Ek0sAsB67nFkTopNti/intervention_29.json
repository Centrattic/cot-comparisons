After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The author found out she was pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nHmm. The author mentions she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would take it and took time to discuss with her family. She kept the decision to herself until she felt ready. The boyfriend was okay with the pregnancy but upset about not being included in the initial decision. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the decision is a big one, and involving the boyfriend is important since it's their child. But on the other hand, the author is the one carrying the pregnancy, and her family might have been a source of support. She did eventually tell her boyfriend and they discussed it. \n\nThe key points are: she told her family first because she was unsure, then decided to keep the baby. The boyfriend felt left out. But the author believes she isn't wrong because it's her body and her family are mothers. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. However, the author did share the decision with her boyfriend eventually, and he was okay with it. The timing might be an issue, but she had her reasons. It's a gray area. Opinions can vary. Some might say they should have discussed it together from the start. Others might agree that the author needed time to process with her family. \n\nI think the answer depends on the relationship's norms. If the boyfriend felt excluded, it's a valid concern. But the author wasn't necessarily in the wrong since it's her decision and she did involve her support system. So probably answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
