After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The author found out she was pregnant, told her family first, then her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had two positive tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think it over and discuss with her family before telling her boyfriend. Then she decided to keep the child. When she told her boyfriend, he was upset because he felt it's their child and they should have made the decision together. The author argues that it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's decision to inform her family first might be seen as prioritizing her support system, especially since her mom and sister are mothers. However, the boyfriend's reaction is based on the idea that it's their shared future, so he feels left out of the decision-making process. \n\nI think the key here is the communication and the context. The author didn't hide the pregnancy from her boyfriend; she just told her family first. She did inform him eventually, and he was actually \"pretty great\" about it. The issue is more about the order of informing and the decision-making process. \n\nThe boyfriend might feel that being in a committed relationship, decisions about a shared child should be made jointly. However, the author's actions were to seek support from her family, which is a common and understandable step. She didn't keep it a secret from him; she just involved her family first. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author's actions could be seen as seeking support from her own family, which is her right. On the other hand, the boyfriend's perspective is about partnership and shared decisions. But the author didn't do anything harmful. The problem here is more about the relationship communication and expectations rather than the author being wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. She made a personal choice to involve her family first, which is valid. The boyfriend's feelings are legitimate, but the author isn't at fault for seeking support from her family. The issue might be more about how they communicate and handle decisions together in the future.\n"
