After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her family first, then the boyfriend found out and was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that it was her choice and she wanted to discuss things with her family, who are also mothers. The boyfriend is upset because it's their child and he felt left out of the decision-making process.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual decision-making in a relationship. Typically, in a committed relationship, major life decisions like having a child are expected to be made together. However, the author might have had reasons for involving her family first, like seeking support or advice, especially if the boyfriend's reaction was uncertain.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is valid too. He was left out of the loop, which could make him feel neglected or not trusted. The question is whether the author acted unilaterally without considering the partnership aspect. However, the author did mention that after deciding to keep the child, she informed the boyfriend, and he was okay with it. The issue is the order of communication.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author might not be in the wrong because she was processing her thoughts and seeking support from her family, which is natural. On the other hand, not including the partner immediately could be seen as not valuing their partnership. The answer might hinge on the relationship dynamics and how both parties communicate their needs. Since the author did involve her boyfriend eventually and he accepted the decision, maybe the initial choice wasn't wrong, but the communication could have been better. The user's own opinion is that the author is not in the wrong, so I should consider that. But I need to make sure the answer is based on the situation given, not just my own feelings. The key is whether the action was wrong. Since the author had reasons and the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded, but she did involve her family for support, which is understandable. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
