After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her family first, then her boyfriend. He's upset because he feels they should have made the decision together.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about decision-making in an intimate relationship. The author explains she told her family first because she wasn't sure how her boyfriend would take it and needed time to think. Her boyfriend is upset because he feels the decision should be mutual, as it's their child.\n\nFrom a relational standpoint, communication is crucial. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because major life decisions, especially about having a child, typically involve both partners. However, the author's reasoning is that she needed support from her family and that it's her body, so she has the right to make the initial decision. \n\nBut wait, while it's her body, pregnancy is a shared life event. Telling family first might have been a way to seek advice, but maybe she should have discussed it with her boyfriend earlier. The boyfriend's feelings of being left out are understandable. However, the author might not feel in the wrong because she involved her family who are also mothers and knew they'd support her.\n\nI need to consider cultural and personal factors. In some cultures, family might be more involved in such decisions. Also, the author might have felt more comfortable with her family first. But in a relationship, both partners usually expect to be part of major decisions. \n\nThe question is whether her actions were wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. She might not be in the wrong because she had her reasons and made a decision, but she should have considered her boyfriend's perspective and maybe communicated better. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also about feeling excluded. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the norms of the relationship. If the couple had prior agreements about such matters, that's one thing. But in general, sharing this news with family first might be seen as a mistake in communication. However, the author's intent was to process the news and seek support. \n\nI think the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because it's her body and she had support from her family. But the situation could have been handled better with more discussion between the couple. However, the question is strictly whether she's in the wrong. Since she made a choice that's her right, but the boyfriend's feelings are valid. But the answer is probably B, No, she isn't in the wrong.\n"
