After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think things over with her family before telling her boyfriend. When she did tell him, he was annoyed because he felt they should have discussed it together since it's their child. The author sees her mom and sister as mothers themselves, so they could help her decide. She thinks her choice is valid, but her boyfriend feels left out.\n\nNow, I need to decide if she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication in a relationship and shared decision-making. The boyfriend's argument is that it's their child, so they should have discussed it together. The author, however, felt it was her choice and turned to her family first. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate major life decisions with each other. However, the author's decision to consult her family might be seen as seeking support, which is understandable. The issue is not necessarily who told first, but that the author didn't involve her partner in the initial decision-making process. Her boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a joint decision. \n\nBut then, pregnancy is a significant life event, and the mother's role in making decisions about her body is fundamental. The author might not be wrong in seeking her family's support, especially since they are mothers. However, the boyfriend's feelings of being left out are valid too. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. \n\nIn many cases, it's expected that couples discuss such matters together. The author didn't do that, which could be seen as a misstep. But she did make the choice to keep the pregnancy and then informed her boyfriend. The boyfriend's annoyance is about the process, not the outcome. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the couple had a prior understanding about making big decisions together, then yes. But if not, her consulting her family might be justified. However, the fact that the boyfriend felt excluded suggests that she should have included him in the discussion. Therefore, maybe she's in the wrong for not involving him. But others might argue that her decision to seek family support is her right. \n\nHmm. I think the answer hinges on whether the decision required joint discussion. Since it's their child, the boyfriend's perspective is valid. The author made the decision without him, which could be seen as a mistake. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong). But some might say no because it's her body. It's tricky. The key here is that the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether the boyfriend's reaction is valid. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But according to relationship norms, she might be. I'm leaning towards A because the decision affects both partners and should be discussed together. However, the initial notification to family isn't necessarily wrong if she intended to tell her partner next. Wait, she did tell her partner after the decision. The problem is the decision-making process. She made the decision with her family without including her partner. That's the crux. So, maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is B if the focus is on her right to make the decision and seek support.\n"
