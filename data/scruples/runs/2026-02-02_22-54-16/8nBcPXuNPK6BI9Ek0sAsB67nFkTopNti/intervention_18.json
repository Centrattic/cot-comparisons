After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then waited a few days to discuss with her family before informing her boyfriend. The boyfriend was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that she was unsure how her boyfriend would take the news and wanted to discuss it with her family first. Her family are both mothers, so maybe she felt they could offer support. The boyfriend's reaction is that he felt left out of the decision-making process. \n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, communication is key. The boyfriend might feel that major life decisions involving both partners should be made jointly. The author, on the other hand, felt it was her choice, especially since it's her body and she might have been uncertain about his reaction. \n\nI should think about whether there's a cultural or social norm here. In some relationships, partners expect to be the first to know about significant news like a pregnancy. The author might have valid reasons for consulting her family first, but the boyfriend's feelings about joint decision-making are also important.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. It's a bit subjective. The author isn't lying or hiding information; she just sought support from her family first. The boyfriend's annoyance is about the process of decision-making. The author does acknowledge his point but still feels she wasn't wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on mutual respect and communication. If the author had considered her boyfriend's perspective and possibly discussed with him earlier, even if she needed family support, it might have been better. But given that she eventually told him and made the decision to keep the child, maybe she isn't in the wrong. The key is whether the boyfriend felt excluded, which is a relationship issue that might require discussion rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
