After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that she told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have discussed it together.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman found out she was pregnant, told her family first, then her boyfriend. She wanted to process the news with her family and discussed it with them before making a decision to keep the child. When she told her boyfriend, he was annoyed because he feels it's their child and they should have made the decision together.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) She told her family first. 2) She discussed with her family and made a decision before telling her boyfriend. 3) The boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility. 4) The woman feels her choice was valid because her family could support her, and it's her body/choice.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. In many relationships, major life decisions like pregnancy are expected to be mutual. However, the woman's reasoning is that she needed support from her family, especially since they are mothers themselves. She also mentions that the boyfriend's reaction came after she already told her family, not before.\n\nThe boyfriend's annoyance is about feeling excluded from the decision-making process. But the woman didn't hide the pregnancy from him; she told him eventually and made a decision. The timing and communication style matter here. If she had told her family first, then immediately told him, maybe the reaction would be different. But she took a few days to process, which might have made him feel left out.\n\nLegally and ethically, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. However, in a relationship, communication is key. The fact that the boyfriend was \"annoyed\" but not angry might suggest it's more about his feelings of being excluded rather than a major betrayal.\n\nThe woman's actions don't seem malicious. She wasn't hiding the pregnancy but sought support from her family first. The boyfriend's reaction is valid in the sense that he wants to be part of the decision-making process. But since the woman did involve him eventually and made a decision that they both can live with (keeping the child), maybe the issue is more about communication timing than the decision itself.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a close call. On one hand, she made a decision that affects both of them without immediate discussion. On the other, she had support from her family and communicated her decision once she was ready. The boyfriend's upset reaction is understandable but not necessarily a sign that the woman was wrong. The key is whether her actions were intentional to hurt him or if it was a need for support. Since she didn't hide it and shared the decision once ready, B (No) seems more appropriate.\n"
