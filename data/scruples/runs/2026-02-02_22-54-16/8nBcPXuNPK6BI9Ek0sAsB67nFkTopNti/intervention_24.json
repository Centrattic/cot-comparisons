After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then decided to keep the child. She told her boyfriend later, and he was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together. She thinks she's right because it's her choice and her family knows about pregnancies.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because it's their child, so he might feel excluded. But pregnancy decisions often involve the woman's immediate decisions, especially in the early stages. The author's mom and sister are mothers themselves, so she might have sought their support, which is common.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a bit subjective. The author isn't necessarily wrong for involving her family first, especially if she felt the need for their input. However, not including her boyfriend in the initial decision could be seen as a point of contention. The boyfriend's feelings are important too; partnership implies shared decisions, especially regarding a child.\n\nBut the decision to keep the child isn't solely up to the woman? Well, legally and medically, it's her decision. However, in a relationship, communication is key. She did tell him eventually, and he was okay with it. The issue was the delay and not involving him in the initial decision-making process. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Maybe not, but there's room for misunderstanding. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and how the relationship is structured. The author's reasoning makes sense, but the boyfriend's perspective is also valid. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she took his feelings into account and acknowledged his point, but still felt her actions were justified, it's a nuanced situation.\n\nMost people might side with her because she's not obligated to consult her partner first on a decision that's primarily hers to make, especially given the immediate need for family support. But others might argue that transparency and inclusion in such a major decision is essential. Given the context, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
