After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The author found out she was pregnant, told her family first, took a few days to think, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset that she went to her family first and made decisions without him. The author feels she's not in the wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about communication in a relationship. The author made a decision that her boyfriend didn't agree with. The boyfriend feels that since it's their child, they should have discussed it together. The author, on the other hand, felt it was her right to consult her family first.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. In a relationship, major decisions like this usually require mutual discussion. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable because he might feel left out. However, the author's actions were based on her need to involve her family, who are mothers, which could provide emotional support. \n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't inform her boyfriend immediately. She took a few days to decide, consulting her family instead. This could be seen as not considering her partner's role in the decision-making process. The boyfriend's point is that it's their child, so joint decision-making is important. \n\nHowever, the author might feel that her family's input is necessary, especially since they have experience as mothers. But from the boyfriend's perspective, it's a shared responsibility. So, there's a conflict here between individual autonomy and partnership in decision-making.\n\nIn many relationships, it's expected that both partners discuss major life events together. By not informing her boyfriend first, the author might have overstepped, especially since the decision affects both of them. On the other hand, if the author felt she needed support from her family, that's also valid. But the timing and approach matter. Perhaps she could have informed her boyfriend first while still seeking her family's advice.\n\nI think the answer here is a bit nuanced. But according to the user's question, they want a simple A or B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate. The boyfriend's reaction is about being involved in the decision. The author made a choice without him, which could be seen as wrong in the context of a partnership. However, it's her body, and she's the one experiencing the pregnancy. So, there's a balance between personal autonomy and shared responsibility.\n\nIn some situations, consulting family is normal. But in a relationship, big decisions usually require both partners. The fact that she waited a few days to decide without her partner could be problematic. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't include her partner in the initial decision-making process, even though her reasons are understandable. Alternatively, if the context allows for family support, maybe B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut the key issue is whether it's her choice alone. The author says it's her choice, but the child is theirs. So, while the decision to have the child is hers, the partnership aspect implies that both should be involved. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing it with her boyfriend first. So answer A.\n"
