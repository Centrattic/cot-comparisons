After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she was pregnant, told her family first, took a few days to decide, then told her boyfriend. He was annoyed because he felt they should have decided together.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are communication and partnership. The author's boyfriend is upset because he feels excluded from the decision-making process. He argues that it's their child, so they should have made the decision together. The author, on the other hand, believes it's her choice and that discussing it with her family, who are mothers themselves, was appropriate.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and relationship expectations. In many relationships, major decisions like pregnancy are seen as joint responsibilities. However, the author might have had her reasons for consulting her family first\u2014maybe seeking support or advice. But by not including her boyfriend in the initial decision-making, she might have undermined his role in the partnership.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is valid because he wants to be involved in such a significant life event. The author did eventually involve him, but the delay and the decision made without him could have caused hurt. The key is whether the author's actions were disrespectful or dismissive of her partner's feelings. Even if her family's input was helpful, the boyfriend's feelings of being left out are important. The author might not feel in the wrong, but from a relational standpoint, it's possible she was wrong to not include him from the start. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. Alternatively, maybe the situation isn't black and white. However, the boyfriend's perspective is valid, so the author could be in the wrong for not consulting him first.\n"
