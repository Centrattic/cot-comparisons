After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before telling her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman found out she's pregnant. She took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with family. Then she told her boyfriend, who was understanding but annoyed that she told her family first and made decisions without him. The author argues that it's her choice and that her mom and sister are mothers themselves, so they could help.\n\nI need to decide if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks she's not in the wrong, so they want to know if I agree.\n\nLet me consider the factors. The main issue here is whether the author made a unilateral decision without involving her partner. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from the decision-making process. The author's reasoning is that she needed to process it first, especially since she wasn't sure how he'd react. Also, her family, being mothers, might provide support.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend might see the pregnancy as a shared responsibility, hence expecting to be involved in the decision to keep the baby. However, the author did eventually inform him and made the choice to keep the baby, which he was okay with. The timing and order of disclosure could be a point of contention. \n\nBut is it wrong? It's a judgment call. Some might say that even if she needed time, she should have at least discussed the plan with her partner before involving family. Others might see that she handled it with her close family first, who can offer emotional support, especially if the partner's reaction was a concern. \n\nThe author's point is valid: it's her body, and she has the right to make decisions. But the boyfriend's perspective is about shared parenthood. The fact that the author didn't involve him in the initial decision might lead to feelings of being left out, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. \n\nHowever, the author did eventually inform him and shared the decision, which he was okay with the outcome. The main issue is the order and consultation. In some cases, partners expect to be the first to know in such matters. The author might have thought she was acting in good faith by seeking family support before approaching her partner. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she had her reasons and the outcome was positive. The boyfriend's reaction is about the process rather than the result. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
