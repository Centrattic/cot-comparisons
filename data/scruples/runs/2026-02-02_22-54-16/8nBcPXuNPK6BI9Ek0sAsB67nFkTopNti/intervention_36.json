After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about the pregnancy before their boyfriend. The situation involves the author finding out they're pregnant, telling their family first, then discussing with their boyfriend later. The boyfriend is upset because he expected them to decide together since it's their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author told their family first because they were unsure how to proceed and wanted to discuss with their family, who are both mothers. The boyfriend felt left out and wanted to make the decision together. The author maintains that it was their choice and they don't feel wrong for involving their family.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. The boyfriend might feel it's a shared decision, especially since it affects both of them. However, the author might see it as their right to involve their family first, especially given their family's experience. \n\nI should think about cultural or personal expectations. In some cultures, family plays a significant role in such decisions. The author's reasoning is that their family can provide support, which makes sense. But the boyfriend's reaction is also valid because it's a joint life decision. \n\nHowever, the author did eventually tell the boyfriend and they decided to keep the child. The boyfriend's annoyance is about the sequence of communication. The author might not be in the wrong if they acted out of needing support, but maybe there's a lesson in discussing major life events together first. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the author had a reason to involve their family first, especially to discuss the decision, the answer might lean towards B. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for seeking family input first.\n"
