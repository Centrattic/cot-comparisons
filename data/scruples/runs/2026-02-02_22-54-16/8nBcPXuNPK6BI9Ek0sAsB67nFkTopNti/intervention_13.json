After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with her family. She decided to keep the baby, then told her boyfriend. He was upset because she told her family first and made decisions without him. He wanted them to decide together since it's their child. She thinks she's not wrong because it's her choice and her family are mothers themselves.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but they want my opinion. The answer should be A or B, which are yes or no.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the key points. The woman's actions: she told her family first, then waited a few days. Her boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together. She argues it's her choice, and her family's input is valid.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, sharing big life events with family can be common, especially when dealing with uncertainty. Her family, being mothers, might have been a source of support and advice. However, the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a major decision that affects both of them. The fact that she made the decision before discussing with him could be a point of contention.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, it's her body and her pregnancy. The decision to keep the baby is hers to make. However, involving the boyfriend in the process is important for a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is about partnership and shared responsibility. But the woman's actions might be seen as self-protective, especially if she was unsure of his reaction.\n\nThere's a balance here. The woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, but the boyfriend also has a right to be involved in decisions that affect their relationship. The fact that she told her family first might not be wrong per se, but not including him in the decision-making process could be a problem. However, since she did involve him eventually and he was okay about the pregnancy, maybe the issue was more about the process rather than the outcome.\n\nIn many cases, it's about communication and mutual respect. If she had discussed her reasons for involving her family first, maybe the boyfriend could have understood. But the key is that the decision to keep the baby was hers, which is her right. The boyfriend's frustration is valid, but does that make her wrong?\n\nI think the answer here is B (No). She's not in the wrong because it's her body and her choice. However, in a relationship, including the partner in such decisions is ideal, but since the decision was already made and the boyfriend was informed, the main issue is about the process. But ultimately, the decision to keep the baby is hers, so she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out, but that doesn't make her wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
