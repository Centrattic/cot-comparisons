After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling her mom and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: She found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then discussed with her family for a few days before telling her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have decided together since it's their child. She argues it was her choice, especially since her family are mothers themselves.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend's perspective is that it's their child, so the decision should be mutual. The author's side is that it's her body and her choice, and she leaned on her family for support since they're mothers.\n\nI need to consider both sides. In relationships, communication and mutual decision-making are key. However, when it comes to a pregnancy, the woman's body and health are central, which might support her stance. But the boyfriend's reaction shows he felt excluded, which is valid because major life decisions usually require both partners to be involved.\n\nBut the author did eventually share the decision with her boyfriend, and he was okay with it. The question is whether she was wrong to involve her family first. Depending on cultural norms and the specific relationship dynamics, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. However, in many cases, it's expected that both partners make such decisions together. The fact that she waited to discuss it with her family before informing him could be seen as not being fully transparent from the start, hence why the boyfriend was annoyed.\n\nOn the other hand, her reasoning about consulting her family, especially since they're mothers, might be seen as seeking support, which is natural. The key point is that she did inform her boyfriend eventually, and he was okay with the decision. The conflict arises from the timing and not involving him upfront, which might be a breach of trust or partnership.\n\nSo, considering all factors, there's a balance between the woman's autonomy and the partner's expectation of shared decision-making. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's a valid argument for the boyfriend's perspective. However, since the question is about the author's responsibility, and she did involve her partner eventually, maybe the answer is B. Alternatively, if the expectation in the relationship is always to consult each other first, then A. But since the scenario doesn't specify prior agreements, I think the general consensus would be that she's not in the wrong (B).\n"
