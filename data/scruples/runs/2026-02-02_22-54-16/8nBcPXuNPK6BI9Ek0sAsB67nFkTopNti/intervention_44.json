After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their mother and sister about their pregnancy before their boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author found out they're pregnant and immediately told their mom and sister. They took a few days to think things over, discussing it with their family. Then they decided to keep the baby and told their boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have made the decision together since it's their child.\n\nThe author argues that it's their choice and they don't feel wrong for confiding in their family, especially since their mom and sister are mothers themselves. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. \n\nSo, the key points here are communication and decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend feels left out of the decision-making process, which is valid because major life decisions typically involve mutual discussion. However, the author might have had valid reasons for initially consulting their family first, perhaps to process the information and seek support before sharing it with their partner.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should ideally be involved in big decisions like this. But the author's actions might be seen as reasonable if they felt the need to discuss with their family first. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable, but that doesn't automatically make the author wrong. It's more about communication styles and expectations. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they had their reasons and eventually informed the boyfriend. However, the situation highlights a need for better communication between the couple. It's a gray area, but since the author made a choice that they believe is right and didn't intentionally exclude the boyfriend, the answer is likely B.\n"
