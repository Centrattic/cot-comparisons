After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before informing her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant, took a few days to process, and discussed it with her family first. Then she told her boyfriend, who was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together. The author argues that she consulted her family since they're mothers and it's her choice.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are communication and shared decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend feels left out, which is valid because major life decisions usually involve both partners. However, the author had her reasons for involving her family first, especially since they have experience as mothers.\n\nBut wait, even though it's her body, the relationship aspect is important. The boyfriend was hurt that she didn't include him initially. The author did eventually tell him and they're moving forward. Both sides have valid perspectives. The boyfriend's reaction is about partnership, while the author prioritized family support.\n\nI think the answer depends on how the situation is viewed. The author isn't necessarily wrong for seeking family advice, but maybe she should have considered her partner's feelings more. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the decision to keep the baby was mutual after she told him, and the initial step was to seek family input, which is common for some people, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a balance here. The boyfriend's feelings are important too. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the question is about being in the wrong. I don't see a clear violation of right or wrong, more of a communication issue. So the answer is B.\n"
