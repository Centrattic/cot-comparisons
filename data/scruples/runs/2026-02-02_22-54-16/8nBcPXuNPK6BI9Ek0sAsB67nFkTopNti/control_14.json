After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author found out she's pregnant, did two tests, then called her mom and sister. She took a few days to think and discuss with her family before telling her boyfriend. When she did tell him, he was okay but annoyed that she informed her family first and decided to keep the baby without him. He felt they should have decided together since it's their child.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she needed time to process, used her family (who are mothers themselves) as a support system, and now feels she's made the right choice. She acknowledges his point but doesn't feel wrong.\n\nTo determine if she's in the wrong, I need to consider relationship dynamics. In a committed relationship, major decisions involving both partners, like having a child, should ideally be made together. However, the author might have felt overwhelmed and needed support. Her family being mothers could have provided valuable insight. \n\nBut, by not including her boyfriend from the start, she might have made him feel excluded. Even if she discussed with her family, involving him later might have been stressful for him. The key is whether both partners felt involved in the decision. The author decided to keep the child without him, which he found upsetting. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had the right to seek support from her family. There's no indication she lied or hid it intentionally; she just needed time. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions were driven by seeking support and processing the news. \n\nSo, it's a balance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she had good intentions, but she could have communicated better with her boyfriend earlier. However, since she did involve him eventually and he was okay with the decision, maybe there's no clear wrongdoing. The answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication. But maybe A (Yes) if the decision should have been joint from the start. Hmm. \n\nWait, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's annoyance is valid, but does that make her wrong? If the couple was supposed to make such a big decision together, then maybe she should have included him first. However, she might not have known how he'd react and needed time. But ideally, both partners should be involved in major life decisions affecting both. So, maybe A is the answer here. But I'm a bit torn. The answer is A or B?\n"
