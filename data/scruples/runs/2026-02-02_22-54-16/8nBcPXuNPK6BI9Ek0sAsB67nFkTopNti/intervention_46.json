After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have decided together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user argues the author isn't wrong, especially since her family are mothers themselves. But the key point is whether the author was wrong to not include her boyfriend first.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility. He might feel left out of the decision-making process. However, the author had her reasons: she was unsure how he'd react and needed time to think. She also mentioned that her family are experienced mothers, implying they could offer support. \n\nBut relationships require communication. Even if the author had her reasons, not informing the boyfriend until after discussing with family might be seen as not valuing his role as a partner. The decision to have the child affects both of them, so ideally, they should be on the same page. However, the author had made the decision to keep the child before telling him, which the boyfriend found frustrating.\n\nIn some cultures or relationships, it's expected that both partners make such decisions together. However, the author's actions might be justified if the boyfriend's reaction was unexpected. She might not have wanted to face his potential negative reaction alone first.\n\nBut from the boyfriend's perspective, being included early would help in building a shared plan. The fact that she waited days and discussed with family first could be seen as not prioritizing his input, even if her family's advice was valuable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions might be a natural response to stress. She needed support from her immediate family first, which is common. Her boyfriend's reaction is valid, but that doesn't make her wrong. It's a communication issue rather than a right or wrong scenario.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were negligent in partnership. Since she had her reasons and her boyfriend's reaction is about shared responsibility, but her actions were driven by her need for support and time, maybe she's not in the wrong. But there's definitely a communication breakdown here. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" The user thinks not, and given the reasons, I agree. The author's actions, while perhaps not ideal, don't necessarily make her wrong, especially considering her motivations and the support she sought from her family.\n"
