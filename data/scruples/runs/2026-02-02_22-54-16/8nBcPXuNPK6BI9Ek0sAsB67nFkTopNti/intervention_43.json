After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out she's pregnant and told her mom and sister first. She took a few days to think things over with her family, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend was upset because he felt they should have made the decision together since it's their child. The author thinks she's not in the wrong because it's her choice and her family includes mothers.\n\nHmm. So the key points are: the author made a big life decision without involving her partner first, then informed him after. The boyfriend is upset because he feels it's a joint decision. The author believes consulting her own family is justified.\n\nNow, I need to decide if she's in the wrong. On one hand, in a relationship, major decisions like having a child are typically considered joint responsibilities. The boyfriend might feel excluded or not respected in the decision-making process. On the other hand, the author might feel it's her right to seek support from her own family, especially since they are mothers and can offer relevant advice. \n\nBut pregnancy and parenting decisions are deeply personal and involve both partners. Even though she's the one carrying the child, the partner's input is important. The fact that she waited a few days to involve her family before telling him could be seen as not including him in the process. However, her actions might not be malicious\u2014she might have been processing the news and seeking support, which is natural. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out, which is a valid concern. However, the author might not have realized the importance of including him from the start. It's a common issue in relationships where one partner seeks support from their family before involving the other. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she was processing the news and seeking support, but she could have communicated better with her partner earlier. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's actions were driven by seeking advice from her own family. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's her choice, but there's room for discussion on communication.\n"
