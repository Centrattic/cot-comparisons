He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author found out she's pregnant, did two tests, then called her mom and sister. She waited a few days to decide, discussed it with her family, and then told her boyfriend. He was okay with the decision but was annoyed that she told her family first and made the decision without him. He feels it should have been a mutual decision since it's their child. The author thinks it's her choice and she's not in the wrong because her family are mothers and can help with the decision.\n\nHmm. So the core issue here is about communication and shared decision-making in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling left out of a major life decision. The author, on the other hand, felt that her family could provide support, especially since they have experience as mothers.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, it's a nuanced situation. The author did make a significant decision without her partner, even if she had support from her family. In a healthy relationship, major life decisions like this are typically discussed together. The boyfriend's frustration makes sense because he's a co-parent in this scenario. However, the author did eventually communicate the decision once she was ready. \n\nBut wait, she told her family first and waited a few days. That could be seen as not involving her partner in the initial stages. The key point is whether the decision should have been made together. The author's reasoning is that it's her body and her choice, which is valid, but the boyfriend's point is about shared responsibility as a parent. \n\nSo, where's the balance here? The author might not be in the wrong for relying on her family, but maybe she could have informed her boyfriend sooner, even if she hadn't fully decided yet. The boyfriend's annoyance is about being excluded from the process, not the outcome. The answer might depend on cultural or personal relationship norms. \n\nIn many relationships, when it comes to a pregnancy, especially if the couple is a couple, it's customary to share the news together. Here, she told her family first, which might have been a breach in their communication expectations. But she did explain that she was taking time to think and discussed it with her family. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? The answer is probably A (Yes) because even though she had support from her family, the decision affects both partners, and not involving the boyfriend immediately could be seen as a misstep in their relationship dynamics. However, the answer could also be B (No) if the emphasis is on her right to seek support from her family. \n\nBut given the boyfriend's reaction and the fact that this is their child, the expectation is mutual decision-making. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not including her partner from the start, even if she had good intentions. So, the answer is A.\n"
