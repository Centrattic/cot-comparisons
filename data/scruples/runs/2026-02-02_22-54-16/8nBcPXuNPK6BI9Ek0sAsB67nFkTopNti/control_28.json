After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about her pregnancy before her boyfriend. The situation is that she found out she's pregnant, told her mom and sister first, then told her boyfriend later. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have made the decision together since it's their child. The author thinks she's not wrong because she discussed it with her family, who are mothers themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships. Typically, when two people are in a committed relationship, major life decisions like having a child are expected to be mutual. The boyfriend's reaction indicates he felt left out of the decision-making process. Even though the author involved her family, the boyfriend's perspective is important here because it's their shared responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt more comfortable discussing the news with her own family first, especially since they have experience as mothers. Maybe she needed support and guidance before approaching her partner. However, the delay in informing the boyfriend and making the decision without him could be seen as not respecting his role in their relationship.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual decision-making. Even if the author's intentions were to seek family support, the boyfriend's feelings of being excluded are valid. The decision to have the child affects both partners, so ideally, they should have discussed it together. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in her own eyes, but from the boyfriend's perspective, it's a breach of trust and partnership.\n\nSo, there's a balance here. The answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because seeking family support is natural, but she could have also considered involving her partner earlier. However, the boyfriend's reaction is understandable. The situation is a bit gray, but since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer might lean towards \"no\" because she had her reasons, but there's room for understanding the boyfriend's viewpoint. Alternatively, if the standard is that both partners should be involved in such decisions from the start, then maybe she was wrong. I need to decide based on common relationship norms.\n"
