After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author found out she was pregnant, took two tests, then called her mom and sister. She wasn't sure how her boyfriend would react, so she took a few days to think and discuss with her family. Then she decided to keep the baby. When she told her boyfriend, he was okay with the pregnancy but annoyed that she told her family first and made the decision without him. He felt it was their child, so they should have decided together.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's actions versus her boyfriend's expectations. On one hand, she might feel that as the one who's pregnant, it's her body and her decision, especially since she wasn't sure about how he'd react. Her mom and sister are mothers themselves, so she might have felt they could give good advice. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that since it's a shared responsibility, decisions should be made together. \n\nI need to think about common perspectives on this. Some people might argue that in a relationship, major life decisions like this should be mutual. Others might say that in an emergency or uncertain situation, a woman has the right to decide what's best for herself first. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend didn't seem overly upset about the pregnancy itself, just the order and involvement in the decision. The author did involve her family, which could be seen as seeking support, which is understandable. However, not involving her partner first might be a point of contention. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. It's a bit subjective. Culturally, some might side with the boyfriend, expecting joint decisions. Others might support the author's right to prioritize her own needs and family support. The fact that she did eventually tell her boyfriend and they are moving forward might matter too. \n\nI think the answer depends on the relationship's dynamics. If the boyfriend is a partner in the sense of shared decision-making, then not including him might be seen as wrong. But if the author felt the need to secure support and make a decision for herself first, that's also valid. The answer isn't clear-cut, but the question is asking for a choice between A or B. \n\nGiven that the author didn't hide the pregnancy from her boyfriend but told her family first, and considering that she made a decision for herself which is her right, maybe she's not in the wrong. But others might see it as a partnership issue. Hmm.\n"
