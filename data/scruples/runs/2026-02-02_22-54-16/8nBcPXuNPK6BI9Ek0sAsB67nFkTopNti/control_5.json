After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her mother and sister about her pregnancy before informing her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks they should have decided together.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman found out she's pregnant and immediately told her family. She took a few days to think things over, discussing it with her family, and then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he wasn't part of the initial decision-making process. He feels it's their child, so he expected to be involved from the start.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations in a relationship regarding major life decisions. In many relationships, both partners are expected to be informed and involved in significant decisions like having a child. By telling her family first, the author might have overlooked her partner's feelings or the mutual expectation of shared decision-making. However, she might argue that her family, being mothers themselves, could provide support and advice, which is valid.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded. Even if she had good intentions, not including him in the initial discussions could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. The question is whether her actions were wrong. Culturally, there's often an expectation that both partners should be informed at the same time about such news. However, there's also the aspect of personal autonomy\u2014the decision is hers to make, but communication with the partner is crucial.\n\nThe author's justification is that she needed time to process and had family support. But the timing and the fact that she waited to tell her boyfriend after already discussing with her family might have contributed to his feeling of being left out. It's a balance between personal agency and relational partnership.\n\nSo, whether she's in the wrong depends on the relationship's norms. If the couple had an understanding that they would share such news together, then she might be in the wrong. But if there was no prior agreement, her actions might be seen as justified. Since the boyfriend was upset, it suggests that there was an expectation of mutual decision-making. Therefore, while her intentions might be understandable, the execution might have been flawed. The answer might lean towards her being in the wrong, but there's nuance here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Given the boyfriend's perspective, AITA often sides with the partner in such cases, but I need to make sure. The author's defense is that she made the decision, but the boyfriend's valid feelings of exclusion are important. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
