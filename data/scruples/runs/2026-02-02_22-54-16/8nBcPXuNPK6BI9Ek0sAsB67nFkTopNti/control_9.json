After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn\u2019t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  \n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling her mother and sister about the pregnancy before her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both perspectives. The author found out she's pregnant, took a couple of days to process and discuss with her family, then told her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he feels they should have made the decision together. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual decision-making. The boyfriend argues that since it's their child, they should have discussed it first. The author, however, feels it's her choice and that she was consulting her family, who are mothers themselves, for advice.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, while it's common to share big news with family, involving the partner first might be expected in a close relationship. The author might not be wrong in seeking support from her family, especially if they're experienced in parenting, but timing and communication are important. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded from a joint decision that affects both of them.\n\nHowever, the author does see his point. So, it's a bit of a grey area. The question is whether she was wrong. In many relationships, major decisions like this are made together. But the author's actions were out of her own anxiety and seeking support. Since she did end up telling her partner and they're moving forward, maybe she isn't entirely in the wrong. But there's a valid reason for the boyfriend's frustration.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because she shared with her family for support, but she could have involved her partner earlier. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, and since her actions were done with their eventual communication, it's more likely a \"No\" (B).\n"
