How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others in real life.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was clearly their name. They browsed the history but didn't find anything controversial. Later, they told other friends about it during a bar trivia night and showed the account. The friend got upset, claiming it violated a \"sacred Reddit code,\" but the author argues that using an almost-real name in a public forum makes it public information.\n\nNow, considering privacy. Even if the username is obvious, Reddit is often used as an anonymous platform. People might expect some level of privacy. The author took information from a public space and shared it in person, which could be a breach of trust. But the friend's username was public, so maybe the author isn't wrong.\n\nBut wait, just because something is public doesn't mean it's okay to share it. The friend might have wanted to keep their online presence separate from real life. The author's action could be seen as exposing someone without consent, even if the info was public. However, the friend's username was transparent, so the author might not be wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's reaction might be overblown. The author didn't share anything harmful, just the account. But the key point is consent. The friend didn't give permission for others to see their account. So even if the info is public, sharing it without consent could be considered wrong.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the username is public and the content isn't private, maybe the author isn't at fault. However, the act of exposing it might still be a privacy issue. The friend's intention to maintain an online identity separate from real life is important here. The author might have crossed a line by sharing it, even if the info was public. So, the answer could be A (Yes), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, if the info was public, maybe B (No). It's tricky. I think the answer hinges on whether the friend intended to keep their Reddit identity private despite public info. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't know the friend wanted privacy. But if the friend expected privacy, the author is in the wrong. The story says the username was obvious, so maybe the friend didn't intend privacy. Hmm.\n"
