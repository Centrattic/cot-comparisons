How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The person found their friend's Reddit account because the friend used a username that was almost their real name. They browsed the friend's history, then later told their friends about it and showed them the account. The friend was upset, feeling it was a breach of privacy, while the author thinks it's not a big deal because the friend used an obvious username.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy and consent. The friend didn't want his Reddit account known by others, and the author shared it without permission. Even if the username was guessable, does that mean it's okay to expose it? Maybe not. The friend's intention was probably to keep their online presence separate from their real life, even if the username wasn't a perfect disguise. The author might argue that the friend was careless with their identity, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action of sharing it without consent.\n\nAlso, the \"secret code\" mentioned by the friend about not exposing Reddit accounts is a common sentiment in online communities. People often use Reddit to post anonymously or semi-anonymously, and revealing someone's identity can feel like a violation of that trust. The author's action might have crossed a line, even if the content wasn't harmful.\n\nThen there's the reaction of the friends. If they laughed at the friend for being upset, that could indicate that the social group doesn't take online privacy seriously, but that doesn't make it right. The author's friends might not see it as a big deal, but the friend who was exposed did. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the friend's reaction.\n\nAnother angle is intent. The author didn't post anything harmful, just shared the account. But even that can lead to embarrassment or discomfort for the friend. The line between a joke and a privacy violation can be thin. The author might have thought it was harmless, but the fact that the friend was upset is a red flag.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' privacy is generally a good rule. Even if someone is not hiding something bad, their right to control who knows about their online presence matters. The author's action might not be malicious, but it disregards the friend's possible desire for privacy. So even if the friend made it easy to find, the act of exposing it without consent could be wrong.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they violated the friend's privacy by sharing their Reddit account without permission, regardless of how obvious the username was.\n"
