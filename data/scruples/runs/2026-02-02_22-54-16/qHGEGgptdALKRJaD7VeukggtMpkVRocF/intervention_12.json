How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. Let me start by breaking down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author was on a local subreddit and noticed a friend's Reddit account because the username was clearly theirs (first name plus first three letters of the last name). The author checked the friend's history but didn't find anything controversial. Then, when they met the friend and other friends at a bar, they brought up the Reddit account during trivia night, showing it to the group. The friend got upset about this, claiming it's a breach of some \"sacred Reddit code,\" while the author and the other friends didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider the key points here. \n\nReddit users often use pseudonyms, and there's a general understanding of online privacy. Even if the username is obvious, sharing someone's online account publicly without their consent might be a privacy issue. The author argues that the account wasn't hiding anything bad and that the friend's username was too obvious. But the friend was upset, which suggests that their privacy was breached in their eyes.\n\nThe author's defense is that the username was easy to guess and that the content wasn't harmful. However, the action of exposing the account without the friend's permission could be seen as violating their trust. Even if the information isn't damaging, sharing someone's online identity in a public setting (like a bar with friends) might be crossing a line. \n\nReddit's culture does emphasize anonymity and not sharing real-world identities, but the friend's username wasn't exactly anonymous\u2014it was based on their real name. Still, the act of revealing it in person might be considered a breach of that implicit trust. The author might have thought it harmless, but the friend felt violated. The other friends might mock the friend for being \"triggered,\" but that doesn't negate the fact that the author shared private information without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't know the username was their friend's until seeing the post. They didn't set out to expose them but rather stumbled upon it. However, once they found out, they decided to share it. The key here is consent. Did the friend expect their Reddit account to remain private? If they used personal identifying info in their username, maybe they didn't consider it private, but that's a common misconception. People might not realize how easy it is for others to connect online identities to real life, especially in small communities.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing someone's online account without permission, even if it's a friend, can be considered a breach of privacy. The friend's reaction, while maybe over the top to some, is a valid response to personal boundaries being crossed. The author's justification that the account wasn't embarrassing or harmful doesn't fully address the friend's right to privacy. Even if the content is benign, the act of exposing it without consent is a privacy issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author probably is in the wrong because they shared their friend's online identity without permission, which is a privacy violation, regardless of the content's nature. The friend's username being obvious doesn't negate the breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
