How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. I need to figure out the answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author found their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious with the friend's first name and part of the last name. The author then told other friends about it during a trivia night and showed them the account. The friend was upset about this, feeling it violated some \"sacred Reddit code.\" \n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author respect the friend's privacy? Reddit is an online platform, but the friend might have expected a certain level of anonymity. Even if the account wasn't doing anything harmful, exposing someone's online identity without consent could be a breach of trust. \n\nThe friend used a username that's close to their real name, which might have been a mistake, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to expose it. Privacy expectations can be subjective. The author might not have intended harm, but the friend felt it was a big deal. \n\nAlso, the author's justification was that the friend's username gave away their identity. But just because someone is careless with their online identity doesn't mean others have the right to expose it. There's a difference between being careless and being invaded. \n\nThe other friends laughed at the friend for getting upset, which might indicate that the author's actions were seen as a prank, but the main issue is about consent and privacy. The author didn't ask the friend if it was okay to share the account details. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author didn't seek permission and shared personal information without the friend's consent. Even if the information was publicly accessible, the act of revealing it in person could be considered a violation of privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
