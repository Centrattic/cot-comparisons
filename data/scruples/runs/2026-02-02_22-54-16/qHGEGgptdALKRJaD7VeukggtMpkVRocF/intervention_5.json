How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the friend's Reddit username was pretty obvious because of the small community and the username structure. The author found the account, told others about it, and showed it to them in person. The friend got upset, claiming it's a \"sacred Reddit code\" not to reveal accounts. The author's friends laughed at the friend for being triggered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Even if the username was guessable, the friend might have expected some level of anonymity. By sharing it, the author might have violated that expectation. But the friend used a username that's almost their real name, which makes me think maybe they weren't too concerned about privacy. However, just because it's guessable doesn't mean the friend wanted others to know. The author could argue it's not their fault for using an identifiable username. \n\nThen there's the fact that the author didn't share anything private, just the account. The friend got mad, but others didn't see a problem. The author didn't post it online or do anything harmful except showing it in person. Maybe in a small community, anonymity is hard, but does that mean others can just expose it? The user (author) thinks they're not in the wrong, but maybe they should consider the friend's feelings. \n\nReddit users often keep their accounts private, even if they use real names. The idea of a \"sacred code\" might not be real, but the friend felt their privacy was breached. So, even if the username was obvious, the act of revealing it without consent could be seen as a breach. The author might be in the wrong because they took a friend's privacy and shared it, even if it was guessable. However, the username being so obvious complicates things. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn conclusion, it's tricky. The author might not be entirely in the wrong due to the username's obviousness, but they could have respected the friend's privacy more. The answer might depend on the context of the friendship and expectations of privacy. Since the friend was upset, maybe the author should have asked first. So leaning towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) but there's a case for B too. However, the main point is whether the action was wrong. Since the author shared without consent, even if the info was guessable, it's a breach of trust. So answer A.\n"
