How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account. The situation is that the friend used a username that was almost his real name, and the author found out his account. Then, at a bar, the author told others and showed them the account. The friend was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Even if the username was obvious, the friend might have wanted to keep their online activity separate from their real life. Sharing someone's online account without consent can be a privacy issue. The fact that the friend got \"irate\" suggests he felt his privacy was violated.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the friend uses Reddit for light-hearted posts, but that doesn't mean he's okay with his account being exposed. The argument that the username was obvious doesn't negate the breach of trust. The author didn't ask for permission before sharing the account with others, which is a key point here.\n\nThe author might think it's not a big deal because they don't take Reddit seriously, but others might have different boundaries. The friend's reaction indicates that he did care. The \"sacred Reddit code\" isn't real, but the principle of respecting someone's privacy online is important. \n\nEven though the content wasn't harmful, the act of exposing someone's account without consent is a violation of their privacy. The author should have respected the friend's possible desire to keep his online presence private. So, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
