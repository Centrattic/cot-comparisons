How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username by recognizing the name pattern in a local subreddit. Then, when talking with mutual friends, the author shared the username and showed it to them. The friend got upset, thinking it's a breach of some Reddit \"code,\" but the author argues that the friend shouldn't have used such an obvious username in a small community.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is about privacy and consent. The friend didn't want his Reddit account to be known by others, maybe because he thought it was private. The author, however, found it by accident and shared it, thinking it wasn't a big deal. But the friend felt his privacy was invaded.\n\nReddit is an online platform, and people often use pseudonyms. The friend's choice of username made it possible for someone to guess his identity, especially in a small community. The author didn't actively go out to find the account but recognized it through context. However, even if the username was guessable, sharing it without the friend's consent could be seen as a privacy violation.\n\nThe author claims they didn't think it was a big deal because the friend's posts weren't harmful. But the friend's reaction shows that he did mind. Even if the username was obvious, the act of exposing it to others could be considered a breach of trust, especially among friends. The other friends making fun of him might have added to the tension, but the main question is about the author's action.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the friend was negligent in choosing a username that gave away his identity. However, in terms of ethics, the author had a responsibility to respect the friend's privacy. Even if the information was public, sharing it without permission can be problematic. The friend's discomfort indicates that the author overstepped, regardless of the reasonableness of the username choice.\n\nSo, considering the balance between the friend's privacy and the author's actions, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's privacy, even if the information was publicly available. The key is the lack of consent. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
