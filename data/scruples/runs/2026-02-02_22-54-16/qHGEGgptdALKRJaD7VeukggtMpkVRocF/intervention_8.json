How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The author found out their friend's Reddit username because it was obvious, given the small community and the username format. They then told their friends about it, showed the account, and the friend got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend used a username that was almost their real name, which might be part of the issue. The author didn't do anything malicious, just shared the account name. But is sharing someone's online identity without permission a breach of privacy?\n\nReddit users typically use pseudonyms, and there's an unspoken rule not to reveal account names. The friend might feel that their online presence is private, even if the username isn't a perfect match. The author might argue that the friend didn't keep his identity secret enough, but that doesn't mean it's okay to expose it.\n\nAlso, the friend got \"somewhat irate,\" which suggests he felt violated. Even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of exposing the account could be seen as a privacy breach. The author's action might be careless, even if they didn't think it was a big deal. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's username made it easy to identify him, which could imply he didn't take full precautions. But that doesn't justify the author's actions. The author should have respected his friend's privacy regardless of the username choice.\n\nSo, even though the friend might have contributed to the situation by using a recognizable username, the author is still in the wrong for sharing it without consent. The line between a privacy breach and a harmless joke can be thin, but the friend's reaction indicates it wasn't harmless to him. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
