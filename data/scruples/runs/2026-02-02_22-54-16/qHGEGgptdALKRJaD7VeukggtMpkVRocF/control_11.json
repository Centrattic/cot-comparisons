How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author found out that their friend was using a Reddit account with an obvious username. They noticed it because the friend's name was almost entirely there. The author then told their other friends about this and showed them the account. The friend got upset, thinking it's a big deal, while the author and others thought it wasn't a problem because there was nothing embarrassing. The friend claims there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" about keeping accounts secret, but the author is confused and says they didn't do anything bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author used their own initiative to find out their friend's Reddit account, which wasn't exactly anonymous. Then, they shared that information with others. The issue is whether this was a breach of privacy or trust.\n\nReddit does have a policy against doxxing, which is sharing someone's private information without consent. But in this case, the friend's username was already mostly their real name. So maybe the username was public, but the act of exposing it to others in real life might still be problematic. The friend might have used the platform expecting anonymity, even if the username was close to their real name. The author's defense is that the username was obvious, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to share it. The friend's privacy might have been violated, even if the information wasn't hidden. \n\nAlso, the author's actions could be seen as respecting the friend's boundaries or not. Even if the friend made their username somewhat identifiable, they might not have wanted others to know it's them. The author's friends might have made light of the situation, but the friend felt it was a serious issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't know the friend's username was secret. They just noticed it and shared it. But even if the information was public, sharing it in real life without permission could be a breach of trust. The friend's reaction might be about the principle of not having their online identity exposed to others without consent. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be considered a violation of the friend's privacy, even if the username wasn't entirely secret. The friend's expectation of privacy on Reddit might not be met by the author's actions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they shared someone's online identity without their consent, regardless of how obvious the username was. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
