How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the friend used a username that was obviously their real name (first name plus first three letters of the last name) on a local subreddit. The author discovered this, browsed the friend's history, and later told others about it at a bar. The friend is upset, claiming it's a violation of some \"Reddit code,\" but the author argues that using a username that's almost their real name in a small community subreddit makes it obvious.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the friend's choice of username and the expectation of privacy. If the friend used a username that clearly identifies them, especially in a small community, they might have a lower expectation of privacy. The author didn't do anything malicious; they just shared the account details with mutual friends. The friend's reaction might be based on the fact that they didn't want their online presence known, but their username choice made that possible.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the username is obvious, does that mean it's acceptable to expose it? The author didn't ask for permission before sharing. While the friend's username was a bad choice, the act of exposing it could still be seen as a breach of trust, even if unintentional. The author might argue they were just pointing out the obvious, but others might see it as invading privacy.\n\nReddit users often use pseudonyms for anonymity, so there's an expectation that their online identity isn't tied to their real life. The friend might have violated that by using a real-sounding username, but the author's action of sharing it could still be problematic. However, considering the context\u2014sharing it with friends in a casual setting and nothing harmful posted\u2014maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility could lie with the friend for choosing a non-anonymous username.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the friend's username choice negates their expectation of privacy. If the username was so obvious, then the author isn't wrong for pointing it out. Also, the fact that the friend's posts weren't embarrassing or harmful might support the author's side. But there's still an ethical consideration about sharing someone's online identity without consent, regardless of the username's transparency. However, in this case, the username itself was a public clue, so maybe the author's action isn't wrong.\n"
