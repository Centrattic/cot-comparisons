How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author found out their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious\u2014using the first name and first three letters of the last name. They thought it was funny and later told other friends, showing them the account. The friend got upset, claiming it's a \"sacred Reddit code\" not to expose accounts in real life. The author argues that the friend shouldn't have used a username that's so easily identifiable in a small community.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy and expectations. The friend probably expected anonymity on Reddit, using a username that's a bit unique but maybe not secretive. The author found it out accidentally and shared it, thinking it wasn't a big deal. The friend felt violated because their online identity was exposed without consent.\n\nNow, considering Reddit's norms, there's a culture of pseudonymity. Users choose usernames and may expect a certain level of privacy, even if their activity is mundane. The friend might have wanted to keep their Reddit presence separate from real life. The author, on the other hand, didn't see an issue because the username gave it away, and they didn't think the content was embarrassing.\n\nBut the fact that the friend was upset and called it a \"sacred code\" suggests that violating this boundary is a problem. Even if the content isn't harmful, the act of exposing someone's online identity without their permission can be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. The author might not have intended malice, but the line between a joke and a privacy violation can be thin. \n\nAlso, the author used their own judgment about what's appropriate, but others might have different boundaries. Since the friend was genuinely upset, the author's action, though maybe not malicious, did cause distress. So, even if the author thought it was harmless, the impact matters. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, intent is part of it, but the effect is also important. The author might be in the wrong if exposing the account was done without consent and caused harm to the friend's privacy. The fact that the friend was \"triggered\" and the buddies made fun of him indicates that the action crossed a social boundary.\n\nTherefore, while the author might not have seen it as a big deal, the friend's reaction shows that the action was a breach of privacy. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
