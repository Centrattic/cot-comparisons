How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to their mutual friends.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found their friend's Reddit account because the friend used an obvious username in a small community. The author then told their friends about it during a trivia night, showing them the account. The friend was upset about this, feeling it violated some Reddit \"code,\" while the author and others thought it wasn't a big deal.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether exposing the account was a breach of privacy or trust. The friend used a username that's almost their real name in a local subreddit, which might suggest they weren't expecting privacy. The author argues that since the username was obvious, there's no privacy expectation. But does that make it okay to share it?\n\nReddit users often have pseudonyms, but they might still expect a level of anonymity. The friend's reaction implies they valued their Reddit activity as private, even if their username was revealing. The author's action could be seen as a breach of that assumed privacy. Even if the content wasn't harmful, sharing someone's online identity without consent might infringe on their privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the username was guessable, and the subreddit is local, so maybe the friend didn't intend it to be private. However, just because something is guessable doesn't mean it's acceptable to expose it. People might not consider the consequences of using a semi-transparent username. The author's action led to the friend feeling upset, which indicates that the boundary was crossed.\n\nSo, even though the author might not have malicious intent, exposing someone's online account without their consent can be a privacy issue. The key point is whether the friend's username choices negated their expectation of privacy. But generally, sharing someone's online identity without permission is a breach of trust, regardless of how obvious it was. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
