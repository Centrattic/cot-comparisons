How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. The situation is that the author discovered their friend's Reddit account, which was easy to identify because the username used their first name and part of the last name. The author then told other friends about it during a trivia night, and the friend got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend's username was pretty obvious, almost their full name. The author didn't do anything malicious, just shared the account. The friend felt exposed, even though the content wasn't bad. The author argues that the friend shouldn't have used an identifiable username in a local subreddit. \n\nNow, the main issue is privacy. Even if the account is easy to guess, sharing someone's online account without their consent could be a breach of privacy. The friend's reaction might be based on the violation of their expectation of privacy. Even though the content wasn't harmful, the act of exposing the account without permission could be seen as a trust issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't hide the username. The argument is that if the username is so obvious, maybe the friend didn't have high expectations of privacy. However, Reddit is an online platform where users might expect some anonymity, even if they use a semi-real name. The friend might not have considered that others could link the account to them in real life. \n\nThe author's friends made fun of the upset friend, which might have contributed to the tension. But the core question is whether the author did something wrong. In terms of social norms, revealing someone's online identity without their consent can be seen as crossing a line. Even if the username was easy to guess, sharing it with others could be a violation of their privacy. \n\nThe author might not think it's a big deal, but the friend did. The fact that the friend felt \"triggered\" suggests that the author's actions had a negative impact. The argument that the friend shouldn't have used an identifiable username might not fully absolve the author. It's possible that the author should have respected the friend's privacy by not sharing the account details, even if it was easy to find. \n\nSo, considering these points, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they shared their friend's account without permission, which breaches privacy, regardless of how obvious the username was.\n"
