How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found out their friend's Reddit username by recognizing the name pattern in a local subreddit. They browsed the friend's history but didn't find anything major. Then, later, they told other friends about it and showed the account during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset, feeling that Reddit's privacy was violated. The author thinks it's not a big deal because the friend used an identifiable username and didn't post anything too bad.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about privacy and consent. The friend probably expected some level of anonymity on Reddit, even if the username was obvious. By exposing the account, the author breached that privacy, even if it was a small transgression. The friend's reaction suggests that they valued their online privacy, which the author didn't consider. \n\nAlso, the author didn't ask for permission before sharing the account with others. Even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of revealing someone's online identity without their consent can be seen as a violation. The fact that it's a local community might make the friend feel more exposed, as people know each other in real life. \n\nThe author's defense is that the friend used an obvious username. But that doesn't necessarily mean the friend wanted it to be linked to their real identity. Maybe they wanted to keep their online presence separate, even if it was easy to guess the name. The sacred Reddit code the friend mentioned refers to the unspoken rule that usernames are pseudonyms and should stay private. \n\nThe author's actions led to the friend feeling uncomfortable, which is a sign that something was wrong. Even if others made fun of the friend, the main issue is about respecting boundaries. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't respect the friend's privacy by exposing the account without consent. The fact that they did it in a group setting amplifies the breach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
