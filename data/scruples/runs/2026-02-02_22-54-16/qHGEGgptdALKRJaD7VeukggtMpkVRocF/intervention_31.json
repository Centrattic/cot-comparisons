How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the situation carefully. The main points are:\n\n1. The author discovered their friend's Reddit account because the username was obviously the friend's first name plus the first three letters of the last name. The community is small, so it's easy to identify.\n2. The author didn't do anything malicious at first; they just noticed the account and looked at the history, then moved on.\n3. Later, in a social setting (trivia night at a bar), the author told the story to friends and showed the account. The friend got upset, feeling it was a breach of privacy, citing a \"sacred Reddit code.\" The author argues that the friend's Reddit activity wasn't anything bad and that using an identifiable username in a small community subreddit is a risk.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The key here is whether the author violated the friend's privacy. The friend used a username that's easily identifiable, which might imply they weren't concerned about anonymity. However, even if the username is obvious, does that mean others can freely share it?\n\nIn terms of privacy norms, even if someone uses an identifiable username, sharing their account with others without consent could still be a privacy violation. The author might argue that it's harmless because there's nothing bad posted, but the friend still felt violated. The friend's reaction suggests that they didn't want their online presence to be exposed in person, regardless of the content.\n\nAnother angle: intent. Was the author trying to embarrass the friend or was it just innocent sharing among friends? The post mentions that the friend's posts were not embarrassing, and the author didn't take Reddit seriously. But even so, sharing the account without permission could be seen as crossing a boundary. The friend's \"sacred Reddit code\" might be a real thing in their community\u2014users often expect their online personas to stay separate from their real lives unless they choose otherwise.\n\nThe author might think they're not wrong because the friend's username was obvious and the content wasn't bad. However, privacy is about respecting someone's wishes and boundaries, not just about the content. If the friend didn't want people to know about their Reddit account, even with an obvious username, the author should have respected that. The fact that the friend was upset indicates that their boundary was crossed.\n\nAlso, the author might have thought it was funny or harmless, but others might see it as a breach of trust. The friend's reaction was getting \"irate\" and feeling it was a big deal, so the author should consider that their action, while perhaps not malicious, still caused discomfort. Even if the content isn't harmful, exposing someone's online presence without consent can be a privacy issue.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the friend's username made their identity somewhat obvious, the act of sharing the account with others without permission was a privacy violation. The author didn't consider the friend's right to keep their Reddit activity separate from their real-life interactions, which the friend clearly valued. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
