How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The friend was using a username that's almost their real name, which the author figured out. The author then told their friends about it and showed them the account. The friend got upset about it, saying there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" against exposing accounts.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. Even if the username is almost their real name, sharing that information without consent could be a privacy violation. The author might argue that the friend wasn't exactly hiding their identity, but that doesn't mean others would agree. The fact that the friend felt \"irate\" suggests that they felt their privacy was invaded. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as a breach of trust, even if they didn't think it was a big deal. Friends might expect a certain level of privacy, especially online. The author's friends made fun of the friend for being triggered, but that doesn't negate the friend's feelings. \n\nAlso, the idea of a \"sacred Reddit code\" might be a stretch, but many people do use Reddit to maintain an online persona separate from their real lives, even if their identity is somewhat obvious. Exposing that could be hurtful or embarrassing, even if the content isn't bad. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the friend's choice of username made it easy to identify them, implying they weren't careful with their privacy. But that's a bit like saying someone shouldn't be upset if they leave their house unlocked. It's a matter of expectations and whether the author acted within those expectations. \n\nConsidering all this, the author likely overstepped by sharing their friend's account with others. Even if the content wasn't offensive, the act of exposing someone's online presence without their consent is a privacy issue. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
