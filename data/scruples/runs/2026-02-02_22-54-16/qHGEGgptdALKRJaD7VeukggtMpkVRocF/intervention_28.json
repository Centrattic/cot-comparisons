How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. The situation is a bit of a gray area, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend's Reddit account was using a username that's almost his real name. The author found it because the community is small and the username was obvious. Then, they showed the account to their other friends. The friend got upset, thinking it's a violation of Reddit's \"unspoken code,\" but the author didn't see it as a big deal because the content wasn't anything bad.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author didn't share private info, just the Reddit account. The friend's username itself gives away personal info. The author didn't do anything malicious. The friends made fun of the friend for being triggered, which suggests maybe the friend overreacted. \n\nBut wait, even if the username is public, sharing someone's account without their consent could be a privacy issue. Reddit users might expect some level of anonymity, even if their usernames are identifiable. The author's action might have breached that trust, even if the content wasn't harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, the account wasn't hidden; the author just recognized it from the username. The friend's choice of username might have contributed to the exposure. Also, the author didn't share any private messages or personal info, just the account itself. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about the intent to expose. If the author didn't mean harm, but the friend felt his privacy was violated, that's a problem. Even if the friend's username was obvious, showing it to others in real life might have been the issue. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the friend's privacy was compromised because his Reddit presence is private to him, even if the info was public, then the author might be at fault. But if the author didn't share anything beyond the public account, maybe not. \n\nI think the line is blurry here. The author might be in the right because they didn't expose anything private, but the friend's privacy expectations might have been violated. However, given that the username was public and the content wasn't harmful, maybe the author isn't wrong. But I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they shared someone's personal account without consent, even if it was public. The friend's privacy on Reddit is a personal choice, and the author disregarded that choice by exposing it.\n"
