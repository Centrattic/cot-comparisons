How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The friend got upset about it, but the author argues that the username was obvious and that they didn't do anything harmful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Even if the friend used a username that's easy to guess, sharing someone's online identity without their consent could be a privacy issue. The friend might have expected some level of anonymity, even if they used a real name. The author's action might have violated that expectation.\n\nThen there's the aspect of intent. The author didn't post anything embarrassing, just shared the account name. But even that can be seen as a breach of trust. Friends often have an unspoken agreement about respecting each other's privacy, especially online.\n\nThe friend's reaction also matters. They were upset, which suggests that the action crossed a line in their eyes. The author's justification that the username was obvious doesn't negate the fact that they shared it without permission. The small community aspect might mean people take privacy more seriously because it's easier for things to get back to someone.\n\nAlso, the \"sacred Reddit code\" the friend mentioned might be a real sentiment among users who value anonymity. Even if the author doesn't take Reddit seriously, others might, and respecting that is part of being a good friend.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they shared a friend's online identity without consent, even if the friend made it guessable. Privacy expectations and the impact on the friend's feelings are key here.\n"
