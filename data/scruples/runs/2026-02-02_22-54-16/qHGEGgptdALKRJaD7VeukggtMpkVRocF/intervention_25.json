How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was based on the friend's real name. The author then told their friends about it and showed them the account. The friend was upset, claiming it's against some Reddit \"code\" not to expose accounts in real life. The author argues that using a real name in a small community subreddit makes it obvious, and they didn't think it was a big deal since the content wasn't harmful.\n\nNow, I need to consider privacy aspects. Even if the username is a combination of real name and initials, it's still a private account. The friend might have expected anonymity, even if their username was a bit revealing. The author didn't ask for permission to share the account details. So, maybe the author violated the friend's privacy, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything malicious. They just shared what they found, and the content wasn't harmful. The friend's upset reaction is about privacy expectations, which might be valid. But in a small community, using a real name username could imply they're okay with some level of identification. However, that doesn't necessarily mean others can expose their account. The line between what's private and public is tricky here.\n\nReddit's terms of service usually prohibit doxxing or exposing personal info, but this is about sharing a username. If the friend used a public username, maybe they knew there was a risk. But the act of sharing the account with others could still be a privacy breach. The author didn't ask if it's okay to share, so even if the username is guessable, the exposure without consent is the issue. \n\nThe friend's reaction about a \"sacred code\" might be more about norms in Reddit communities where anonymity is valued. The author didn't respect that norm, even if the friend's username wasn't entirely anonymous. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's privacy expectations, regardless of the username choice.\n"
