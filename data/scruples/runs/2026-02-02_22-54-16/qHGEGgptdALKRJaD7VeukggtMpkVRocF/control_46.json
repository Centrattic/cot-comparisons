How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username because the friend used a name that was almost their real name in a small community. The author then told their friends about it and showed them the account. The friend got upset about being exposed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Reddit accounts are online, but people might expect some level of anonymity or at least not having their account linked to their real identity, especially if they used a username that's close to their real name. The friend might have chosen that username without considering that someone in real life could connect it, especially in a small community. But does that mean the author is justified in exposing it? Not necessarily. Even if the username is obvious, sharing someone's account without their consent can invade their privacy. The friend's reaction suggests they felt their privacy was breached, which is a valid concern.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they didn't think it was a big deal because the friend wasn't posting anything too bad. But the issue isn't about the content; it's about the act of revealing the account to others. The friend might have wanted to keep their online activity separate from their real-life interactions. Even if the username is guessable, the author took an active step to connect it and share it with friends. That could be seen as crossing a boundary, regardless of the content posted.\n\nThe friend's claim about a \"sacred Reddit code\" isn't an official rule, but it reflects a common understanding among Reddit users that they should keep their accounts private unless they choose to share them. By exposing it, the author disregarded that unspoken agreement. The fact that the author's friends found it funny and made fun of the friend might have added to the friend's discomfort, making the situation worse.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author had the choice to either keep the discovery to themselves or discuss it with the friend first. By deciding to show it to others without asking, they violated the friend's privacy. The friend's reaction, while maybe unexpected, is a valid response to having their online identity revealed without consent. So, even if the username was easy to guess, the act of sharing it without permission is where the author made the mistake. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
