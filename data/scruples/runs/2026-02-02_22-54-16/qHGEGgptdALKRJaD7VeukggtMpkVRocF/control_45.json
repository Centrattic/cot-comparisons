How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to their other friends. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found their friend's Reddit account because the friend used a username that was almost their real name in a small community. The author then told their friends about it and showed them the account. The friend was upset about this, feeling it violated some Reddit \"code,\" while the author and others didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy. The friend probably expected their Reddit activity to be private, even if their username was semi-public. By exposing their account to others, the author might have breached that privacy. The key points to consider are consent and intent. The author didn't ask the friend if it was okay to share their account details. Even if the friend's username was guessable, that doesn't mean they intended for their account to be known by others outside of Reddit.\n\nReddit users often use pseudonyms and might expect a certain level of anonymity. The friend's reaction suggests that they valued their online privacy, even in a local subreddit. The author's action of showing the account to friends could be seen as violating that trust, even if the content wasn't harmful. The author's justification\u2014that the friend's username gave it away\u2014doesn't negate the lack of consent. \n\nAlso, sharing someone's online account details without permission can be considered a breach of privacy, regardless of the platform. The fact that the others made fun of the friend for being \"triggered\" might indicate that the author didn't take the friend's privacy concerns seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the friend wasn't using a completely anonymous username, so there's some accountability there. However, expecting others to respect your privacy, even if you're using a semi-public identifier, is reasonable. The line between public and private can be blurry, but in this case, the friend's privacy was compromised. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't respect their friend's privacy by exposing their Reddit account without permission. Even if the information was publicly accessible in a way, sharing it with others without consent is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
