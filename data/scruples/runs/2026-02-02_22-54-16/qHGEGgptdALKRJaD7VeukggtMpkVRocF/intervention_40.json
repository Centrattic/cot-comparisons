How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out one of their friends uses Reddit with an obvious username and later told other friends about it, even showing them the account. The friend was upset, claiming a \"sacred Reddit code\" was broken, while the author and others didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that the friend's Reddit account was easy to identify because of the username, so exposing it wasn't a big deal. They also mention that the content wasn't anything bad\u2014just sports jokes. The friend, on the other hand, felt violated, as if there's an unspoken rule about keeping Reddit accounts private from real life.\n\nNow, the key points here are about privacy expectations. Reddit is a platform where users might use pseudonyms or usernames to maintain anonymity. Even if the username is obvious, the user might have still expected a certain level of separation between their online identity and real life. By exposing the account, the author potentially breached that user's privacy, even if the content wasn't harmful. \n\nThe author's friends didn't think it was a big deal, but that doesn't negate the friend's feelings. Privacy is subjective; what one person sees as a minor issue, another might see as a violation. The author might not have intended harm, but the act of sharing someone's online account without permission can be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nAlso, the \"sacred Reddit code\" the friend mentioned isn't an official rule, but it reflects a common understanding among Reddit users to keep their accounts private. Even if the username is guessable, the expectation is that others won't actively reveal that connection to others. So, the author's action, while maybe not malicious, could be seen as crossing a line by sharing the account publicly among friends.\n\nIn terms of accountability, it's about respecting others' boundaries. The friend might have not made their privacy expectations clear, but the act of exposing an online identity without consent is generally frowned upon. The author didn't ask for permission and shared it in a social setting, which could lead to discomfort for the friend. \n\nOn the flip side, the author didn't know the username was linked to the friend until they noticed it themselves. But once they realized, they had a choice to either respect the friend's privacy or not. By choosing to share it, they took an action that, regardless of intent, invaded the friend's privacy in the eyes of the friend. \n\nSo, while there's no malice, the action itself was a privacy violation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
