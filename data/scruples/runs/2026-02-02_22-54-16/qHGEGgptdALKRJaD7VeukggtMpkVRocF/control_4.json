How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others in person. The situation involves a friend who used a clearly identifiable username, which the author recognized and then shared during a trivia night.\n\nFirst, the friend's username was his first name and first three letters of his last name. In a small community, that's pretty obvious. The author found the account while looking at a post about someone moving to the area, so it's possible the friend's identity was already being discussed. But even so, the author took it upon themselves to share this with mutual friends without the friend's consent. \n\nThe friend got upset, claiming a \"sacred Reddit code\" about keeping accounts private. The author argues that the username was already a dead giveaway. However, even if the username is obvious, the friend might have expected some level of privacy. Reddit is an online space where people might use pseudonyms to separate their online personas from their real lives. By exposing the account, the author potentially invaded that privacy, even if the content wasn't harmful. \n\nThe other friends made fun of the friend, but that might be a separate issue. The key point is whether the author respected the friend's privacy. The friend felt the action was a breach, and the author didn't consider that before sharing. Even if the friend's username was easy to guess, it's about the intent and the respect for their boundaries. The author might not have malicious intent, but the act of revealing someone's online identity without permission can be seen as crossing a line. \n\nSo, while the username was a clue, the author's action of exposing it without asking could be considered a privacy violation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
