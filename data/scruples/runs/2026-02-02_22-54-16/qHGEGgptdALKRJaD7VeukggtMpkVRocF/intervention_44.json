How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username by recognizing the name pattern in a local subreddit. Then later, they told other friends about it, showed the account, and the friend got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy aspects. The friend used a username that was almost their real name, which might have been a mistake. The author didn't do anything malicious, just shared the account because they found it obvious. But the friend felt their privacy was invaded. \n\nReddit users often assume a level of anonymity, even if their usernames aren't fully hidden. The friend might have expected that their online activity, even with a semi-real name, wouldn't be disclosed IRL. The author's action, while not illegal, could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nHowever, the friend's username made their identity guessable. The author didn't hack or steal the account info; they just recognized it. The friends at the bar were teased, and the friend got upset. The author might argue they had no malicious intent. \n\nBut intent doesn't always absolve responsibility. Even if the action wasn't harmful, the friend felt violated. The key is whether the author respected the friend's reasonable expectation of privacy. Since the friend didn't want their Reddit identity known outside Reddit, the author's sharing it could be wrong. \n\nAlso, the \"sacred Reddit code\" the friend mentioned might be a real sentiment among users who value online anonymity. The author's defense about the username is valid but doesn't negate the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, while the author didn't act with malice, they might have overstepped by exposing the account without consent. The answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because privacy expectations matter, even if the method of discovery was accidental.\n"
