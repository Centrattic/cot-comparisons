How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. \n\nFirst, the backstory: the author found their friend's Reddit account through a local subreddit. The friend's username was obvious with their first name and part of the last name. The author looked up the friend's history but didn't find anything scandalous.\n\nThen, at a bar trivia night, the author told the group about finding the account and showed it to others. The friend was upset, claiming it's a \"sacred Reddit code\" not to expose accounts. The author argues that the friend's username made it easy to identify him, so the friend's own choice of username contributed to the issue.\n\nThe friend was annoyed, but the other friends didn't think it was a big deal. The author didn't share anything private or harmful, just the account name and maybe some posts. The key points here are consent and privacy. \n\nReddit is a public platform, so someone's posts and account are visible unless they set them to private. However, the friend might have expected a certain level of anonymity, especially using a username with personal information. The author's action was sharing the account name with friends, which could be seen as violating that expected anonymity. But since the account name was public and the friend used an identifiable username, the argument is whether the friend is partly at fault.\n\nIn general, exposing someone's online presence without their consent can be an issue, even if the content isn't harmful. The line between sharing public information and violating privacy can be thin. The author might argue that the friend's choice of username made it too obvious, but others might say that the author shouldn't have shared it regardless. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the friend didn't want their Reddit activity to be known by others, even if the account was public, the author might have crossed a boundary by showing it to friends. But if the account was public and the username was easily identifiable, maybe the friend has some responsibility too. \n\nBut the main action here is the author sharing the friend's account without permission. Even if the account was public, revealing it to others who weren't following the subreddit might not be the author's fault entirely. However, the friend's privacy expectations might be reasonable. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were likely within the bounds of public information, but sharing it with friends might have breached the friend's trust or privacy expectations. So maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong), but others might say B. Hmm.\n"
