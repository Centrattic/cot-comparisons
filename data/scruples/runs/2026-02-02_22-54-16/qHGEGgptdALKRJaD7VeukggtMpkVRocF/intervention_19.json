How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the friend used an obvious username (first name plus first three letters of last name) in a small community subreddit. The author found the account, didn't do anything malicious, and then shared it with friends during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset about being exposed, but the author argues that the username was too obvious and that there's no \"secret code\" about keeping Reddit accounts private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles of privacy and consent. The friend didn't intend for his account to be exposed. Even if the username was obvious, the act of revealing it to others might breach his privacy. The author didn't ask for permission before sharing the account, which could be a key point here.\n\nAlso, the context of Reddit's culture: maybe there's an unspoken rule about keeping accounts separate from real life. The friend's reaction suggests that he values this separation. The author might not see it as a big deal, but the friend does. The author's argument is that the username was too obvious, but that doesn't negate the friend's feelings about it. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't post the account publicly or use it for harm, just showed it to friends during a casual conversation. The friends made fun of the friend for being triggered, which complicates things. However, the main issue is whether the author overstepped by exposing the account without consent.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about respecting boundaries. Even if the friend's username was guessable, the author didn't have permission to share that information. The act of exposing it, even in a lighthearted way, could be seen as a breach of trust. So, the author might be in the wrong. But some might argue that since the account was public and the username was obvious, it's not the author's fault. However, the key point is whether the author should have considered the friend's privacy. \n\nGiven that the author didn't think it was a big deal, but the friend was upset, it's a case of differing expectations. The author might have violated the friend's privacy without realizing it. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't get consent and exposed personal information, even if it was public.\n"
