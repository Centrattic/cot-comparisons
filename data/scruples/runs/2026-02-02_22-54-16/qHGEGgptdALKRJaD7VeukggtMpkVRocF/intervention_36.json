How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author found their friend's Reddit account because the friend used a username that was almost their real name in a small community subreddit. They then told other friends about it, showed them the account, and the friend got upset. The friend claims there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" against exposing accounts in real life. The author argues that since the friend used a nearly real name in a local subreddit, they shouldn't be surprised.\n\nHmm. First, the key points here are privacy expectations. Reddit is an online platform where people might use pseudonyms or partial names, but in this case, the friend's username was almost their real name. The author didn't do anything illegal, just shared the account with others. But is sharing someone's online account without their consent a breach of trust?\n\nReddit does have a policy where users can report harassment or public exposure of private information, but this is about an account that was publicly visible. However, the friend might have intended to keep their Reddit activity private, even if their username was obvious. The author might have violated that privacy by sharing the account with friends.\n\nBut wait, the friend used a username that made it easy to identify them. Maybe the friend didn't take proper precautions to keep their identity hidden. If someone uses a unique username that gives away their identity, can they reasonably expect privacy? It's a bit of a gray area. The author didn't do anything malicious, just revealed the account to others who already knew the friend. The friend was upset, but others thought it was funny.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is about a \"secret code,\" but Reddit doesn't have an official rule against this. It's more about personal privacy. The author might not be in the wrong because the friend's username was too obvious, but on the other hand, sharing someone's online persona without their okay could be considered a breach of trust, even if it's public.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author didn't do anything against Reddit's rules, but they might have crossed a social line by revealing their friend's account. However, since the friend's username was so identifiable, maybe the fault isn't entirely on the author. But ultimately, sharing someone's online account without their permission is a privacy issue, even if it's public. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they violated their friend's privacy. But others might argue B (not in the wrong) because the friend didn't take steps to protect their identity. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A because privacy violations are about intent and respect, even if the information is technically public.\n"
