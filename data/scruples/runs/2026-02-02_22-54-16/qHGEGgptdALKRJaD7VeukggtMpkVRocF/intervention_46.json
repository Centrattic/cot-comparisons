How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was their first name plus the first three letters of their last name. Then, when they met up with the friend and other friends, the author told them about this and showed the account. The friend got upset about it, feeling like there's a \"sacred code\" against exposing Reddit accounts in real life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and consent. The friend used a username that's very close to their real identity, which might be part of the issue. If someone uses a username that's almost their real name in a small community, is that expected to be private? Maybe not. The author points out that the friend's choice of username made it easy to identify him. However, even if the username is obvious, does that mean it's okay to expose it to others? The line here is about respecting someone's privacy, regardless of how public they think their online presence is.\n\nReddit users often assume a certain level of anonymity, even if their usernames aren't completely private. The friend might have felt that their online presence was a personal space, and the author violating that by sharing it with others, even if the content wasn't inappropriate, was a breach of trust. The fact that the author didn't think it was a big deal but the friend did suggests that the author didn't consider the friend's perspective on privacy.\n\nAlso, the author's action of showing the account to others could be seen as violating the friend's expectation of online privacy. Even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of exposing someone's account without their consent might be problematic. The argument that the friend should have used a more anonymous username doesn't fully absolve the author because it's about respecting boundaries regardless of how public the information was.\n\nSo, even though the friend's username made it easy to identify them, the author's action of revealing the account to others without permission might be considered a breach of privacy. The friend's reaction, while perhaps over the top, is valid in the sense that they wanted to keep their online identity separate from real life. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that boundary.\n"
