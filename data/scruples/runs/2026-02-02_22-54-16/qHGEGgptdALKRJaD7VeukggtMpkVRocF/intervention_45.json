How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for exposing a friend's Reddit account to others. The situation involves the friend using an identifiable username in a local subreddit, which the author discovered. The author then shared this with mutual friends, leading to the friend getting upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy and consent. The friend created a Reddit account with his name and part of his last name, making it easy to identify him in a small community. The author found this and shared it with friends, not out of malice but curiosity and a bit of humor. The friend felt his Reddit privacy was violated, claiming a \"secret code\" against exposing accounts. But Reddit isn't exactly a hidden platform; many people use it openly. However, the expectation of anonymity might be higher here since the friend didn't use a pseudonym that obscured his identity.\n\nThe author argues that the friend's choice of username made it obvious, and thus, the author isn't at fault. But even if the username was identifiable, sharing someone's online presence without their consent can be a breach of trust. The friend's upset reaction suggests he valued his privacy, even if others didn't take it seriously. The author might not have intended harm, but the action still caused distress. So, while the friend's username was a clue, the act of exposing it without asking could still be wrong. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because privacy expectations can vary, and even if the info was public, sharing it without consent can violate trust.\n"
