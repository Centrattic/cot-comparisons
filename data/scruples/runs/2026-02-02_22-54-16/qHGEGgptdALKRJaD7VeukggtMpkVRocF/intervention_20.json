How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by exposing their friend's Reddit account to their other friends. The situation involves the author discovering their friend's Reddit account through the username, which was obviously linked to their real identity. Then, the author shared this account in a social setting, which caused the friend to be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend used a username that's close to their real name, making it easy to identify them. The author found this out and showed the account to others. Even though there's nothing harmful posted, the act of exposing someone's online presence without consent could be seen as a privacy violation. But maybe the friend's use of a real name username implies there's no expectation of anonymity. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the username is obvious, people might still expect their online activities to remain separate from their real-life interactions. The friend might feel that their private online persona is being invaded by being exposed to others. The author argues that the friend didn't hide their identity well, so the fault lies with the friend. But is that a valid defense?\n\nAlso, the friends' reaction was to mock the friend for getting upset. This might downplay the seriousness of the situation. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Did the author respect the friend's privacy, even if it wasn't well-kept? The author didn't post anything online, just showed the account to friends in person. But showing it in person could still be a breach of trust.\n\nReddit's \"sacred code\" mentioned is about keeping accounts private in the real world. While not an official rule, it's a common understanding in online communities. The author might be violating that unspoken rule. However, the username made the identity obvious, so maybe the friend's fault is in using a non-anonymous username.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The author didn't know the account was theirs at first, but once they found out, sharing it could be seen as crossing a line, even if unintentionally. The friend's username choice might have contributed, but that doesn't absolve the author entirely. The key factors are intent and the expectation of privacy. The author might not be in the wrong because the friend didn't protect their identity, but the act of sharing could still be considered a breach. However, given the context and the lack of malicious intent, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong.\n"
