How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username by recognizing the name and some letters of the last name. Then, they told other friends about it and showed them the account during a trivia night. The friend was upset, thinking it's a breach of some Reddit code.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the privacy aspect. The friend used a username that's almost their real name, which might imply they didn't want it to be a secret. But does that mean it's okay to expose it? Maybe the friend didn't realize how obvious their username was. The author might argue that using an obvious username in a small community subreddit makes it public knowledge. But others might say that even if the username is obvious, revealing it without consent is a privacy issue.\n\nReddit does have a culture where users prefer anonymity, even if their usernames are semi-public. The \"sacred Reddit code\" mentioned might be a reference to that unspoken rule. The author's action of showing the account to friends could be seen as violating that trust. The friend's reaction suggests they felt their privacy was invaded, even if the username was guessable.\n\nAlso, the author's intent was curiosity and sharing a story, not malicious intent. However, the impact on the friend was negative. The key here is whether the author should have respected the friend's privacy despite the username being guessable. The author might not have intended harm, but the act of exposing the account without asking could be considered wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's choice of username might be part of the problem. Using a username that's almost their real name in a small community subreddit could be seen as a public identifier. However, the line between public and private is blurry here. The author's action led to the friend feeling upset, which indicates a breach of trust.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's username choice might have made it easier to identify, the author's action of exposing it to others without consent is likely a breach of privacy. Even if the username was obvious, the friend's discomfort shows that the action was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
