How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found their friend's Reddit account because the username was very obvious\u2014using their real first name and the first three letters of the last name. The friend was posting in a local subreddit, which makes sense why the username is so recognizable. The author then told their other friends about it, showed them the account, and the friend got upset. The author argues that since the friend used a username that's almost their real name in a local community, they should expect that someone might figure it out. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Let me consider the key points. The first thing is privacy. Reddit users often have usernames that are not their real names, but this friend's username was very close to their real name. So maybe the friend didn't take proper precautions to keep their Reddit identity private. If the username is so obvious, then others might be able to figure out who it is. But does that mean it's okay to expose it?\n\nAnother angle is consent. The friend probably didn't want their Reddit presence to be known by others. Even if the username is recognizable, does that mean others have the right to share that information? The author thought it was harmless because the friend's posts weren't offensive, but the friend felt violated. The friends at the bar laughed at the friend for getting upset, which might downplay the seriousness of the situation.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of trust. Friends might expect that their online identities, especially those they keep separate from their real lives, are kept private. By exposing the account, the author might have broken that trust, regardless of the username's obviousness. \n\nBut then again, if the friend used a username that's easily identifiable, did they have a reasonable expectation of privacy? The author could argue that the friend's own mistake in choosing a username led to the exposure. However, even if the username is obvious, others might not make the connection unless they actively look for it. The author did take the time to look up the history, which the friend might not have anticipated. \n\nThe friend's reaction is also a factor. If they were genuinely upset, it's important to acknowledge their feelings, even if the author didn't see it as a big deal. The \"sacred Reddit code\" part is a humorous way to describe the unspoken expectation of anonymity, and the author might not have considered that their friend values that privacy more than the username suggests.\n\nIn terms of social norms, exposing someone's online identity without consent, even if it's trivial, can be seen as a breach of privacy. The fact that the author did it in a group of friends and shared it with others might exacerbate the issue. The friend might feel that their personal online space has been invaded, even if the content isn't harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't use the information to embarrass or harm the friend in a significant way. They just showed it to a group of friends who, as it turned out, found it amusing. However, the impact on the friend is still valid, even if others didn't take it seriously.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the friend's lack of privacy precautions vs. the author's actions in exposing the account. The key is whether the author overstepped by sharing it without the friend's consent. Even if the friend's username was obvious, the author made a choice to reveal it, which the friend found offensive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's privacy, regardless of how obvious the username was.\n"
