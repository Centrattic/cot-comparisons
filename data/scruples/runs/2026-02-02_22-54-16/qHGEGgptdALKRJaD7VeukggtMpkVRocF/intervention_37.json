How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account. So, the situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username by recognizing the name and part of the last name. They then showed it to other friends during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset about this, claiming it's against some \"sacred Reddit code,\" but the author thinks it's not a big deal.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the key points here. The friend used a username that's pretty close to their real name in a small community, which makes it easy to identify. The author didn't do anything harmful like sharing private info or embarrassing content. The friend's issue seems to be about privacy expectations even though the username itself was public.\n\nReddit users often use pseudonyms, but in this case, the username is almost their real name. The author didn't hack or do anything sneaky; they just noticed the obvious username. Then, when the author showed it to friends, it was in a social setting where the friend's Reddit presence was discussed. The friend's reaction is based on privacy concerns, but since the username was public and used in a small community, maybe the friend should have used a more anonymous username if they wanted privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the username was public, the act of revealing it in person might be a breach of trust. The author didn't ask the friend for permission to share their account. But the friend's username choice might have made it public knowledge, so maybe the author isn't at fault. The line here is between what's public and what's private. If the friend intended to keep their Reddit activity private, using a non-obvious username would have been better. The author's action isn't malicious, but maybe they should have respected the friend's implied privacy, even if the username was obvious.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't force the exposure. They noticed a public username and shared it in a social context, which others found amusing. The friend's upset is more about their own username choice than the author's action. So, answer B.\n"
