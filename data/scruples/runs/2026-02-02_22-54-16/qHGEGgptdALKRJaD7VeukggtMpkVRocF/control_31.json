How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious\u2014using the friend's first name and part of the last name. They didn't tell anyone at first, but later, when the topic came up in a bar, they showed their friends the account.\n\nThe friend got upset about this. The author argues that since the Reddit account isn't posting anything really bad, and the username was pretty clear, they didn't see the problem. The friend, on the other hand, thinks that there's an unspoken rule about keeping Reddit accounts private.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is privacy. Reddit is a platform where people can use pseudonyms and may expect a certain level of anonymity. Even if the username was obvious, the friend might have intended to keep their online presence separate from their real life. The author didn't ask for permission before exposing the account, which could be a breach of trust, even if the content wasn't harmful.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend shouldn't expect privacy if they used a recognizable username. But I think the key point is that the friend might have wanted to keep their online activity separate. Even if the username is obvious, sharing it without consent could be seen as violating that boundary. The fact that the friend was upset suggests that the author overstepped, regardless of the content of the posts. Also, showing it to other friends in a public setting might have embarrassed the friend or made them feel exposed. \n\nSo, even if the content wasn't bad, the act of sharing someone's private account without their consent is probably wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
