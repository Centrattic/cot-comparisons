How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about exposing a friend's Reddit account to others in person.\n\nFirst, the author found out their friend's Reddit account because the friend used a username that was almost their real name in a small community. The author then told their friends about it without the friend's permission. The friend got upset, saying there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" about keeping accounts private.\n\nSo, the main issue is privacy. Even if the username was guessable, the author didn't ask for permission to share it. The friend might have expected their online activities to remain separate from real life. Even if the content wasn't harmful, exposing someone's online identity without consent could be a breach of trust.\n\nBut the author argues that the friend should have known better about choosing a username. However, just because someone uses a real name doesn't mean they want others to reveal it publicly. The friend's reaction shows they were uncomfortable, which the author should respect.\n\nAlso, the author didn't consider the friend's feelings when sharing the account. Even if the friends teased them, the main point is about respecting boundaries. So, the author might be in the wrong for not getting permission and for disregarding the friend's privacy, regardless of the username choice.\n"
