How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the friend's Reddit account was easy to identify because he used his first name and some last name initials. The author found the account, told others about it, and even showed it to their friends. The friend got upset, claiming it's a \"sacred Reddit code\" not to expose accounts in real life.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about privacy and expectations. The friend used a username that's almost his real name in a local subreddit, which made it obvious. The author didn't realize the friend didn't want his Reddit identity known. But is the author at fault here?\n\nReddit users might have different privacy expectations. If the friend used a unique username in a public subreddit, maybe he didn't expect it to be private. But even so, exposing someone's online identity without their consent could be a breach of trust. The author might argue that the friend was the one making it easy to find, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's okay to expose it. The friend's reaction suggests he didn't want that information shared.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. They were just curious and shared the story with friends, thinking it wasn't a big deal. But the friend felt it was a violation. So even if the friend's username was obvious, the act of exposing it without permission is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author said they browsed the friend's Reddit history. Maybe that's an invasion of privacy even if there was nothing harmful. So the author did something that the friend might not have consented to.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's username was easy to guess, the author's actions of exposing it and showing it to others might be considered a breach of trust. Even if the friend's privacy was not as secure as he thought, the author should have respected his privacy and not shared it without consent. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
