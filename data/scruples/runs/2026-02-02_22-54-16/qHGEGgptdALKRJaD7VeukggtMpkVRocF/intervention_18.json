How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found out a friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, then later showed it to mutual friends. The friend got upset, and others made fun of him. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend used a username that was almost their full name, which made it easy to identify. The author didn't do anything illegal, just shared the account with friends. But maybe there's an expectation of anonymity on Reddit. Reddit users might not want their online personas linked to their real lives, even if they use real names. So by exposing the account, the author violated that unspoken rule of keeping Reddit separate.\n\nHowever, the friend's username was a clue. If someone uses a username that's too obvious, they might be contributing to the problem. The author didn't actively search for the account beyond what was obvious. Also, they didn't share anything harmful\u2014just the account itself. But the friend was upset, so maybe the author should have respected the unspoken boundary regardless.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't know the username was sensitive. They thought it was harmless because the friend wasn't posting anything bad. The friends laughed at the friend's reaction, implying that maybe the friend overreacted. The author might not be in the wrong since they didn't have malicious intent and the friend's username was a clue.\n\nBut even if there's no malicious intent, exposing someone's online identity in real life could be a privacy breach. Reddit's culture emphasizes anonymity, so breaking that could be seen as wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the friend's username made the account public information. If the username was a dead giveaway, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the friend expected anonymity despite the obvious username, the author might still be wrong for sharing it.\n\nAnother angle: the author looked up the friend's history without permission. That's a privacy issue. Even if the friend's username was obvious, the author shouldn't have browsed their history. Then, sharing that info with others adds another layer. So maybe the author is in the wrong for both actions. \n\nBut the question is about exposing the account, not the initial browsing. If the author had just found out the account and not told others, maybe it's fine. But they did tell others, which led to the friend's upset. The key is whether exposing the account without consent is wrong. Even if the username was obvious, the friend might not want their online presence known by others. So the author is in the wrong for revealing it, despite the username's cluelessness. Hence, answer A.\n"
