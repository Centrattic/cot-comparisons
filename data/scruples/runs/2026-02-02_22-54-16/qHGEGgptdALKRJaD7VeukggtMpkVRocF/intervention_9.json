How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for exposing a friend's Reddit account to others in person. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author found their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was almost their full name. They then told other friends about it and showed the account during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset, claiming it's against some \"sacred Reddit code\" not to expose accounts in real life.\n\nSo, the key factors here are: How did the friend get the account name? The username was almost their full name, and the community is small, so it's likely guessable. The author didn't hack into the account or do anything sneaky; they just recognized the username. Then, they shared it with friends, who didn't find it a big deal except the friend in question.\n\nThe friend's reaction is about privacy. Even if the username is obvious, there's an expectation of anonymity on Reddit. By exposing it, the author might have violated that unspoken understanding. The author argues it's not a big deal because the friend's posts aren't offensive, but the main issue is about respecting the friend's privacy, not the content itself. \n\nThe author didn't ask for permission before sharing the account info. Even if the friend's username is guessable, sharing it without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. The friend's upset reaction suggests they valued their Reddit identity as separate from real life. The author's defense about the username being obvious doesn't negate the fact that sharing it without permission might be crossing a line, as the friend intended to keep their online presence separate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything malicious. They found the account through public means and shared it in a social setting, perhaps not realizing the importance of the friend's privacy. The friends at the bar didn't see it as a big deal, which might indicate that the issue is more about the friend's personal boundaries than the author's intent.\n\nReddit's culture does emphasize anonymity, and there's an unspoken rule about not revealing someone's real identity or their Reddit account. However, the author didn't reveal personal info beyond what's already public. The problem is more about exposing the account in real life, which the friend found intrusive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions weren't malicious, but they did act without considering the friend's privacy expectations. The friend's right to keep their online identity separate from real life should be respected, even if the username is guessable. The author might not be in the wrong in a legal sense, but socially, they might have overstepped. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether respecting the friend's privacy is more important than the author's actions. Since the friend felt violated and the act of sharing without consent is a breach of trust, the author is likely in the wrong, even if unintentionally.\n"
