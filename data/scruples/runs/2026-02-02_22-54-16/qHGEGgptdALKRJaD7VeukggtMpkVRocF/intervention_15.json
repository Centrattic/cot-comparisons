How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing a friend's Reddit account to their mutual friends. The backstory is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username by recognizing the pattern of their name in a local subreddit. Then, during a trivia night, they told others about it and showed the account, which upset the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend used a username that was almost their real name in a local community subreddit, which made it easy to identify. The author didn't take Reddit seriously and thought it wasn't a big deal to share the account. The friend, however, felt that this was a violation of Reddit's implied privacy, hence getting upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did something wrong. On one hand, the friend made their username partially identifiable, which the author used to find their account. But usernames, even if they include part of a real name, are still pseudonyms. People might not expect their online personas to be revealed to others in real life, even if the username is obvious. The author then shared this information without permission, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the content wasn't harmful, exposing someone's online identity without consent might be considered a privacy issue.\n\nHowever, the friend's username was very close to their real name, which could imply that they weren't taking privacy seriously. The author argues that they didn't think it was a big deal because the friend's posts weren't embarrassing. But the friend's reaction suggests that they did value their privacy. So, even if the username was obvious, the act of sharing it without consent might have crossed a line.\n\nReddit culture often emphasizes anonymity, so there's an unspoken agreement not to reveal others' usernames. The author's friends laughed it off, but the fact that the friend was genuinely upset indicates that the author violated their trust. The key here is consent. The author didn't ask if it was okay to share the account, so from the friend's perspective, it was a betrayal of privacy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the username might have been easy to guess, the author shared it without permission. Privacy is still a factor here, and respecting someone's wish to keep their online presence separate from real life is important. So, the author might be in the wrong because they exposed the friend's account without consent, even if the username wasn't a secret.\n"
