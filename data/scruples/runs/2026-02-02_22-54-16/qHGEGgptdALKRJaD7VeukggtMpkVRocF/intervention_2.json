How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others in real life. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author discovered their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was almost their full name. They looked at the history but didn't post anything. Then, during a trivia night, they told the group about finding the account and showed it to them. The friend was upset, saying it's a \"sacred Reddit code\" not to expose accounts, but the author argued that since the username was almost their real name, it's not a big deal. The friends found it funny, but the friend was genuinely upset.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider privacy. Reddit is a platform where users often use pseudonyms to maintain anonymity. The friend might have expected a certain level of privacy, even if their username was close to their real name. The author found the account and shared it with others, which could be seen as violating that privacy. Even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of exposing the account could breach trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the friend didn't take precautions to stay anonymous (using a username with their real name). However, that's a bit of a stretch because Reddit's whole purpose is for people to use pseudonyms, and users generally assume that their online identities are separate from their real lives. The friend's choice of username might have been careless, but that doesn't mean the author is justified in exposing it. \n\nThe key here is whether the author respected their friend's privacy. By showing the account to others, the author potentially put the friend in a situation where they felt their private online activity was shared without consent. Even if the content wasn't embarrassing, the breach of trust is significant. \n\nThe author might not see it as a big deal because the content was innocuous, but the friend's reaction shows that they valued their online identity's privacy. The author's action, while maybe not malicious, still crossed a line by sharing something personal without the friend's permission. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they shared their friend's online identity without consent, regardless of the username's obviousness. Privacy expectations matter here, and the friend has a right to be upset about their Reddit account being exposed to real-life friends.\n"
