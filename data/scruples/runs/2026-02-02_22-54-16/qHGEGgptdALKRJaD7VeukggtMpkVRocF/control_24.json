How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author found their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which included the friend's first name and part of the last name. Since they live in a small community, it's easy to figure out who it is. The author then looked at the friend's history but didn't find anything scandalous. Later, they told their friends about this and showed them the account during a bar trivia night. The friend got upset, feeling like the author broke some Reddit code. The author argues that the friend shouldn't have used such an obvious username in a local subreddit.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author respect the friend's privacy? The friend didn't explicitly say it was private, but using a username with part of their real name in a public platform like Reddit might imply some level of privacy. The author's actions led to the friend's account being exposed to others, which the friend found uncomfortable. The friend's reaction is valid because even if the content isn't harmful, the act of exposing someone's online identity without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The author might think they're not in the wrong because the username was obvious, but privacy expectations can vary. The friend's \"sacred Reddit code\" might be a cultural norm among Reddit users, which the author didn't consider. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the friend's choice of username was careless. However, the author had the responsibility to respect the friend's privacy even if they found the account. The fact that the friend got upset shows that the author's actions had a negative impact. So, even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of exposing the account without permission is a privacy violation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't seek consent and shared someone's online presence without considering their privacy expectations.\n"
