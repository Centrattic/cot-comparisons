How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which used the friend's first name and part of the last name. Then, later, when talking with friends, they mentioned this and showed the account to others. The friend got upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author accessed the account without permission. Even if the username was obvious, using it to look up the account and then sharing it with others could be a privacy issue. The friend was using Reddit under a username that, while not entirely anonymous, might have expected some level of privacy. The author's actions exposed the friend's online presence to others, which the friend didn't appreciate. \n\nThe author argues that the friend used a username that was too obvious, but usernames can still be a form of online identity, and people might not want their real identities associated with their online activity. Even if the content isn't harmful, the act of revealing the account without consent is a breach of privacy. \n\nAlso, the friends made fun of the friend for being upset, which adds to the problem. The author's justification that they didn't take Reddit seriously doesn't negate the friend's discomfort. Privacy expectations vary, but once someone's identity is linked to their online activity, others might have a right to expect it's kept private unless they choose to share it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did something that violated their friend's privacy without consent, even if it was done casually. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
