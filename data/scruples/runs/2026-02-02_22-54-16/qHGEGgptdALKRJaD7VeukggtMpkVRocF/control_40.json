How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend had a Reddit account with a username that was pretty obvious it was him\u2014first name and first three letters of the last name. The author found this out while browsing a subreddit related to their small community. Then, later, they told other friends about it and showed them the account. The friend was upset about this, feeling it's a breach of some kind of Reddit \"code,\" while the author thinks it's not a big deal because the friend used an obvious username.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's username was easily identifiable, the author discovered it through legitimate means (just browsing the subreddit), and then shared the account with others. The friend felt his privacy was violated.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on concepts of privacy and consent. Even if the username was guessable, does that mean it's okay to expose someone's online presence to others? \n\nIn many cases, people use pseudonyms online for various reasons, even if they're somewhat identifiable. By using a username that includes part of their real name, the friend might have inadvertently made their identity guessable, but that doesn't necessarily mean others should exploit that. The author, by showing others the account, might have violated the friend's expectation of privacy, even if the friend's own choices made it possible.\n\nReddit users often assume a level of anonymity or pseudonymity, even if they don't use completely incognito usernames. The idea that exposing someone's account to real-life friends is crossing a line is not unreasonable. The friend's reaction might be based on the principle that online activities, even if public, shouldn't be shared without consent beyond the platform's intended audience.\n\nThe author argues they didn't do anything harmful since the content wasn't bad, but the act itself could be seen as a breach of trust. Friends might expect that their online presence, even if public, isn't brought into real-life interactions unless they choose to do so themselves. The other friends making fun of the upset friend might have influenced the situation, but the main issue is the author's action.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the friend's username was guessable, sharing someone's online account with others without their consent might be considered a privacy violation. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, crossed a boundary by exposing the friend's Reddit presence to others, which the friend found offensive. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
