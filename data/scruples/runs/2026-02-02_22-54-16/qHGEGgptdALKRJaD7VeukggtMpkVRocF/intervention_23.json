How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which was their first name plus the first three letters of the last name. The community is small, so that makes sense. They browsed the friend's history but didn't find anything problematic. Later, they told other friends about this during a bar trivia night and showed the account. The friend got upset, thinking it's against some Reddit \"code\" not to expose accounts in real life. The author argues that using a nearly full name on a local subreddit is not private.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author violate any trust or privacy? The friend used a username that's almost their full name in a small community, making it easy to identify. The author didn't post anything online but shared the account in person with friends. The friend felt it was a breach, even if the content wasn't embarrassing. The author's friends made fun of the friend for getting upset.\n\nReddit's policies don't explicitly mention exposing accounts in real life, but there's a community norm of privacy. Even if the username was obvious, sharing someone's account without consent could be seen as a privacy issue. The author might argue that the friend didn't take precautions, but the act of exposing the account, regardless of content, could be a breach of trust. The friend's reaction suggests that they value their Reddit anonymity, which the author might have disregarded. So, even if the content wasn't bad, the action itself might be wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because sharing someone's online identity without permission is a privacy issue, regardless of the content or username choice.\n"
