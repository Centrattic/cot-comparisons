How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe user found their friend's Reddit account because the friend used a username that was almost their real name in a small community. They didn't tell anyone initially but later mentioned it to their friends at a bar, and the friend got upset. The author thinks they're not wrong, but the friend feels like there's a \"sacred code\" against exposing Reddit accounts.\n\nFirst, the author didn't ask for the friend's username, but they recognized it because of the obvious name and the small community. They looked at the history, which wasn't anything scandalous. Then, when the topic of Reddit came up, they told their friends and showed the account. The friend was upset, and others made fun of him for being triggered. The author argues that if someone is using a real name in a local subreddit, they shouldn't expect privacy. \n\nHmm. So the key points here are: Did the author violate any trust? The friend didn't hide their identity on Reddit, but maybe they expected it to stay online. The author didn't do anything illegal, but maybe crossed a social boundary. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's the idea of privacy. Even if the name is obvious, the friend might have wanted to keep their online activity separate from their real life. By sharing the account with others, the author exposed their friend's online presence to their IRL friends, which the friend found offensive. \n\nThe author might argue that the friend should have used a pseudonym, but the friend didn't do that. However, people can make mistakes in choosing usernames, and expecting others to not connect the dots isn't unreasonable. The act of showing the account to others, even if it's just to point out the obvious, could be seen as violating the friend's privacy. \n\nAlso, the author's friends made fun of the friend for being triggered. That might suggest that the group sees the friend's reaction as overblown, but the fact that the friend was actually upset shows that it affected them. The author's action might be considered a breach of trust or a privacy issue, even if it's not a huge deal to others. \n\nIn terms of Reddit's community norms, there's a culture of anonymity, and revealing someone's real identity without consent is generally frowned upon. But in this case, the username was almost their real name, so it's less about identity exposure and more about sharing their online activity. Still, the friend might value the separation between their online persona and real life. \n\nSo while the author didn't do anything illegal, they might have acted inconsiderately by not respecting their friend's possible expectation of privacy in their online activities. Even if the content wasn't embarrassing, the act of exposing the account could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they shared something that their friend wanted to keep separate from their personal life, regardless of how obvious the username was. The friend's reaction indicates that they did feel their privacy was invaded, so the author's action, while not malicious, could still be considered a misstep.\n"
