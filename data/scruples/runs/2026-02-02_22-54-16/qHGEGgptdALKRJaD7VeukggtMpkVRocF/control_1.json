How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found their friend's Reddit account because the friend used a username that was almost their real name in a small community. The author then told their friends about it during a trivia night and showed them the account. The friend got upset about it, feeling it violated some \"sacred Reddit code.\" The author argues that the friend shouldn't have used a username that's so identifiable, and the friend didn't post anything too bad\u2014just sports-related comments.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author overstepped by sharing the friend's account. Let's consider privacy. Reddit is a public platform, but people might use pseudonyms for privacy. Even if the username is obvious, the friend might expect a level of anonymity. The author did expose the friend's online identity to others, which could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the content wasn't harmful.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests he felt it was a violation. The author didn't ask for permission to share the account. Even if the friend's username was obvious, the act of showing others without consent could be problematic. The author's justification that the friend shouldn't expect privacy because of the username might not hold, as people might still want their online presence to remain within the platform unless they choose to share it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything malicious. The friend's content wasn't embarrassing, and the author didn't expose personal info. The group of friends were already joking about it, and the friend's reaction was maybe over the top. But the key point is consent. The author didn't have permission to share the account, even if it was in a friendly setting.\n\nIn social norms, respecting others' privacy is important. Even if the platform is public, there's an unspoken agreement not to out people's identities unless they've made themselves public. The author might have breached that trust. So, even though the friend's username was a clue, the act of exposing it without asking is probably where the mistake lies.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong because they shared their friend's account without permission, violating their privacy expectations even if unintentionally.\n"
