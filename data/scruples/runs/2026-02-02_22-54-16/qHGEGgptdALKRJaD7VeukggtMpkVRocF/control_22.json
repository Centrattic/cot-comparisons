How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username because it was obvious from the name and the local subreddit. Then, when they met up with friends, they told the story and showed the friend's Reddit account. The friend was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy issues. Even if the friend used a username that's almost their real name, that doesn't necessarily mean they want their online activity shared with others. People might use Reddit to vent or make jokes without others knowing. The author might have thought it wasn't a big deal, but the friend felt violated. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests that they value their Reddit presence as separate from real life. The author didn't ask for permission before showing the account to others. Even if the content wasn't embarrassing, the act of exposing someone's online identity without consent could be a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's username was very identifiable, so maybe the author thought it wasn't a secret. But the key point is whether the author respected the friend's privacy. The friend's upset reaction indicates that they didn't appreciate it. \n\nSo, even if the content wasn't harmful, sharing someone's online account without their consent is a privacy issue. The author didn't consider the friend's feelings and boundaries. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
