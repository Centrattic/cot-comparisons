How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found their friend's Reddit account because the username was obviously their friend's. They looked up the friend's history but didn't share it then. Later, when they were at a bar, they mentioned the account to their friends and showed it to them. The friend got upset, thinking it's a breach of privacy, while the author didn't think it was a big deal because the content wasn't harmful.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy and consent. The friend might have intended their Reddit activity to remain private, even if the username was guessable. By sharing the account with others, the author is exposing their friend's online presence without permission. Even if the content isn't embarrassing, the act of revealing someone's online identity without their consent could be seen as a violation of their privacy. \n\nReddit is a platform where people might use pseudonyms or not want their online activities linked to their real lives. The friend might have chosen that username without considering that someone in their real life could recognize it. However, the author's actions still took that information and shared it in person, which the friend found upsetting. \n\nThe author argues that the username wasn't a secret, but just because someone uses a username that's easy to guess doesn't mean they want others to expose it. The friend's reaction suggests that they valued the separation between their online persona and real life. The author's defense that the content wasn't bad doesn't negate the breach of trust. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the friend overreacted, the author didn't have their consent to share the account. So, while the outcome wasn't harmful, the act itself was a privacy violation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that the friend didn't take reasonable steps to protect their identity. However, the expectation of privacy on Reddit can vary. If someone uses a username that's traceable, does that negate their expectation of privacy? It's a gray area, but generally, people might not expect their online activities to be linked to their real identities unless they explicitly do so. \n\nThe key here is consent. Without it, sharing someone's online account in person is a breach. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect their friend's privacy, even if the friend's username was guessable.\n"
