How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who exposed their friend's Reddit account is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username by recognizing the name pattern in a local subreddit. Then, when they met up with friends, they shared the story and showed the account to others. The friend got upset about it, and the author is now seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The friend used a username that was almost his real name, which made it easy to identify. The author didn't do anything malicious, just shared the account with friends. The friend was upset about being exposed, but the author argues that the username wasn't private and that the content wasn't harmful.\n\nSo, the main points to analyze are: Did the author violate any trust? The friend's username was public, so technically, anyone could find it. However, sharing someone's online identity without their consent might be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the information is public. The friend's reaction suggests that he expected some level of anonymity on Reddit, which the author disrupted by exposing his account.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that the friend used a non-anonymous username. But even if someone uses a public username, there's an unspoken expectation that others won't share that information without permission. The act of showing the account to friends might have gone beyond what the friend was comfortable with, regardless of the content of the posts.\n\nThe friend's anger might be about the exposure rather than the content. The author didn't share private messages or embarrassing posts, but the act of exposing the account itself was enough to upset the friend. This is where the line between public information and personal privacy can be blurry.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the information is public, sharing it without consent can be seen as violating someone's trust. The author might argue that it's not a big deal, but the friend's reaction indicates that it was a breach. The fact that the group made fun of the friend for being triggered suggests that the author and others didn't see it as a big issue, but that doesn't negate the friend's feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they shared someone's online identity without their consent, even if it was public. The friend had a right to expect that their Reddit activity, even with a semi-anonymous username, wouldn't be exposed to others. The author's actions, while not malicious, disregarded the friend's privacy and caused discomfort.\n"
