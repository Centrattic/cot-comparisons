How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. \n\nFirst, the backstory: The author found out their friend's Reddit username by noticing the obvious name combination in a local subreddit. They then told their friends about it during a bar trivia night, showing them the account. The friend got upset, feeling it violated some \"sacred Reddit code,\" but the author argues that using an almost-real name in a small community subreddit was a risk.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author breach privacy? Was the friend's username too obvious? The author didn't post anything from the account publicly beyond showing it to friends present. The friend's main complaint seems to be about the exposure of their online identity, which they might have wanted to keep separate from their real life.\n\nReddit culture often values anonymity, so even if the username is partly real, people might not expect their online presence to be revealed offline. The author didn't have malicious intent, just shared it as a story and showed the account. However, sharing someone's online identity without consent, even if it's not illegal, can be a privacy issue. \n\nBut the friend's username was quite identifiable, and the author didn't go out of their way to uncover it\u2014it was already public in a local subreddit. The action of showing it to friends might be seen as minor, but it's about consent. The author didn't ask for permission, which is a factor. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer hinges on whether the friend's privacy was unjustly invaded. Since the username was public and the context was a small community, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the act of exposing someone's online identity without their consent could still be considered a breach of trust, even if the info was public. But in this case, since it was a local subreddit and the name was obvious, there's an argument that the friend should have kept his username more private. \n\nThe author's justification is that the friend's username wasn't secure. So, maybe the author isn't at fault here. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's a middle ground where both sides have points. However, the user is asking for a binary choice between A and B. Given that the username was public and the friend's own choice to use an identifiable name, the author might not be in the wrong. So I'll go with B.\n"
