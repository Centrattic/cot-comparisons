How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username, which was obvious because of the local community and the username structure. Then, when talking at a bar, the author showed the friend's Reddit history to others. The friend got upset about it, and the author is wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend used a username that included their real name, but maybe they didn't expect it to be so easy to figure out. Even if the username is partly their real name, using a pseudonym on Reddit is common, and people might assume a level of anonymity. The author found the account by connecting the username to the friend, which might not be illegal, but does that cross into violating privacy?\n\nThen, the act of exposing the account to others. The author didn't do anything harmful like sharing private messages or sensitive info, just showed the Reddit posts. The friend was annoyed because of the \"sacred Reddit code\" of keeping accounts private. But is that a valid reason? The author's friends found it funny, but the friend felt his privacy was invaded.\n\nAnother angle: the small community aspect. In a small town, people might be more cautious about their online presence because it's easier to be identified. The friend might have thought their Reddit activity was private, even if the username was a clue. The author's action could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the content wasn't embarrassing.\n\nAlso, the author's justification: they didn't think it was a big deal, and the friend's username made it obvious. But does that matter? If someone chooses a username that's close to their real name, does that mean they forfeit privacy? Not necessarily. People can make mistakes with usernames, and expecting others to respect their privacy, even if the username is a hint, is reasonable.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might have crossed a line. The friend's reaction suggests that they felt their privacy was invaded, and even if the content wasn't bad, the act of exposing the account could be considered a breach. The author should consider that the friend's privacy was important to them, regardless of how the username was constructed. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they violated their friend's privacy, even if unintentionally.\n"
