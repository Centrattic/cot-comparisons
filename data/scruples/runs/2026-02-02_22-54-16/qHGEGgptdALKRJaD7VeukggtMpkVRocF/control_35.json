How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to other friends. The situation involves the author figuring out their friend's Reddit username, which was almost his real name, and then showing it to others at a bar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend used a username that was mostly his real name, which is publicly visible. The author discovered this on their own by browsing the subreddit. Even though the username is obvious, the friend might have expected some level of anonymity or not wanted their Reddit activity known by others. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. Did the author respect the friend's privacy? The friend didn't hide their identity on Reddit, but maybe they expected their online persona to stay separate from real life. \n2. Was there any malicious intent? The author didn't post the account publicly or do anything harmful beyond showing it to friends. \n3. The friend got upset, so even if the author thought it was harmless, it affected the friend negatively. \n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's online identity without permission can be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the information isn't private. The friend's reaction suggests that they valued their Reddit presence as separate. The author's defense that the username was obvious might not justify exposing it. \n\nAlso, the \"sacred Reddit code\" mentioned by the friend might be a joke, but the author's action crossed into real-life exposure, which could be uncomfortable for the friend. The other friends made fun of him, which adds to the social pressure. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean harm, the action of exposing the account without consent is problematic. The friend's right to control who knows their online presence is important here. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
