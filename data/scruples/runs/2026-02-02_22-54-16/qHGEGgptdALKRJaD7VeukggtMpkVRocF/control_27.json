How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The user wants a \"A\" or \"B\" answer. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author found their friend's Reddit account by recognizing the username, which included the friend's first name and first three letters of the last name. They then showed it to other friends during a bar trivia night. The friend was upset about this, feeling it violated some Reddit \"code,\" while the author thought it wasn't a big deal because the content wasn't harmful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's username was easy to identify because of the small community and the username choice. The author didn't do anything malicious, just shared the account with others. The friend felt his privacy was invaded.\n\nNow, considering privacy. Even if the username was guessable, people might still expect a certain level of anonymity online. Sharing someone's account without their consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the content isn't harmful, the act of exposing the account could be considered violating trust. The friend's reaction suggests he valued his Reddit activity as private.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the friend shouldn't have used a username that gives away their identity. But that's a common issue with online anonymity\u2014people might not realize how easy it is to identify them in certain contexts, like a small community. However, the responsibility isn't entirely on the user if others can easily figure it out. But the fact remains that the author shared it without permission.\n\nAlso, the social aspect: when the author showed the account to others, even if it was just for fun, it's possible the friend might feel embarrassed if his online presence is seen as a joke or if he prefers keeping it separate from real life. The author might have overstepped by not respecting that boundary.\n\nIn terms of Reddit's \"sacred code,\" while there's no official rule against this, there's an unspoken expectation of privacy. The author's action might have breached that, even if unintentionally. The friend's irritation is valid because his privacy was compromised.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did share private information without consent, which is generally considered wrong. Even if the content wasn't harmful, the act of sharing without permission is a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
