How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for exposing their friend's Reddit account to others. The situation is that the author found out their friend's Reddit username by recognizing the username pattern and first name. Then, when Reddit came up in conversation at the bar, the author showed the friend's account to their other friends. The friend got upset, thinking it violates a \"sacred Reddit code\" of keeping accounts private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the privacy aspect. The friend used a username that's almost their real name, which might have been intentional or not. The author argues that since the username is obvious, it's not a big deal. But even if the username is guessable, does that mean it's okay to share it? Privacy expectations can vary. Reddit users might assume their accounts are anonymous, but using a real name or identifiable info might lower that expectation. However, the friend might still expect that even with that, their account details aren't shared publicly.\n\nThen, the action taken: the author showed the account to friends in person. The friend felt exposed, which matters. The other friends making fun of him might have added to the tension. The author's intent was not malicious, just curiosity and sharing a story. But intent doesn't always absolve consequences. The key here is whether the author respected the friend's privacy. Even if the username is guessable, sharing it in front of others could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the friend didn't want that info shared. The author didn't ask for permission, which is a point against them.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have been overreacting if their username was so obvious. But that's not necessarily the case. People might still expect their online accounts to remain within the digital realm. The author's defense that it's just Reddit and not serious content might not hold if the friend felt violated. The line here is thin. If the author didn't realize the importance of the privacy, maybe they're not evil, but they did act without consent. \n\nConsidering Reddit's culture, there's a certain amount of anonymity, but users might still have unspoken expectations. The author might have violated a mutual understanding without realizing it. So, even if the username was easy to find, sharing it without consent could be seen as a breach of trust, making the author at least partially responsible. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong, because they shared private information without the friend's consent, regardless of the username's guessability.\n"
