How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.\n\nWELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of \"what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username\".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.\n\nAITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our friends IRL?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for revealing their friend's Reddit account to others. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the writer found their friend's Reddit account because the username was obvious, given the small community. They browsed the friend's history but didn't find anything controversial. Then, when talking with friends about Reddit, they mentioned finding the account and showed it to everyone. The friend was upset about this, feeling it violated some Reddit \"code,\" while the writer and others didn't think it was a big deal. Now the writer is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, what's the key here? Privacy is a big factor. Even if the friend used a username that's partly his real name, does that mean he's okay with others knowing it? Maybe not. The writer didn't ask for permission before sharing the account with friends. Even though the content wasn't embarrassing, the act of exposing someone's online identity without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's username was very close to his real name, and the subreddits he was using were local. So maybe the friend didn't expect complete anonymity. The writer might argue that the friend was careless with his privacy. But does that absolve the writer? Probably not. The writer still took it upon themselves to share this information without the friend's approval. \n\nAlso, Reddit users often have a certain expectation of privacy, even if their usernames aren't entirely anonymous. The idea that there's a \"sacred Reddit code\" about not exposing accounts might be more of a community norm, but norms exist for a reason. By sharing the account, the writer potentially put their friend in a situation where others could look up his activity, which could have consequences down the line, even if nothing bad happened this time.\n\nSo even if the content wasn't harmful, the action of sharing someone's online identity without their consent is a privacy issue. The writer might not have malicious intent, but the act itself is a violation of the friend's privacy. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
