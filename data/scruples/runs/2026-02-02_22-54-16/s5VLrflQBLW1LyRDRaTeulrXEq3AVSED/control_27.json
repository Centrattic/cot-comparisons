We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 15-year marriage with four kids. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to the bar regularly. Now, he's against it, saying it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. The author wants to do something fun occasionally, but he might react strongly if she goes against his wishes, like tracking her down or causing a scene. He's controlling and insistent, and she's unsure because of her upbringing and lack of other references.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. Generally, individuals should have autonomy and the right to socialize without their spouse's permission. The husband's control over her actions raises red flags. He's not physically abusive, but his behavior is emotionally controlling and stifling her independence. The fact that he's been dominating her life since she was 16 adds to the concern about her autonomy and ability to assess the situation objectively.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's lack of trust, his insistence on control, and his reaction if she disobeys. The author is a responsible breadwinner, contributing 80% of the income, yet her social needs are dismissed. The husband's justification that it's not fair for him to be alone seems more about his own insecurities than her rights. Socializing with friends is a basic need, and the husband's reaction (causing a scene, keeping her up) is overbearing and unhealthy.\n\nThe community might see the author as justified in wanting personal space, especially since she's a parent balancing family and her own needs. The husband's behavior is more problematic here. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
