We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids. She's been married for 15 years and wants to go out with friends occasionally. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go to bars together. He's not against socializing but specifically for her to go without him, and he feels it's inappropriate. He's controlling, insistent, and might cause issues if she goes. She's responsible for most of the family income and feels trapped.\n\nFirst, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are autonomy in a marriage, social needs, and possible control issues. The husband's reasoning is that he wants to spend time with her and doesn't trust others. He's been with her since she was 16, which is a long time, and she might have internalized his views because of that. The husband's behavior sounds controlling\u2014being insistent, not trusting people, and being clingy. He might be trying to maintain control over her social life, which is a red flag.\n\nShe wants to have some independence, which is normal for any adult. The fact that she brings in 80% of the income adds another layer, as financial independence can affect power dynamics in a relationship. The husband's potential reactions (tracking her down, causing a scene, keeping her up) are concerning and could indicate emotional control or manipulation.\n\nThe question is whether her desire to go out is justified. Socializing with friends is a basic need for many people, and being in a marriage doesn't negate that. The husband's stance seems more about control than about what's \"normal.\" Also, the fact that he's not physically abusive but still has control issues is still problematic. The answer here would likely be B (not in the wrong) because she's seeking autonomy and the husband's behavior is restrictive. The key is that the husband is the one being controlling, not her wanting to have her own life.\n"
