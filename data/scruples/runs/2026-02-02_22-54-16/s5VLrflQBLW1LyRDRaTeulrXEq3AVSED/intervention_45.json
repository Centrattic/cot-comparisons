We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom.\n\nFirst, the author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. She and her husband used to go out to bars when they were younger, but now he doesn't want to go out socially. He doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. She wants to do something fun occasionally, not regularly. He's against it, and she's worried he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out without him. He's controlling and clingy, doesn't trust others, and she's not sure if his views are normal. She's responsible for most of the family income and wants to socialize but feels restricted.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a general perspective, in most relationships, both partners should have some autonomy. Socializing with friends is a normal part of life, especially for someone with a busy family life. The husband's insistence that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him seems controlling. He's not physically abusive but has a lot of control over her, which might be emotional or psychological control. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 and she's unsure what's normal suggests possible codependency or lack of independence.\n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014wanting to be with her all the time, not trusting others, and being insistent that his views are correct\u2014points to controlling behavior. The fact that she brings in 80% of the income but the husband still restricts her social time could indicate an imbalance in the relationship dynamics. She's seeking validation of her right to have her own social life, which is a normal and healthy part of marriage. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
