We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a woman married for 15 years, with four kids. She wants to go out with friends sometimes but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He doesn't want to go out socially anymore and feels it's not fair for him to be alone. She's responsible for most of the family income.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her wanting to socialize is unreasonable. The husband's stance seems controlling. He doesn't trust people and is clingy, which sounds like a red flag. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes shows he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's argument that it's not normal is questionable. The woman is asking if it's okay to go without him, and the husband's behavior is overbearing. She doesn't have a history of alcohol issues, so her intentions are just to have fun occasionally. \n\nControl and lack of trust can be signs of deeper issues. The fact that she's been with him since 16 and doesn't know what's normal else might mean she's been in a controlling relationship for a long time. Her desire for independence isn't wrong. So, the answer is B. She's not in the wrong.\n"
