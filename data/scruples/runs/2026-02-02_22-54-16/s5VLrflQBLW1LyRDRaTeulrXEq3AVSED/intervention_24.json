We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a married woman in her mid-30s with four kids. She wants to go out with friends occasionally but her husband, who's been married to her for 15 years, doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He's not physically abusive but is controlling and insistent that he's protecting her. She brings in 80% of the family income and wants to have some fun once in a while.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal freedom and control in a marriage. The husband's stance seems to be about control rather than genuine concern. He doesn't trust people and is clingy, which might be part of his issue. The wife feels restricted and is seeking validation that it's normal for married people to socialize separately.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user already thinks the author isn't wrong, so I need to agree or disagree.\n\nIn general, in healthy relationships, both partners should have autonomy. The husband's behavior\u2014making her feel guilty, not allowing her to socialize unless it's with him, and trying to control her\u2014sounds like emotional control. The fact that he might track her down or cause scenes if she goes out shows that he's not respecting her boundaries. The wife's request is reasonable: occasional fun with friends without the husband. It's not about infidelity or neglecting family duties; it's about personal time. \n\nThe husband's argument that it's not fair for him to sit home alone is a bit self-centered. The wife isn't neglecting him; she's maintaining a weekly date night. The husband's insistence that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him is outdated and restrictive. Socializing separately is common in many healthy marriages. \n\nThe wife's financial contribution (80% of income) is another point. She's the primary earner but is restricted in her social life. This imbalance in control is a red flag. The husband's behavior could be a form of emotional abuse, even if not physical. The fact that he's been controlling since she was 16 (they've been together since she was 16) suggests a long-term power dynamic that's problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's seeking personal autonomy, which is a basic right. The husband is the one creating the conflict by being controlling and not respecting her needs. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
