We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the married mom is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. \n\nFirst, the key points: They've been married 15 years, four kids, used to go out before. Now the husband doesn't want to go out socially and feels it's inappropriate for a married woman to go without him. The wife wants to do something fun occasionally. She brings in 80% of the income. The husband is controlling, doesn't trust others, can be clingy, and might cause a scene if she goes out. He's not physically abusive but exerts control. The wife isn't sure what's normal because her family isn't normal and she's been with him since 16.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about personal autonomy and what's considered normal in a marriage regarding socializing. The husband's stance is restrictive, maybe even controlling. The wife is seeking validation that her desire for some independence is normal. \n\nFrom a general perspective, it's reasonable for someone to want social time, especially as a parent. However, the husband's behavior\u2014controlling, not trusting, causing scenes\u2014suggests possible emotional manipulation or an overprotective nature. The wife's situation might indicate an imbalance in the relationship. \n\nBut the question is if she's in the wrong. The act of wanting to socialize isn't inherently wrong. The problem lies in the husband's reaction. If she's choosing to go out despite his protests, but does so in a respectful and responsible manner (like once in a while, not expecting weekly), she's not in the wrong. The husband's control and lack of trust are problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. Her desire for social time is valid, and the issue stems from the husband's controlling behavior.\n"
