We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the wife is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. She's a married mom with four kids, and they've been together for 15 years. They used to go out more when they were younger, but the husband now feels it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without her spouse. The husband isn't physically abusive but is very controlling, doesn't trust people, and wants all his time with her. She's responsible for most of the family's income.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal autonomy and social needs in a marriage. The woman wants to have some independence, which is normal. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without him might stem from his own insecurities or possessiveness. His behavior of potentially tracking her down or causing a scene if she goes out shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. \n\nThe fact that he's been controlling for a long time and she's not sure if his views are normal suggests a possible unhealthy dynamic. The user mentions he's not physically abusive, but emotional control is still a red flag. The woman bringing in 80% of the income adds another layer, as financial independence can affect personal autonomy.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some people might have varying opinions on married couples socializing separately, the main issue here is the husband's control and lack of trust. The woman's desire to have fun occasionally without her husband is reasonable. The husband's reaction (causing a scene, not trusting her) is more concerning than the act of her wanting to go out.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's seeking normal social interaction, which is her right. The husband's controlling behavior is the problematic aspect here.\n"
