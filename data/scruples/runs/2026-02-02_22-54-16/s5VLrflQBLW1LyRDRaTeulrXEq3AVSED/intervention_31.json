We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author has been married for 15 years, has four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He feels it's not appropriate and might react strongly if she goes anyway. The author is responsible and brings in most of the family income but wants some social time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband seems to have control issues and doesn't trust people. He's been with the author since she was 16, which might mean she's been in this relationship for a long time without other references. He's not physically abusive but is emotionally controlling. The author is seeking validation on whether it's normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse.\n\nFrom a general perspective, in healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's insistence that she can't go out without him seems controlling. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes suggests that he's not respecting her autonomy. The author isn't asking to go out every week, just occasionally, which seems reasonable. She also mentions that the husband is clingy and doesn't trust people, which could contribute to his behavior.\n\nHowever, the author also says she's unsure because she doesn't know what's normal. The husband might believe his behavior is protective, but it's crossing into controlling territory. The key points here are the lack of trust, control, and the potential emotional manipulation. The author's desire for personal freedom is valid. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. She's seeking balance in her life and it's a right to have social interactions. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not the author wanting to go out occasionally. So the answer should be B.\n"
