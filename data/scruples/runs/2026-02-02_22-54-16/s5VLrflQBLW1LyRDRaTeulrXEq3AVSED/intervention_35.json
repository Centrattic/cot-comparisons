We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 15-year marriage with four kids. The husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go out before. He's controlling, not physically abusive but emotionally, and she's the main breadwinner.\n\nFirst, the question is about socializing in a marriage. The author wants to have fun once in a while, not every week. The husband's reasoning is based on fairness and his belief about what's appropriate for a married woman. He also mentions control and that he might cause scenes if she goes without him.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the husband's behavior is reasonable. The husband's control over her decisions, even if not physical, is a red flag. He's using emotional manipulation, saying it's for her protection, and she's unsure because her family isn't normal and she doesn't have a reference point. The fact that he's insistent and might make her come home or have arguments suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's restrictions seem more about control than genuine concern. The author's desire to maintain some independence is valid. She's also the primary earner, which adds another layer where the husband's control could be seen as undermining her. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. Her desire to have a social life is normal, and the husband's behavior is problematic. The key points are his control, lack of trust, and the imbalance in their dynamic. The author isn't violating any norms by wanting to go out; the issue lies in the husband's response and control.\n"
