We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that she's been married for 15 years, has four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He feels it's not appropriate and might cause issues if she goes. She's responsible, brings in most of the income, and just wants some fun once in a while.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is controlling and doesn't trust people. He's been insistent since she was 16, and she's unsure if his views are normal. The question is about socializing without the spouse. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have autonomy. The husband's control seems to cross into an issue. He's making decisions for her, not respecting her need for social time. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control and lack of trust can be problematic. The author isn't asking to go out every week, just occasionally. That's reasonable. \n\nThe husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone might be his way of controlling her. Also, the fact that he might cause a scene or keep her up if she goes suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. She's seeking validation on what's normal, which is a good sign she's aware of the issue. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for people in relationships to have friends and some independence. The husband's stance seems restrictive. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life. So the answer should be B.\n"
