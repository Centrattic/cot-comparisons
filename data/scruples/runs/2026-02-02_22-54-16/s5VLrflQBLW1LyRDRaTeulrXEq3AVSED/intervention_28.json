We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they both don't have alcohol issues. He's been like this for ten years, and he gets insistent, maybe controlling. He takes her on a weekly dinner date but doesn't want her to go out with friends. She's the main breadwinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He doesn't trust people, is clingy, and wants to control her social interactions. Even if he's not physically abusive, emotional control is a red flag. The author mentions he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out, which suggests his behavior could be overbearing.\n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. In most relationships, both partners should have autonomy. Socializing with friends is a normal part of life, and a healthy relationship allows for individual social needs. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him seems restrictive. His controlling behavior might be a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nThe author is seeking validation on what's normal. In many cultures, it's considered normal for married individuals to have friends and social lives outside the marriage. The husband's insistence on controlling her social interactions might be an issue. Also, the fact that the author comes from a non-normal family and has been with him since 16 might have influenced her perception of what's normal. She might need external validation.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the problem here. She's reasonable in wanting to maintain her own social life, which is important for her well-being. Therefore, the correct choice should be B.\n"
