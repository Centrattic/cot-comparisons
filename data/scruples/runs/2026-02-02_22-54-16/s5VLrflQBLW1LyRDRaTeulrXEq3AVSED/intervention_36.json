We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a married mom who wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband is against it, even though he's not an alcoholic and they used to go out together. The husband is being very controlling and doesn't trust people, which makes the author question if he's right. She's responsible and brings in most of the income.\n\nFirst, I need to assess what is considered normal in a marriage regarding socializing without a spouse. The author wants to have some fun and social time, which is a reasonable desire. The husband's reasoning seems to stem from his own insecurities or control issues. He's been with her since she was 16, so maybe he's overprotective. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out despite his protests is a red flag. It sounds like he's being overly insistent and not respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should support each other's individual needs and social lives. The husband's behavior is not typical of a healthy marriage. He's not physically abusive, but the control and lack of trust are signs of potential emotional issues. The author deserves to have her own social time, especially since she's a parent and might need that to maintain her well-being. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect, individual autonomy, and the husband's controlling tendencies. The author isn't doing anything unreasonable by wanting to go out occasionally. The husband's insistence on his version of \"normal\" without considering her needs is the issue. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
