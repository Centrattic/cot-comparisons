We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. They used to go to the bar regularly when younger, but the husband hasn't wanted to socialize in the past ten years. He doesn't like her going out without him, even though he's not an alcoholic and they have weekly dinner dates. He's insistent it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to do this. He controls her and doesn't trust people, being clingy. The author isn't sure if he's right because she doesn't have a normal family background and has been with him since 16, so she doesn't know what else to compare.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points here are the husband's control over the author's social life, his insistence on her not going out without him, and the author's desire to have some fun and socialize. The husband's reasoning centers around what's \"normal\" and \"protecting\" her, but his behavior seems controlling. The author is a responsible parent and provider, contributing most of the income. She's not asking to go out frequently, just occasionally. The husband's potential reaction\u2014tracking her down, causing a scene, keeping her up\u2014is extreme and indicates a lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of what's normal in a marriage, it's common for individuals to have their own social lives. The husband's belief that a married woman shouldn't go out without her spouse is problematic. Control over a partner's activities, especially when it leads to extreme reactions, is a red flag in relationships. The author isn't doing anything harmful; she's seeking personal fulfillment and social interaction, which are important for mental health. The fact that the husband is clingy and doesn't trust people adds to the issue, as it suggests insecurity or jealousy. The author's uncertainty stems from her upbringing and long-term relationship, but that doesn't mean her needs are wrong. The answer likely leans towards B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a normal social life. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not her desire to go out.\n"
