We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite being a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to bars together. He feels it's not appropriate and has some control issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband is not physically abusive but is very controlling, doesn't trust people, and can be insistent. The author brings in 80%+ of the family income, which is significant. She wants to have some independence and socialize, which is a common need for many people. The husband's reasoning is that he doesn't want to be alone and thinks it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him. They've been together since she was 16, so maybe she hasn't had a lot of experience with independence or other relationships to compare.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From a general perspective on relationships, it's important for individuals to have their own social lives and personal freedom. A healthy marriage should allow both partners to maintain their individuality. The husband's behavior sounds controlling and possibly possessive, which can be a red flag. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out suggests that he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nHowever, the author does mention that the husband spends time with her and takes her on dates. Maybe he's trying to maintain the relationship in his own way, but his methods are restrictive. The user is asking if wanting to go out occasionally is unreasonable. Since the author is asking for input on what's normal, the community might consider that it's normal for people to have friends and socialize independently. \n\nThe husband's insistence on being right and his lack of trust could indicate deeper issues in the relationship. The author might be in a situation where she's losing her autonomy, which is a concern. The fact that she's unsure because her family background isn't normal and she doesn't have a frame of reference makes her vulnerable to his control. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not doing anything inherently wrong by wanting to spend time with friends. It's a basic social need. The husband's behavior is more problematic because he's restricting her freedom without valid reasons beyond his own discomfort. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong; the husband's behavior is the issue here.\n"
