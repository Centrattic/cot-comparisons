We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a married woman with four kids, asking if she's in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go out before. He's controlling, insists on spending time with her, and doesn't trust others. The key points here are her autonomy, the husband's control issues, and what's considered normal in a marriage regarding socializing.\n\nFirst, the husband's behavior seems possessive. He's not physically abusive but is very insistent and controlling. He claims it's about protecting her, but his actions\u2014like tracking her down, causing a scene, or keeping her up\u2014indicate he doesn't respect her independence. The fact that she brings in 80% of the income adds another layer; financial independence often correlates with personal autonomy, yet he's trying to control her social life.\n\nThe user mentions she doesn't come from a normal family and has been with her husband since she was 16, which might have limited her understanding of healthy relationships. The husband's reasoning that it's unfair for him to be alone is a common manipulation tactic. A healthy relationship should allow both partners to have their own social lives.\n\nSocializing without a spouse is generally considered normal and healthy. It allows individuals to maintain their own identities and social networks. The husband's unwillingness to let her go out, even occasionally, suggests a lack of trust and emotional control. The user isn't asking to go out frequently\u2014just once in a while\u2014which is reasonable.\n\nThe husband's clinginess and distrust could be signs of deeper issues, possibly insecurity or possessiveness. However, that doesn't justify controlling behavior. The user's desire for independence is valid. She's not in the wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life as a married person. The problem lies in the husband's reaction and control, not her desire to socialize.\n"
