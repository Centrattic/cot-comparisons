We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (a married mom) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially, feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go without him, and might cause issues if she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman is 34, married for 15 years, has four kids. They used to go out before, but now the husband doesn't want to. The husband is controlling, doesn't trust people, is clingy, and has a lot of control. The woman brings in 80% of the income, which might indicate some imbalance in their relationship.\n\nThe key points are the husband's control and his insistence that she shouldn't go out without him. This could be a sign of emotional control or even emotional abuse. The woman wants autonomy, which is a basic need. The husband's reasoning about it not being fair for him to be alone and his belief about societal norms might stem from his own insecurities or lack of trust. However, controlling behavior isn't justified under any circumstances. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes shows he's not respecting her autonomy. The woman's background of not having a normal family and being with him since 16 might have made her more susceptible to his influence. She's seeking validation on what's normal, which is a red flag if her husband is dictating her social life. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have independence. The husband's behavior seems to be about control, not just about socializing. The woman isn't wrong for wanting to maintain her social life and independence. The husband's actions could be considered emotionally abusive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the issue lies with the husband's controlling behavior.\n"
