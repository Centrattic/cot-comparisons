We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman who's married for 15 years with four kids. She wants to go out with friends sometimes, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go without him. He's not opposed to alcohol, but he's uncomfortable with her socializing alone. The key points here are about personal freedom versus control.\n\nFirst, the husband is controlling. He doesn't allow her to go out, even if she just wants to hang out with friends occasionally. The user mentions he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes against his wishes. That sounds like emotional control, maybe even emotional abuse. His reasoning about not being fair for him to be alone doesn't hold up because the woman has the right to her own social life. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's the primary breadwinner (80% of income) adds another layer. She's contributing significantly, so expecting her to be tied down to home duties without any personal time isn't fair. The husband's insistence on controlling her movements and decisions, even after 15 years, seems to stem from a place of possessiveness and lack of trust. \n\nThe user's uncertainty comes from growing up in an abnormal family and being with her husband since she was 16. That might have shaped her views on what's normal in a relationship, making her question her own needs. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong for wanting to socialize. From a general perspective, adults have the right to personal autonomy and social connections. The husband's behavior is more concerning here\u2014his control and lack of support for her needing some independence points to an unhealthy dynamic.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her desire for personal time is valid, and the husband's controlling behavior is the issue, not her wanting to go out.\n"
