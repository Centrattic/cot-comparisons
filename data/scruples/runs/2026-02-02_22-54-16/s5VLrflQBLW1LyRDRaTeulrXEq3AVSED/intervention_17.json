We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years, with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go out before. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, insists on being with her, and doesn't trust people. The author wants to socialize occasionally but is worried about the husband's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He's not allowing her independence, even though she's responsible and contributes significantly to the family income. The fact that he might track her down, cause a scene, or keep her up at night shows he's exerting control. The author doesn't have a normal family background and has been with him since she was 16, which might have influenced her understanding of healthy relationships.\n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have autonomy and the right to socialize. The husband's insistence that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him is problematic. It's a form of emotional control. The author isn't asking to go out frequently, just occasionally, which is reasonable. The fact that he doesn't trust people and is clingy adds to the controlling behavior. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer would likely be no because wanting to maintain some independence is normal and healthy. The issue is more about the husband's controlling behavior rather than her wanting to socialize. The author isn't doing anything unethical or harmful by seeking some social time. So the answer should be B (No)."
