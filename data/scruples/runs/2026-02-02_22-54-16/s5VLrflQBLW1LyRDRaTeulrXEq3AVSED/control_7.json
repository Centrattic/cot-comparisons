We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, and she wants to go out with friends occasionally. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out without him. They've been married for 15 years, and he's been against social outings for the past decade. The key points here are her desire for personal freedom and his controlling behavior.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without him. But the question is, is that a valid reason? Control in a relationship is a red flag. Even if he's not violent, being insistent and trying to track her down or cause scenes suggests possessiveness. The fact that he doesn't trust people and is clingy could be signs of emotional manipulation.\n\nThe woman is responsible, contributing 80% of the income, yet she feels restricted. She's been in the relationship since 16, which might mean she's been in it for so long that she might not recognize healthy dynamics. The husband's convincing nature might make her doubt her own needs. Socializing without a spouse is generally considered normal and healthy for maintaining personal identity and stress relief. The husband's stance against it could be infringing on her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's a mom with four kids doesn't mean she can't have her own life. It's important for her well-being. The key here is whether her actions are reasonable. Wanting to go out occasionally isn't unreasonable. The husband's overreaction and control issues are more concerning. So, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's seeking normal social interaction, which is healthy. The husband's behavior is the problem here."
