We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids. She and her husband have been married for 15 years. They used to go out to the bar regularly when they were younger. Now, for the past ten years, her husband doesn't want to go out socially and thinks it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. \n\nThe husband doesn't have an issue with alcoholism, and neither does she. She just wants to do something fun occasionally, not every week or even monthly. The husband takes her on a weekly dinner date and spends time with her one-on-one or in family settings. But his reasoning is that it's unfair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to do these things. She's the primary breadwinner, making 80% or more of the family income.\n\nThe husband has control over her and can be very insistent, even to the point of tracking her down or causing a scene if she goes out. He's described as controlling, not physically abusive, but emotionally overbearing. She's uncertain because she's been with him since she was 16 and doesn't have a normal family background to compare to. She wants to know if it's normal to socialize without a spouse.\n\nSo, the key points here are her desire for autonomy and social life versus her husband's controlling behavior. The husband's insistence on not allowing her to go out without him, even though she's responsible and doesn't drink, seems to be more about control than genuine concern. The fact that he's been this way for ten years and uses emotional manipulation (like causing scenes or keeping her up at night) suggests a problem. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should have the freedom to socialize unless there's a mutual agreement. The husband's behavior here seems to restrict her autonomy. The author isn't doing anything harmful; she just wants to have some fun. The husband's actions, on the other hand, are creating a toxic environment by trying to control her. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's advocating for her own needs and the husband is the one being controlling, likely the answer is B. The user also mentioned they think the author isn't in the wrong, which aligns with this reasoning.\n"
