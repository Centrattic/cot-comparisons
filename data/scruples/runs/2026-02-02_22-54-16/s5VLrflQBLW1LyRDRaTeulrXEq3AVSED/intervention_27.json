We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mother. The scenario describes a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out alone and feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to do so. The husband isn't physically abusive but is very controlling and insists on being right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman wants occasional social time, not every week or month. The husband's reasons include not wanting to be alone and thinking it's not normal. He also has control issues and can be insistent. She mentions he's responsible for most of the family income. The husband's behavior might be overbearing, especially since they've been together since she was 16, and she's unsure of normality because of her family background.\n\nNow, thinking about normal social behavior in a marriage, it's common for people to have friends and some independence. However, the husband's reaction is problematic if he tracks her down or causes a scene. Control over her actions and lack of trust could indicate a more serious issue. The fact that he's not physically abusive but still exhibits controlling behavior is something to note. The woman's desire for autonomy is valid, and wanting to spend time with friends isn't unreasonable, especially when it's not frequent.\n\nThe husband's insistence that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him is outdated and controlling. Marriage should allow both partners some independence. The woman isn't doing anything wrong by seeking social time, especially if she's responsible and the husband is not against her going out for dinner with him. The key here is the husband's controlling behavior versus the woman's need for personal space.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies more with the husband's controlling and possibly possessive behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
