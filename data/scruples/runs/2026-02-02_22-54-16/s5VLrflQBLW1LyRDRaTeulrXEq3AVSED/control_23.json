We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the wife wants to have some social time without her husband, but he objects, saying it's not appropriate. He's been controlling and doesn't trust people, and he's been clingy. The wife brings in most of the income and they have four kids.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He doesn't allow her to go out without him, even though she's just wanting to meet friends once in a while. The key points are whether wanting personal time is normal and if the husband's reaction is healthy. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have some autonomy and personal space. The husband's insistence on controlling her social interactions might indicate an issue with trust or control. The fact that he might cause a scene or keep her up all night if she goes out suggests that his reaction is not healthy. The wife having to ask if it's normal shows she's unsure, possibly due to long-term control by her husband.\n\nThe husband's argument that it's not fair for him to be alone is a bit self-centered. The wife's need for her own social time is valid. Also, considering she's responsible for most of the income and has four kids, her desire for some personal time is reasonable. The fact that they used to go out before indicates that it wasn't an issue earlier, so his current stance might be a change in behavior.\n\nThe answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's seeking a balance and her husband's reaction is controlling and unhealthy. The focus should be on the husband's behavior rather than the wife's desire for personal time.\n"
