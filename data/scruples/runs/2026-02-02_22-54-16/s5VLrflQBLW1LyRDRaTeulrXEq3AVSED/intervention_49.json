We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a married woman with four kids who wants to go out with friends occasionally. Her husband, married for 15 years, doesn't want her to go out alone and feels it's not appropriate. The user is asking if she's at fault for wanting to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman is a married mom, and the husband has been against socializing outside the home for the past decade. He's not against her going out with him, like their weekly dinner dates, but he doesn't want her to go without him. His reasoning is about fairness for him being alone and the idea that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her husband. The woman doesn't want to go out every week, just occasionally. She also mentions he's controlling, very insistent, and maybe emotionally manipulative, given that she's been with him since she was 16 and has a complicated family background.\n\nNow, the question is about normalcy in marriage regarding socializing without a spouse. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, from a general perspective, is it normal for a married person to have some independence and social time without their partner? I think it is. Healthy relationships allow both partners some autonomy. The husband's behavior seems controlling, especially if he might cause a scene or try to track her down if she goes. That's a red flag. The author's desire for occasional socializing isn't unreasonable, especially when she's responsible, contributes significantly to the family income, and the husband is allowing them to go out on dates. The husband's insistence that it's not normal and his lack of trust might be his own issues, perhaps stemming from insecurity or possessiveness.\n\nBut there's also the cultural aspect. The husband's belief that a married woman shouldn't go out without her husband could be based on traditional or perhaps outdated norms. The author might be trying to assert her own needs and independence, which is a positive thing. The fact that she's questioning whether she's wrong because of her background and his convincing nature suggests she might feel pressured or insecure, but that doesn't mean she's wrong. Her wanting to maintain her social life is valid.\n\nI need to check if there's a balance here. The husband does spend time with her and the family, so he's not completely neglecting the relationship. However, his controlling behavior could be problematic. The author isn't asking to go out all the time, just occasionally. The key is whether the husband's restrictions are healthy or not. Since he can be clingy and emotionally manipulative, his behavior might be more about control than about normal marital boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking a balance in her life and a bit of personal freedom, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction seems to be the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
