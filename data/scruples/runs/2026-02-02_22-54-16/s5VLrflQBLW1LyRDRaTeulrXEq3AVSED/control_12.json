We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author is a married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. She wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He's insistent, controlling, and doesn't trust people. She's bringing in 80% of the family income.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if wanting to have some social time without the spouse is unreasonable. Socializing is a normal part of adult life, so wanting to go out with friends isn't inherently wrong. The husband's reaction seems controlling and restrictive. He's not being physically abusive, but his behavior includes possible emotional control, like causing a scene or keeping her up discussing it. That sounds like emotional manipulation.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and boundaries. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have some independence. The husband's control over her social life might be a red flag. The fact that she's unsure because of her background and his convincing nature is important. She's been with him since she was 16, so maybe her perception of normal is skewed. \n\nThe husband's reasons for not wanting her to go out are based on his own insecurities or beliefs, not on her well-being. The author isn't asking to go out all the time, just occasionally. The husband's reaction if she does go suggests that he's not respecting her autonomy and is trying to exert control.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The husband's behavior is the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
