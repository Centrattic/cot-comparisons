We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a married woman in her 30s with four kids, married for 15 years. They used to go out to the bar when they were younger, but now her husband doesn't want to go out socially. The husband thinks it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The wife wants to go out with friends occasionally, maybe once a month, but not every week. The husband takes her out on a weekly dinner date and spends time with her, but he's insistent about her not going out without him. He might track her down or cause a scene if she does. He's not physically abusive but has control issues and is clingy. The wife is unsure because she doesn't have a normal family background and has been with him since she was 16, so she doesn't know what's normal.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The husband is restricting her social life, which is a form of control. He's insistent she not go out without him, even though she's responsible and brings in most of the income. The wife wants some independence. The husband's behavior might be overstepping, especially if he's causing a scene or not respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone doesn't justify controlling her. The wife's desire for occasional fun without her spouse is reasonable. Also, the husband's lack of trust and clinginess might indicate an issue with control or jealousy. The fact that he might track her down or make her come home suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe wife's background of being with him since 16 and not having a normal family might contribute to her feeling unsure, but that doesn't mean her needs are invalid. Socializing is a normal part of adult life, and the husband's insistence that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him is a traditional view that doesn't align with modern understandings of personal freedom in relationships. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more concerning. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
