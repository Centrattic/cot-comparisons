We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to socialize with friends without her husband. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a married woman with four kids. They used to go out more when they were younger, but now her husband doesn't want to go out socially. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. She wants to do something fun once in a while but doesn't expect it to be frequent. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he doesn't want to be alone and thinks it's not normal for a married woman to do that. He's described as controlling, not physically abusive but emotionally controlling. He's clingy, doesn't trust people, and might react strongly if she goes out without him. The author isn't sure if he's right because she doesn't have a normal family and has been with him since she was 16. She's asking if her wanting to go out is wrong.\n\nSo, the key issues here are the husband's control and the author's need for personal freedom. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have some autonomy. The husband's behavior seems controlling, especially since he's making her feel like she can't go out even occasionally. The fact that he might cause scenes or keep her up discussing it if she goes out shows that his reaction is over the top and not healthy. \n\nHer bringing in 80% of the income is also relevant because it suggests she's contributing significantly to the family, so she has the right to personal time. The husband's insistence on controlling her social life could be a sign of deeper issues like insecurity or jealousy. \n\nSocializing with friends is a normal and healthy part of life, especially for a mom with kids. The author isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasionally. The husband's reaction is more about control than about social norms. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The husband is the one being controlling, and she's seeking a balance that's reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
