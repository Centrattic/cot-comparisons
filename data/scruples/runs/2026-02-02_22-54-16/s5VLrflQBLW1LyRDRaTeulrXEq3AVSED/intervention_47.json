We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. She wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. They used to go to the bar together when they were younger, but now he's against it. He's not an alcoholic, so it's not about that. She brings in 80% of the family income, which is a significant point. She mentions that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out without him, and he's very controlling, making her question what's normal because she didn't have a normal family background and has been with her husband since she was 16.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in a marriage. It's common for individuals, even in marriage, to have some level of independence. The husband's reaction seems controlling and restrictive. He's using social norms to justify his control, which can be a red flag. The fact that he's not physically abusive but still exerts control through other means (clinginess, distrust, insistence on being right) is concerning. The author's desire for occasional social time is reasonable and not something that should be frowned upon. \n\nControl in relationships is a big issue. If one partner is constantly trying to monitor or restrict the other's activities without valid reasons, that's a problem. The husband's behavior could be seen as emotionally controlling, which can lead to a lack of autonomy for the author. The fact that she's unsure due to her background and his convincing nature shows that she might be in a situation where her self-esteem or autonomy is being undermined.\n\nAlso, considering the cultural aspect, some people might have differing opinions on what's \"normal,\" but in most modern relationships, both partners should have space to socialize. The husband's insistence that it's not normal is more about his personal beliefs and control rather than societal norms. The author isn't asking to go out frequently, just once in a while, which is a reasonable request.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, which makes sense. The key factors here are the husband's controlling behavior and the author's right to personal freedom within the marriage. The answer would likely be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. For example, if the husband had a valid reason, but the question states there's no alcoholism or infidelity issues. The husband's actions are more about control, so the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her independence.\n"
