We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a married woman wanting to spend time with her friends, but her husband is against it, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. They have four kids, and she works more than 80% of the family income. The husband is described as controlling, insistent, and not physically abusive but emotionally manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author wants to have some personal time and socialize, which is a normal need for many adults. The husband's objections are based on his beliefs about appropriateness and fairness, but his behavior is controlling. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out is concerning. The author is in a long-term relationship where she's been with him since 16, which might have led to a lack of comparison in what's normal.\n\nThe main issue here is about personal autonomy and healthy boundaries in a marriage. The husband's stance seems to be about control rather than just social norms. The author is asking for validation on whether her desire to socialize is normal. Generally, in a healthy relationship, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's behavior, especially the potential to cause a scene or track her, indicates possible emotional control issues.\n\nI should consider cultural or personal beliefs, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The husband's insistence on controlling her actions, despite her being the primary breadwinner, points to an imbalance. The author isn't doing anything harmful by wanting to socialize, and the husband's reaction is the problem. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
