We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a married woman with four kids. She wants to go out with friends occasionally but her husband is against it. He doesn't want her to go out without him, citing cultural norms and his possessiveness. He's not abusive but very controlling. She's responsible for most of the family income.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to have social time without her husband. From a modern perspective, personal autonomy and social needs are important in a relationship. The husband's stance seems restrictive and controlling. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 might mean she hasn't developed a sense of independence. But the key points are her right to socialize and the husband's over-control. \n\nThe husband's reasoning about fairness and normalcy is subjective. Socializing with friends without a spouse is common. The husband's behavior\u2014threatening to cause a scene or keep her up\u2014indicates control issues. The author isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasional. She's contributing financially, which adds to her argument that she should have autonomy.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
