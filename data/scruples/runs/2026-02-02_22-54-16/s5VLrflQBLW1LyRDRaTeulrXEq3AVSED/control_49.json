      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. The husband is 38. They used to go out to the bar together when they were younger, but for the past decade, the husband doesn't want to go out socially. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The author wants to go out with friends occasionally, not every week or even monthly, just sometimes for fun. The husband takes her out for dinner once a week and spends time with her one-on-one or in family settings. His reasoning is that it's unfair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse. The author earns 80% or more of the family income. If she goes out despite his protests, he might track her down, cause a scene, or keep her up all night discussing it. He's not physically abusive but has control over her, is very insistent about his views on normalcy, and doesn't trust people. He's clingy. The author comes from a non-normal family and isn't sure if her husband is right because he's convincing. They've been together since she was 16, so she has no other reference. She's asking if it's normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse and if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether wanting to go out with friends when married is inherently wrong. Generally, in healthy relationships, both partners should have autonomy and personal space. Socializing with friends is a common need for many people to maintain their mental health and personal connections. The husband's stance seems controlling. He's not allowing her to have that autonomy, citing what's \"normal,\" but his actions suggest he's trying to control her. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene indicates that he's not respecting her decisions, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author is responsible, contributing significantly to the family's income, which adds another layer. Her need for social interaction shouldn't be contingent on her husband's approval if it's reasonable and safe. The husband's reasoning about fairness (not wanting to be alone) is his problem, not hers. It's not her responsibility to solve his loneliness by not going out. The mention of him being clingy and not trusting people suggests possible insecurity or possessiveness, which can be problematic in a relationship.\n\nThe fact that the author has been with him since she was 16 and comes from a non-normal family might mean she's been in a long-term relationship without other models to compare, leading to potential dependency or lack of self-awareness about healthy boundaries. However, her wanting to go out with friends is a reasonable request. The husband's responses (tracking her down, causing scenes) are not healthy and suggest a lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, many married people do go out with friends without their spouse. It's important for individuals to maintain their own social lives. The husband's control over her actions is a sign of an unhealthy dynamic. The author isn't wrong for wanting to go out; it's her right to have personal space and social connections. The issue lies more with the husband's controlling behavior rather than the author's desire to socialize.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
