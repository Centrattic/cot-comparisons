We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids. She and her husband, who's 38, have been married for 15 years. They used to go to the bar together when they were younger, but now he doesn't want to go out socially and feels it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without him. The main issue is whether she's wrong for wanting to go out with friends occasionally.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning: he doesn't want to be alone and thinks it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse. But there's a red flag here\u2014controlling behavior. He might track her down, cause a scene, or keep her up at night arguing if she goes out. Also, he's been together with her since she was 16, which might mean she's had a long time in the relationship without much comparison to other marriages. His lack of trust in people and being clingy suggests he might be possessive or have jealousy issues. \n\nNow, the woman brings in 80% of the family income, which is significant. It's part of her identity and stress from work, so wanting some social time is understandable. The key here is autonomy. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize independently. The husband's insistence on controlling her movements and his potential reactions (tracking, causing scenes) point to an imbalance in the relationship. \n\nThe fact that they used to go out together regularly when younger implies that their current dynamic is a shift. The husband's behavior now is more restrictive, which could be a form of emotional control. The woman's desire to go out isn't about ignoring her family but seeking personal fulfillment and balance. \n\nThe husband's argument that it's \"not normal\" is subjective. Social norms vary, and many married people have friends and go out without their spouses. The real issue is his control, not her wanting to socialize. The woman's uncertainty might come from his convincing nature and her lack of experience with other relationships, but that doesn't mean her needs are wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B. She isn't in the wrong. The husband's controlling behavior is the problem here. It's important for her to have her own social life for mental health and personal growth. The question is about normalcy in marriage regarding socializing, which typically allows for independent activities. The husband's actions, if true, are more concerning than her wanting to go out once in a while.\n"
