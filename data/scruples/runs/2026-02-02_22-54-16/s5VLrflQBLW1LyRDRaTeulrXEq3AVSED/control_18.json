We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband.

He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. Her husband is 38. They used to go out to the bar regularly when they were younger, but for the past ten years, the husband doesn't want to go out socially. He believes it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The author just wants to go out with friends occasionally, not every week or even monthly, just something fun once in a while. The husband takes her on a weekly dinner date and wants to spend time with her either one-on-one or with the family.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that it's unfair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to do such things. The author brings in 80% or more of the family income. If she goes out despite his protests, he might track her down, make her come home, cause a scene, or keep her up all night discussing it. He's not physically abusive but has a lot of control and can be insistent. He's also distrustful and clingy. The author comes from an abnormal family and has been with her husband since she was 16, so she's unsure if her husband is right. She's asking if she's in the wrong for wanting to socialize without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether it's normal for a married person to go out with friends without their spouse. From a general standpoint, in many cultures, it's considered normal for married individuals to have their own social lives. However, this depends on mutual respect and communication. The key points here are the husband's controlling behavior and lack of trust, which might indicate issues beyond just differing opinions on socializing.\n\nThe husband's behavior of potentially tracking her down, causing a scene, or keeping her up all night suggests that he's not respecting her autonomy. Healthy relationships allow both partners to have their own social circles. The fact that he's been controlling for ten years and she's been with him since 16 might mean she's in an emotionally controlling relationship. The husband's insistence that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without him could be a way of exerting control, especially since she's the primary breadwinner. \n\nThe author's desire to have some independence is valid. The husband's reaction indicates he might be struggling with insecurity or jealousy, which is a problem for him to address, not her to accommodate. The fact that they used to go out together and he stopped suggests a change in his behavior over time, which might be linked to his need for control. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her social life. The issue lies with the husband's controlling behavior and lack of respect for her autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
