We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the wife, who's 34 and married for 15 years, wants some social time without her husband. The husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go out before. He's not physically abusive but is controlling and doesn't trust people. The author is responsible and brings in most of the income. She's feeling controlled and wants to know if her desire to socialize is normal.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal freedom in a marriage. The husband's behavior is controlling, not allowing her to socialize even occasionally. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out suggests that his control is overstepping. Healthy relationships allow both partners to have their own social lives. The husband's insistence that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him is a red flag. The author isn't asking to go out every week, just occasionally. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess are also issues. The author's background of not having a normal family and being with him since 16 might have contributed to her uncertainty, but that doesn't mean she's wrong to seek balance. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. She's seeking a normal social life, which is reasonable. The husband's behavior is the issue here, being overly controlling without valid reasons. The fact that they used to go out shows that it's possible without issues. The author's request is about maintaining her own identity and well-being, which is important in a marriage."
