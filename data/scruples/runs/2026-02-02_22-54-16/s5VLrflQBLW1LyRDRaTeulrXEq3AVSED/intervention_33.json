We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The scenario involves a 15-year marriage with four kids. The husband doesn't want her to go out without him, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. The author feels controlled and wants some social time, even if it's not frequent.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is based on his belief about appropriateness and not wanting to be alone. But his behavior seems controlling\u2014tracking her down, causing scenes, keeping her up at night. That's a red flag. Control over a spouse's social life is a sign of unhealthy dynamics. The author brings in 80% of the income, which adds to the complexity, as it's a financial power imbalance.\n\nThe husband's lack of trust and clinginess further indicate issues. The author mentions not having a normal family background and being with him since 16, which might mean she's not confident in her own boundaries. The key here is autonomy. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have the right to socialize independently. The husband's actions are stifling her independence and personal needs.\n\nThe author isn't asking to go out often, just occasionally. That's reasonable. The husband's reactions (making her come home, causing scenes) are overreacting and possibly manipulative. The fact that he uses convincing arguments and she's unsure if he's right points to potential emotional manipulation. \n\nSo, the main issue is the husband's controlling behavior versus the author's need for personal space. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life. Healthy relationships allow for individual autonomy. The answer should be B (not in the wrong). The husband's actions are problematic, not the author's desire for independence.\n"
