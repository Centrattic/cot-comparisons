We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they have a good financial situation and he's not physically abusive. He's controlling and insistent that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her husband. The author brings in 80% of the income and has four kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He's not physically abusive but is emotionally controlling, maybe even possessive. The author wants some independence and social time, which is reasonable. The question is whether wanting that makes her the one in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for individuals in a marriage to have their own social lives. The husband's belief that it's inappropriate is more restrictive. Also, the fact that he's been controlling since they were 16 and she doesn't know what's normal because of her own family background complicates things. She might be in an emotionally abusive situation where her autonomy is being limited.\n\nThe husband's actions\u2014tracking her down, causing a scene, keeping her up all night\u2014suggest he's trying to control her, which is a red flag. The author's desire for some independence and to spend time with friends is valid. Even though he's trying to protect her, his overprotectiveness is stifling her.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. Her wanting to go out is reasonable, and the husband's controlling behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
