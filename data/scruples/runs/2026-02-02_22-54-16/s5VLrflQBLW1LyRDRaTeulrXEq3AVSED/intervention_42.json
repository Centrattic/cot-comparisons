We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the woman is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that she's been married for 15 years, has four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. They used to go out before, but now he feels it's not appropriate. She brings in 80% of the income and just wants some fun once in a while. The husband is controlling, doesn't trust people, and might cause a scene if she goes without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. Generally, people should have some independence unless there are specific reasons like safety concerns or cultural norms. However, the husband's behavior here seems controlling. He doesn't trust her, is clingy, and might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out. That sounds like emotional control, which isn't healthy. \n\nThe fact that he's been this way for a long time and she's been with him since she was 16 might mean she hasn't had much experience in other relationships. His insistence that it's normal and his convincing ways could be manipulating her into thinking she's wrong for wanting independence. \n\nAlso, she's a working parent, contributing significantly to the family income. It's reasonable for her to want some personal time. The husband's jealousy and lack of trust could be creating an unhealthy dynamic. The key points here are the controlling behavior and the lack of mutual respect for her need for social interaction. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should support each other's social needs. The husband's reaction\u2014potentially causing a scene or keeping her up all night\u2014indicates he's not respecting her autonomy. So, the woman isn't in the wrong. She's seeking balance and normal social interaction, which is a valid need. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
