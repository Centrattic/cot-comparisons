We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years, with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go out before. He's not into socializing now and feels it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The author wants to have some fun once in a while, not regularly. The husband is controlling, maybe a bit clingy, and not trusting. He might cause a scene if she goes out. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He's restricting her social life, which could be a sign of emotional control. The key points are his insistence on being with her all the time, not allowing her to socialize, and possibly making her feel guilty. The author is trying to maintain her independence, which is normal for any adult. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have some personal space and social interactions. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone is a bit of a red herring. His jealousy or insecurity shouldn't limit her autonomy. The fact that he's been controlling since they were teenagers and she doesn't know other relationships might mean she's used to this dynamic but is now realizing it's not healthy.\n\nThe author isn't asking for something unreasonable\u2014just occasional outings with friends. The husband's potential reactions (tracking her down, causing a scene) indicate emotional manipulation or control. The author's responsibility in providing income might also be a factor, but that's separate from her right to personal time.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's seeking normal social interaction, and the husband's behavior is controlling and unhealthy. The question is about societal norms regarding socializing without a spouse, and generally, it's acceptable. The husband's issues are his own, not the author's fault.\n"
