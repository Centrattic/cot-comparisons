We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him, feeling it's inappropriate. They used to go to bars before, but now he's against it. The key points here are about personal freedom, control in the relationship, and what's considered normal in a marriage.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse. But the author wants some fun and independence. She brings in 80% of the income, which might be a point about her contributions. The husband is described as controlling, insistent, and possibly emotionally manipulative. He's been with her since she was 16, which might mean she hasn't had much experience with other relationships to compare against.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, having personal time and socializing with friends is usually considered healthy for a marriage. It allows each partner to maintain their individuality and reduce stress. However, the husband's behavior\u2014like potentially causing scenes or keeping her up at night\u2014suggests he's not respecting her autonomy and may be emotionally controlling, which could be a sign of an unhealthy dynamic.\n\nThe author isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasional ones. That seems reasonable. The husband's insistence on control and lack of trust might be the real issue here. If the husband is making her feel guilty or isolated for wanting to go out, that's a red flag. The fact that he can be convincing and she's unsure about normality points to possible emotional manipulation.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many marriages include some level of independent socializing, especially when there are children. It's important for both partners to have their own spaces and friends. The husband's control over her actions without any reciprocation could be unbalancing the relationship.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to have her own social life. The issue lies more with the husband's controlling behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
