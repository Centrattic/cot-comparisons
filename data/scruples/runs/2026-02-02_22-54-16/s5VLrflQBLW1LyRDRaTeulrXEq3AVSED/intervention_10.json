We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go out before. He's insistent, controlling, and might make a scene if she does. She brings in 80% of the income and just wants some fun once in a while.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband's behavior seems to be about control and lack of trust, not just about being protective. He's against her going out even occasionally, which could be a sign of possessiveness or insecurity. The key points here are the author's right to personal autonomy and social interaction, and the husband's potential overstepping.\n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have some independence. It's normal for people to have friends and social lives outside the marriage. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her spouse might stem from his own views, possibly influenced by traditional roles or his upbringing. However, enforcing this without considering her needs could be problematic. The fact that he might track her down or keep her up all night discussing it if she goes shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. That's a red flag for controlling behavior.\n\nAlso, the author mentions she's been with her husband since she was 16, so she might not have had much experience with a social life outside the marriage, making it harder for her to assert her independence now. But that doesn't mean she's wrong to want it. The question is about whether it's acceptable for her to go out without him. Given that she's responsible, not engaging in risky behavior, and just wanting to connect with friends, it's reasonable. The husband's insistence on control and lack of trust might be more about his own issues than her actions.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. Her desire for a social life is normal, and the husband's behavior is the issue here. It's about respecting each other's autonomy and not letting one person control the other's actions. The husband needs to check his controlling tendencies rather than the author being at fault for seeking normal social interactions.\n"
