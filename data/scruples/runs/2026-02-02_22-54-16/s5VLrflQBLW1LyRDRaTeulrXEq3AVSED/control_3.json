We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman is married for 15 years, has four kids, and wants to go out occasionally. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they were bar regulars when younger. The husband is controlling, doesn't trust others, and might cause a scene if she goes. She brings in 80% of the income and feels controlled. \n\nNow, considering what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. Generally, people should have some autonomy. The husband's behavior seems controlling and restrictive. He's not abusive physically but is clingy and insists on his own views of normalcy. The woman wants a little independence and fun.\n\nThe key points here are her desire for personal freedom and the husband's controlling behavior. The husband's reasoning that it's unfair for him to be alone might not justify controlling her actions. Also, she's responsible and contributes financially, which adds to the argument that she should have the right to socialize.\n\nIn most relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize unless there's a specific reason (like a closed relationship). The husband's insistence on controlling her movements could be seen as unhealthy. The fact that he might cause a scene or disrupt her when she goes shows a lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go out. The husband's behavior is the issue here. So the answer should be B (no).\n"
