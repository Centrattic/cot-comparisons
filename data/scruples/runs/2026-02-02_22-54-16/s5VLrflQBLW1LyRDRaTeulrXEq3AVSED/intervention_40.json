We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite being married. The author is a married mom with four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to go out without him. They used to go out before, but now he feels it's not appropriate. The husband controls things a lot, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. The author brings in most of the income and just wants some social time. She's unsure if her husband is right because of her upbringing and his convincing nature.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points are her right to socialize versus his control. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have autonomy. The husband's behavior sounds controlling and possibly possessive. He's not abusive physically but uses emotional control and insists on being right. The author wants to spend time with friends occasionally, which is common for many people. The fact that he might track her down or cause scenes if she goes shows his lack of respect for her independence. \n\nThe question is about societal norms. The author is asking if it's normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse. From a modern perspective, yes, it is normal and healthy to have personal time and social interactions. The husband's argument against it seems outdated and restrictive. The author's request isn't excessive\u2014just once in a while. The husband's control over her decisions, especially without valid reasons, is problematic. \n\nConsidering these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking a balance between family life and personal needs. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not her desire to go out. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
