We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the woman (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: She's been married for 15 years, has four kids, and wants some social time without her husband. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, saying it's not appropriate. He's not abusive but is very controlling, possibly clingy, and doesn't trust people. The woman brings in 80% of the family income, which adds to the dynamic. She's been with him since she was 16, which might affect her perception of what's normal.\n\nNow, the key points here. The husband's stance is that a married woman shouldn't socialize without her spouse. That's a traditional view, but personal autonomy is important. The woman is seeking normal social interaction, which is a basic need. The husband's behavior sounds controlling\u2014tracking her down, causing scenes, keeping her up. Even if he's not physically abusive, emotional control is a red flag.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The answer hinges on societal norms versus individual rights. In modern relationships, both partners should have autonomy unless there's a mutual agreement. The husband's insistence without considering her needs is problematic. Also, his distrust and control over her actions aren't healthy in a balanced marriage. The woman is asking for input because she's unsure, maybe due to his convincing nature and her lack of other references. \n\nShe's not going out weekly or monthly, just occasionally. The husband's reaction (tracking her, causing scenes) suggests he's not respecting her boundaries. The fact that she's the primary breadwinner adds another layer; it's about mutual respect regardless of financial roles. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The woman isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the issue here. She's seeking normalcy, and his control is the problem. The key is that in a healthy marriage, both partners should have the right to socialize unless they mutually agree otherwise. Since he's not allowing her autonomy and is being controlling, she's justified in wanting to go out.\n"
