We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a married woman with four kids, asking if she's in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though he takes her on weekly dinner dates. He's controlling, insists he's protecting her, and she's unsure if his behavior is normal.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her wanting to socialize is unreasonable. She mentions she doesn't want to go out every week, just occasionally. That seems reasonable. The husband's reasoning is about fairness and societal norms, but he's controlling her actions. He also mentions tracking her down or causing scenes if she goes out, which indicates he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy in marriage, boundaries, and controlling behavior. In healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize unless there's a mutual agreement. The husband's behavior sounds possessive and lacks trust. The fact that he's been controlling since she was 16 and she's unsure about normalcy suggests she might not have had experience with healthy relationships. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to socialize. Her husband's actions are restrictive and unhealthy. The answer should be B.\n"
