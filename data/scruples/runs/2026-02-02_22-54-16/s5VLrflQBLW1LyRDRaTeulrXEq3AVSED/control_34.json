We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a woman in a 15-year marriage with four kids. She wants to occasionally go out with friends, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to do so without him. He's been like this for ten years and has some controlling behaviors, like not trusting people, being clingy, and possibly causing scenes if she goes out. She brings in 80% of the income, which adds another layer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage. It's common for people to have some level of independence and social life outside their marriage. The husband's stance seems restrictive. He's not physically abusive but has a lot of control, which might be emotional or psychological. The fact that they were together since she was 16 could mean she hasn't had much experience with other relationships or social norms, making it harder for her to see his behavior as problematic.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her husband. However, societal norms have evolved, and many married people have friends and socialize independently. His insistence that he's protecting her and that people are dangerous might be a way to control her. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out is concerning and points to controlling behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband does take her on weekly dinners and wants to spend time with her. But the key issue is her autonomy. She has a right to her own social life, especially since she's contributing significantly to the family income. The husband's control over her actions, even without physical abuse, is a red flag. The fact that she's unsure because of her upbringing and his convincing nature complicates her perception.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? No. Wanting to have a social life isn't unreasonable. The husband's behavior is more concerning because it restricts her autonomy. The answer should be B.\n"
