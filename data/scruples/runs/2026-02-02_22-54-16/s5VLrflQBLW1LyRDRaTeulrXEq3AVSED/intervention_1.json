We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go out before. He's being controlling and insistent, even though he's not physically abusive. The author is asking if it's normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He's using the idea that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him, which is a bit of a traditional view, but in modern relationships, mutual respect and autonomy are important. The author is a working parent, contributing 80% of the income, which shows she's independent. She just wants some social time, which is reasonable for mental health and personal fulfillment.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he doesn't want to be alone and he's trying to protect her. But his actions, like possibly tracking her down or causing a scene, indicate a lack of trust and control issues. Even if he's not abusive, controlling behavior can be harmful. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 and she doesn't know what else is normal suggests she might be in an emotionally abusive situation without realizing it.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's definitely normal for married people to have friends and socialize outside their relationship. Healthy relationships allow both partners some independence. The author isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasionally, which is reasonable. The husband's insistence on being the sole social companion and his need for control might stem from insecurity or possessiveness, which isn't healthy for the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's seeking a balance in her life and autonomy, which is a right she has. The husband's behavior is problematic because it's controlling and limits her personal freedom. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
