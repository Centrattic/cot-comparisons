We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a married woman with four kids. She wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate unless she's with him. He's been this way for ten years. They used to go out more when they were younger. Now, he's insistent that she can't go out alone and might cause a scene if she does. He's controlling and clingy, according to her.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about autonomy in marriage. The husband's stance seems controlling. He's making decisions about her social life, not trusting her, and using emotional manipulation (\"you need me to protect you\"). Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control is a red flag. The author is seeking validation that going out with friends without her husband is normal. \n\nMarriage should allow both partners some independence. The husband's behavior restricts her autonomy. The fact that he's been this way for ten years and might cause a scene if she goes out shows he's not respecting her need for personal space. The author isn't asking for weekly outings, just occasional fun with friends. \n\nHer uncertainty comes from growing up in an abnormal family and being with her husband since 16, so she might not know what a healthy relationship looks like. However, the husband's insistence on control is problematic. The answer is B because the author is not in the wrong. She has a right to her own social life and autonomy within the marriage.\n"
