We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author (a 34-year-old married mother of four) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. The author brings in 80% of the family income and wants to do something fun occasionally. The husband's reaction could include tracking her down, causing a scene, or a long discussion at home if she goes against his wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author is a working mom with a significant income, which suggests she's a contributing member of the household. Her husband's stance seems to be about control and lack of trust, given he's not physically abusive but is insistent and clingy. The question is about societal norms and marital expectations regarding socializing without a spouse.\n\nIn many modern relationships, it's common for individuals to maintain their own social lives. The husband's belief that it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without him might stem from traditional or controlling views. The fact that he's been in this relationship since she was 16 (so she's been with him since adolescence) and has an unconventional family background might mean she hasn't had the chance to see other relationship dynamics. This could make her more susceptible to his influence.\n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014tracking her, causing scenes, or extended discussions\u2014could be signs of emotional control. Even if he's not physically abusive, his insistence on controlling her social life might be a form of emotional manipulation. The key issue here is the husband's resistance to her autonomy, which is a red flag in a healthy relationship.\n\nThe author isn't asking to go out frequently, just occasionally. That's a reasonable request. The husband's arguments about fairness and normalcy are subjective and based on his personal beliefs rather than objective standards. Healthy relationships typically respect each other's need for personal space and social interactions.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking to maintain her individuality and well-being, which is valid. The husband's behavior is the issue here, as it's about control rather than genuine concern. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
