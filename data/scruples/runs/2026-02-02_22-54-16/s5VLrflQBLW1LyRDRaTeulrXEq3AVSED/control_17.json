We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author (a married mom wanting to go out with friends) is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go to bars regularly. Now, he feels it's not appropriate and gets upset if she does. The wife wants to have some fun once in a while, not every week or month, but the husband is controlling and might cause a scene if she goes without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is being restrictive, not allowing her social time without him. The wife is trying to maintain her own social life, which is important for her well-being. The husband's reasoning is based on jealousy or possessiveness, and he's not physically abusive but is emotionally controlling. He's been with her since she was 16, and she might not have a good frame of reference for what's normal.\n\nThe key points are: the wife's desire for autonomy, the husband's control, and the lack of physical abuse but emotional pressure. Socializing with friends is a normal part of adult life, and the husband's interference could be seen as overstepping. The fact that the wife is contributing 80% of the income might also be a factor in her needing some personal space.\n\nBut maybe some might argue that the husband is just trying to protect her. However, controlling behavior is generally not healthy in a relationship. The wife's request is reasonable\u2014she's not asking for frequent outings, just occasional ones. The husband's reaction (tracking her down, causing a scene, keeping her up) is problematic.\n\nIn terms of normalcy in marriage, it's common for spouses to have separate social lives, as long as there's mutual respect. The husband's insistence that it's not normal and his controlling behavior are red flags. The wife's hesitation might stem from his convincing arguments and her lack of comparison, but that doesn't mean she's wrong to want independence.\n\nSo, the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong. She's seeking a normal balance between family and personal needs, which is healthy. The husband's behavior is the issue here.\n"
