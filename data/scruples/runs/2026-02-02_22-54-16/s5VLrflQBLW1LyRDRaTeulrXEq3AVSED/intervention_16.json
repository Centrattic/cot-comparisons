We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they have a long marriage and four kids. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling and insists it's not appropriate. The author brings in most of the family income and just wants some social time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. Generally, it's healthy for individuals to have their own social circles and personal time. The husband's reasoning seems to stem from insecurity or control issues. He's been with her since she was 16, and she mentions not knowing what's normal because of her background. That might mean she's been influenced by his views without having other experiences to compare.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and mutual respect. The husband's insistence on controlling her social life could be a red flag for emotional control. Even though he's not abusive, being insistent and possibly causing scenes or sleepless nights if she goes out shows a lack of respect for her needs. The fact that she brings in 80% of the income adds another layer, suggesting she's a contributing member of the household and deserves personal time.\n\nThe author is seeking validation for her desire to socialize, which is a normal and healthy part of life. The husband's behavior seems to limit her autonomy, which isn't right. The question is about whether she's in the wrong, and based on the information, it seems like the husband is the one overstepping. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
