We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that she's married 15 years, has four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He's not physically abusive but is controlling and insists on keeping her close. She brings in most of the income and wants just some social time.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems to be about control and lack of trust. He's not allowing her to have independence, which is a red flag in relationships. Normal socializing is important for mental health and personal well-being. The fact that she's been with him since 16 might mean she's never had much autonomy, making it harder to recognize healthy boundaries.\n\nThe husband's reasoning that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him is outdated and restrictive. Healthy relationships allow both partners to have their own social lives. The author's request for occasional fun isn't excessive, especially if she's responsible and contributes financially. The husband's potential reactions (tracking her down, causing a scene) suggest emotional control, which isn't acceptable.\n\nAlso, the user's own feelings of uncertainty because of her upbringing might be clouding her judgment. But the key here is that she's seeking validation on what's normal. The answer should support her right to independence. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
