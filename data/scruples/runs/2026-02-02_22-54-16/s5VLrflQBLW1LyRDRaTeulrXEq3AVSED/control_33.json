We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He feels it's not appropriate and is controlling, not physically abusive but very insistent. The author wants to go out occasionally for fun, but the husband might cause a scene if she does.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points here are about autonomy in marriage, socializing without a spouse, and potential controlling behavior.\n\nThe husband's stance is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her husband. However, the author is responsible for most of the family income and wants to have some freedom. The husband's behavior includes control, insistence, and possible clinginess. He also lacks trust in others and might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out without him.\n\nIn terms of normalcy, in modern relationships, it's generally accepted that both partners should have their own social lives unless there are specific circumstances. The husband's reasoning seems to stem from control rather than a mutual agreement. The fact that he's been controlling for 15 years, since the author was 16, and she doesn't know what's normal, complicates things because she might not have a frame of reference.\n\nThe author isn't asking to go out every week or month, just occasionally. The husband's reaction could be overbearing, which might indicate an issue of control rather than a genuine concern. The fact that he's not physically abusive but emotionally controlling is still problematic. The author's desire to maintain her own social life is reasonable. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess further suggest that his objections are not just about normal socializing but about maintaining control.\n\nTherefore, considering the dynamics here, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to have her own social time. Her husband's behavior is more concerning as it's controlling and restrictive. The answer should be B (No).\n"
