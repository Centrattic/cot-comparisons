We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite being married. The situation involves a 15-year marriage with four kids. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go out before. He's concerned about her going out alone, and she wants some independence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband isn't physically abusive but is very controlling and insistent. He takes her on weekly dinner dates and spends time with her, but he doesn't want her to have separate social interactions. The author is responsible for most of the family's income, which adds another layer because she's contributing significantly. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is about fairness for him and his belief in what's normal for a married woman. However, his control might be overstepping. The user mentions that he has a clingy and distrustful nature, which could be causing the conflict. The author is unsure because of her background and how long they've been together.\n\nNow, societal norms vary, but in many modern relationships, having personal space and social time is considered healthy. The husband's behavior might stem from insecurity or a lack of trust. The fact that he might cause a scene or disrupt her plans if she goes against his wishes suggests a lack of respect for her autonomy. \n\nThe author isn't asking to go out frequently, just occasionally for something fun. It's reasonable for someone in a marriage to want some independence. The husband's control, even if not physical, can be emotionally restrictive. The fact that she's the main breadwinner might also imply she should have a say in her own time. \n\nHowever, the user might wonder if the husband's concerns are valid. But given the description, it seems more about his need for control rather than her well-being. The key here is whether wanting to have some social time without the spouse is unreasonable. In most contexts, it's normal and healthy to have separate friendships and activities. The husband's resistance might be an issue of control rather than genuine concern. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more about his own issues (clinginess, lack of trust) rather than valid reasons. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
