We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go to the bar regularly. Now, he feels it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without him. The author wants to have some fun once in a while, not every week. The husband is insistent, maybe controlling, and she's unsure because her family background isn't normal and she's been with him since 16.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if wanting to have a social life outside the marriage is something that's generally considered acceptable. In most relationships, it's normal for individuals to have their own social circles and to spend time with friends. The key here is that the author isn't going out every week, just occasionally. The husband's reasoning is based on jealousy or control, saying it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal. But from an outside perspective, it's reasonable for her to want some personal time.\n\nThe husband's behavior seems controlling. He's tracking her down, causing scenes, and not allowing her to have autonomy. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control is a red flag. The fact that he doesn't trust people and is clingy adds to the issue. The author is in a controlling relationship, which isn't healthy. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting independence.\n\nThe answer would likely be B (No), because wanting to socialize isn't the problem. The problem is the husband's controlling behavior. However, the author's uncertainty stems from her upbringing and the long-term relationship dynamics. But in terms of societal norms, it's normal for married people to have friends and social lives. The husband's objections are more about control than normal concerns. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends.\n"
