We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author has four kids and her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. They used to go to the bar together when they were younger, but for the past ten years, the husband has been against it. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling and insistent that he's just protecting her. The author brings in most of the family income and wants to socialize occasionally, not regularly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. Generally, it's important for individuals in a relationship to maintain their own social lives. Social interactions outside the relationship can be healthy for both parties. The husband's reasoning seems to be based on his own insecurities or lack of trust, not on any valid reason related to the author's well-being. He mentions not wanting to be alone, which is more about his needs than hers. \n\nThe author is a responsible parent and provider, so wanting to have some fun once in a while doesn't seem unreasonable. The husband's behavior of possibly tracking her down or causing a scene if she goes out suggests overstepping boundaries. Control and clinginess can be signs of possessiveness, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the author's background is mentioned as not normal, and she's been with her husband since 16, making her dependent on his perspective. This might indicate that she's in a situation where her autonomy is restricted, which isn't right. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't. She's seeking a balanced approach to her personal life and family responsibilities. The husband's actions are the ones that might be problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
