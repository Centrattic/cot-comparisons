We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go to bars together. Now, he feels it's inappropriate and might track her down or cause a scene if she goes. The author brings in 80% of the income and has been with him since she was 16, so she's not sure what's normal.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about a married woman's right to socialize without her spouse. The husband's behavior seems controlling and possessive. He's not physically abusive, but his insistence on her presence and lack of trust could indicate emotional control. The author wants to have fun occasionally, which is reasonable. The husband's reasoning about fairness and normalcy might be a way to justify his control rather than a genuine concern. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should have autonomy. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 and she's unsure what's normal suggests possible power imbalances. The husband's reaction (tracking her down, causing a scene) is a red flag for controlling behavior. The author's desire to socialize isn't unreasonable, especially since she contributes significantly to the family income. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's actions are more concerning. The author is seeking validation for her desire to maintain her own social life, which is a normal and healthy part of marriage. The husband's insistence on her not being out without him, especially with potential for conflict, shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. The fact that she doesn't expect frequent outings but just occasional ones also means it's not excessive. The husband's behavior is likely what's problematic here, not her wanting to go out.\n"
