We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the married mom wanting to go out with friends) is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go out to bars regularly. Now he's against it, saying it's not appropriate for a married woman. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling. She's responsible and brings in 80% of the income. She just wants to go out occasionally for something fun. If she goes, he might track her down, cause a scene, or keep her up at night arguing. They've been together since she was 16, and she's unsure what's normal because her family wasn't normal.\n\nSo, the key points here are her desire for personal space and social interaction, which is a common need in relationships. The husband's behavior seems controlling and restrictive. He's not abusive physically, but his emotional control is significant. He's making her feel like she can't make her own decisions, even for her own well-being and happiness.\n\nThe question is about normalcy in marriage. Generally, in healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize and maintain their individuality. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone is a bit self-centered. His not trusting others and being clingy also points to possible issues in the marriage dynamics. The fact that she's bringing in most of the income adds another layer, as it might contribute to her needing independence and time for herself.\n\nHer husband's potential reactions\u2014tracking her down, causing a scene\u2014indicate that he doesn't respect her autonomy. Even if he's trying to \"protect\" her, controlling behavior isn't healthy. The community here would likely side with her right to have her own social life, especially since she's not doing it frequently and is responsible.\n\nAlso, considering she's been with him since 16 and has no other frame of reference, it's possible she's internalized his beliefs about her role. The community's role is to validate that wanting personal time is normal and not the fault of the person seeking it. So, in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. Her husband's behavior is the issue here, not her wanting to go out occasionally.\n"
