We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a married woman) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The couple has been married 15 years, four kids, and the husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He's controlling, doesn't trust people, and has a lot of control over her. The wife is responsible for most of the family income and just wants some social time.\n\nThe husband's arguments are based on tradition and his feelings of fairness. He doesn't want to be alone and thinks it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without her spouse. However, his behavior seems controlling\u2014tracking her down, causing scenes, not trusting people. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships allow both partners some independence.\n\nThe wife's desire for socializing isn't excessive\u2014just once in a while. She's bringing in most of the income, which adds to the imbalance. The husband's insistence on controlling her movements could be seen as stifling her autonomy. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 and she's unsure what's normal might indicate a lack of independence in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of norms, it's generally accepted that adults in relationships need some personal space and social time. The husband's reaction seems more about control than legitimate concerns. The wife isn't doing anything wrong by seeking personal time. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
