We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author is a married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. She wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't agree. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He controls her, doesn't trust people, and can be clingy. They've been together since she was 16, so she might not have a good frame of reference for what's normal.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's controlling behavior and lack of trust. He's not physically abusive, but he exerts control by threatening to track her down, cause a scene, or keep her up discussing it. That's emotional control, which is a red flag. The fact that he doesn't allow her to go out even occasionally, especially when she's bringing in 80% of the income, suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nSocializing is important for mental health and personal well-being. The author isn't asking to go out every week, just once in a while. The husband's reasoning that it's \"not normal\" is subjective and possibly based on his own insecurities or past experiences. Since the author comes from an unstable family background, she might not know what a healthy relationship looks like. The husband's behavior\u2014being clingy, controlling, and not trusting people\u2014indicates that the issue isn't with the author wanting to socialize, but with his lack of trust and control issues.\n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize and maintain their own identities. The husband's actions are stifling the author's independence, which isn't acceptable. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because her desire for social time is reasonable and the husband is the one acting inappropriately by controlling and restricting her.\n"
