We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, asking if it's wrong for her to want to go out with friends. Her husband, who's 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him and feels it's inappropriate for a married woman. They used to go out to the bar regularly when they were younger, but the husband hasn't wanted to in the past ten years.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about the husband's control over her social life. He's not physically abusive but is insistent and has a lot of control. If she goes out, he might cause a scene or keep her up all night discussing it. That sounds manipulative and controlling. The user brings in 80% of the family income, which shows she's a significant contributor. She doesn't come from a \"normal\" family and has been with her husband since she was 16, so maybe she's not confident in what's considered normal in relationships.\n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have autonomy and the right to socialize. The husband's reasoning about it not being fair for him to be alone and not trusting people could be red flags. Socializing with friends is important for mental health and personal relationships. The fact that the husband is trying to \"protect\" her from people and situations might be a way to exert control rather than a genuine concern.\n\nThe user mentions she doesn't want to go out every week, just once in a while. That's reasonable. The husband's reaction, like tracking her down or causing a scene, is overbearing. It's not about the frequency but about the autonomy and respect in the relationship. The husband's behavior could indicate a lack of trust or insecurity, which isn't a healthy dynamic.\n\nSince the user is seeking validation on what's normal, the consensus would likely be that she's not in the wrong. However, the situation might call for communication or even counseling to address the husband's controlling tendencies and ensure both partners feel respected.\n"
