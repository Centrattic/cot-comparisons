We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the author (a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids) used to go to the bar with her husband when they were younger, but now he doesn't want to go out socially and feels it's not appropriate for her to go out without him. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, doesn't trust people, is clingy, and might cause a scene if she goes out. She brings in 80% of the family income and wants to socialize occasionally.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if wanting to go out with friends without her husband is wrong. The key points here are about normality in marriage regarding socializing. The husband's stance is that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her spouse, but the author is seeking validation on whether that's the case. \n\nMarriage doesn't require a spouse to accompany each other to all social events. It's common for partners to have separate interests and social circles. The husband's control over her actions, even if not abusive, might indicate a lack of trust or overstepping boundaries. The fact that he takes her on weekly dinners suggests he does want to spend time with her, but his insistence on being the only one to socialize with her could be problematic. \n\nThe author's financial contribution (80% of income) adds another layer. It's not about financial responsibility here, but about personal freedom. The husband's behavior, like possibly tracking her down or causing a scene, suggests that his disapproval could lead to conflict. The author's uncertainty stems from her family background and the long-term relationship since she was 16, which might have limited her exposure to other dynamics. \n\nSo, the question is about whether the husband's control is reasonable or if the author's desire for some independence is normal. The answer would likely lean towards B (No), because the author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by wanting to socialize. The husband's behavior is more about his own insecurities and control issues rather than the author's actions. The author isn't being neglectful; she's seeking balance and a bit of personal time, which is important for mental health and maintaining individuality in a marriage. The fact that the husband is insistent and it's causing conflict suggests that he's the one not handling the situation well, not the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
