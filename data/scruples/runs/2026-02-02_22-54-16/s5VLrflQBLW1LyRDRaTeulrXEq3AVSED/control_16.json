We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is a married woman with four kids, and she's asking if she's in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him and feels it's not appropriate. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling and insistent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband has been this way for ten years, and they've been married since she was 16. That might mean she's been in this relationship for a long time without much comparison, which could affect her perception of what's normal. The husband's reasoning is about fairness and normalcy, but his behavior seems controlling. He might be jealous or have trust issues.\n\nThe key points here are her right to socialize and the husband's control. The fact that she brings in 80% of the income suggests she's a contributing member of the family, which might make her want some independence. The husband's reaction could be overbearing, like tracking her down or causing a scene. That sounds like emotional control rather than reasonable concern.\n\nIn terms of normal socializing in a marriage, it's generally okay for spouses to have their own social lives. The husband's insistence that it's not normal and his lack of trust might be indicative of a controlling personality. The fact that she's been with him since 16 and doesn't have a frame of reference for a healthy relationship complicates things. She might be in a situation where her autonomy is being restricted.\n\nSo, the question is whether wanting to go out with friends is reasonable. Since she's not doing it frequently and just wants to have some fun occasionally, it's a basic need for social connection. The husband's response, however, is extreme. The answer would likely be B (No) because the husband's behavior is controlling and she's not in the wrong for wanting independence."
