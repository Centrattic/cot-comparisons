We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the married woman (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite her husband's objections. The husband doesn't want her to go out without him, feels it's inappropriate, and might act controlling if she does. The key points here are the husband's controlling behavior, lack of trust, and the author's desire for some autonomy.\n\nFirst, the husband's behavior sounds like it's overstepping. He's not just expressing a preference but making it clear he wants control over her social life. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out suggests emotional control or even potential emotional abuse. Healthy relationships allow both partners some independence. The author bringing in most of the family's income doesn't mean she owes him her time; financial contributions don't dictate personal freedom.\n\nThe husband's reasoning about fairness is problematic because he's focusing on his own loneliness rather than respecting her need for socialization. The author wants to go out occasionally, which is reasonable. The husband's insistence that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her husband is a red flag. It's not about normality but about respecting each other's autonomy. The fact that they've been together since she was 16 and she's unsure about his validity points to possible gaslighting or manipulation.\n\nThe author isn't asking to go out every week, just occasionally, which is a basic need for many people. The husband's controlling behavior is the real issue here. The answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking a healthy balance in her marriage, which is reasonable. The husband's reactions indicate a need for the relationship to be evaluated for healthy boundaries.\n"
