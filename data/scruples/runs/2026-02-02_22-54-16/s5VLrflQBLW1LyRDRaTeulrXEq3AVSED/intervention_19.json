We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. She wants to go out with friends occasionally but her husband doesn't approve. He's been like this for ten years, not wanting to socialize outside the family. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The husband is controlling, not physically abusive but emotionally controlling, and she's not sure what's normal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wants some independence, which is a basic human need. The husband is being controlling and doesn't trust people, which can be a red flag. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out shows his lack of trust and possible emotional control. The author brings in most of the family income, which might mean she's the primary earner, yet she's restricted in her social life. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse. But socializing with friends is a common and healthy part of adult life. The author isn't asking to go out every week, just occasionally. The husband's behavior seems to stem from insecurity or clinginess, not from a place of mutual respect.\n\nThe author mentions she's been with him since she was 16 and doesn't know what's normal. That might mean she's been in the relationship for a long time without exposure to other relationships. The husband's insistence on controlling her actions could be emotional manipulation. The fact that he doesn't trust people and clings to her might indicate issues with his own self-esteem or past experiences.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, married people often have friends and social lives outside their marriage. It's important for both partners to have some independence. The husband's reaction to her going out\u2014tracking her down, causing scenes\u2014suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. The author isn't doing anything extreme; she just wants to maintain her social connections, which is healthy.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. The husband's behavior is controlling and restrictive, which isn't healthy in a marriage. The author is seeking validation for her desire to have a social life, which is reasonable. The answer should be B, no, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
