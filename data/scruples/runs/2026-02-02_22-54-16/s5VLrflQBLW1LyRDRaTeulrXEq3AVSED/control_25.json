We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 15-year marriage with four kids. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. He's not physically abusive but has a lot of control and can be insistent.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author wants occasional social time, which is reasonable. The husband's reasoning is that it's unfair for him to be alone and that it's not normal. However, his behavior includes potentially tracking her, causing scenes, or keeping her up discussing it. That's controlling behavior. The author is the primary breadwinner, which adds context to her role in the household.\n\nNormal socializing in a marriage usually allows each partner some independence. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess could indicate possessiveness or emotional control. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 and she has nothing to compare to might mean she's never had her own social life, so this is a new desire for autonomy.\n\nControl and insistence on his views of normalcy without considering her needs are red flags. The husband's behavior crosses into emotional manipulation or control if he's threatening or trying to isolate her. While the husband might not see it as wrong, from an external perspective, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking normal social interactions. The key is that she's not being unreasonable (just occasional outings) and the husband's response is overbearing.\n"
