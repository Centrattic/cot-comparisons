We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a married woman who wants to go out with friends but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to do so without him. They've been married for 15 years, and he's been against social outings for the past ten. He's not physically abusive but is controlling and clingy. She brings in 80% of the family income.\n\nFirst, the question is about her wanting to have a social life. The key points here are the husband's control over her decisions and his insistence that it's not normal for her to go out. The husband's behavior sounds like emotional control, maybe even emotional abuse. He's not allowing her autonomy, which is important in a healthy relationship.\n\nThe woman is seeking validation on whether she's wrong to want independence. The husband's reasoning that it's \"not fair\" for him to sit alone and that it's \"not normal\" for a married woman to go out without her husband is problematic. Normalcy varies, and a healthy marriage should allow both partners some independence.\n\nShe mentions he can be insistent and convincing, which might make her doubt her own needs. Since she's been with him since 16, she might not have a good model for a healthy relationship. The fact that she's responsible and contributes significantly to income means she's not being unreasonable by wanting her own time.\n\nThe husband's potential reactions\u2014tracking her down, causing a scene, keeping her up discussing\u2014indicate he's not respecting her autonomy and is trying to maintain control. This isn't normal in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the woman is not in the wrong for wanting to socialize and asserting her independence. The answer should be B.\n"
