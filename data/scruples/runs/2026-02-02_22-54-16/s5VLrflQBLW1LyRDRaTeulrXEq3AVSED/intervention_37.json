We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The scenario is that the author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, citing that it's not appropriate for a married woman. They used to go out before, but now he's against it. The husband is possessive, controlling, and doesn't trust people. The author just wants to have some fun once in a while but fears her husband might react negatively, like causing a scene or keeping her up discussing it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user already thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation. \n\nLooking at the details: The husband is controlling, doesn't trust people, and is insistent about not letting her go out. The author wants to socialize occasionally, which is reasonable. The husband's reasoning seems to stem from possessiveness and lack of trust, not from any valid concern like safety or alcoholism. The author is responsible, brings in most of the income, and the husband isn't physically abusive but exerts emotional control. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's behavior restricts the author's autonomy. The fact that they've been together since she was 16 might indicate she's been in a long-term relationship without comparison, making it hard for her to recognize controlling behavior. The author's desire for personal space and socializing isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe key points are the husband's control and lack of trust versus the author's need for personal freedom. Since the husband's actions are restrictive and not based on valid reasons, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
