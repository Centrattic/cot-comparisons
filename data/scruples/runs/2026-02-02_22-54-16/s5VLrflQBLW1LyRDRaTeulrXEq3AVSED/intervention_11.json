We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a 34-year-old married woman with four kids) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to the bar together. Now, he's against it, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. The user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong, but they want confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is being controlling, not physically abusive but insistent on his views. He might track her down or cause a scene if she goes. The author is responsible, contributes more financially, and wants some social time. The husband's reasoning is about fairness and normalcy, but this could be overstepping. \n\nThe question is about normal socializing in a marriage. Typically, having some independent social time is healthy. The husband's behavior seems to be about control and insecurity. He doesn't trust people and is clingy. The author's background is non-normal family, which might have affected her ability to see what's healthy. \n\nThe husband's stance is that it's not fair for him to be alone, but that doesn't give him the right to dictate her social life. Marriage should allow both partners autonomy. The fact that he's been this way for ten years and the author is only now seeking this autonomy might indicate a shift in her needs, which is valid. \n\nThe author isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasional fun. The husband's reaction could be overbearing, especially if it leads to him tracking or confronting her. This might be a form of emotional control. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to socialize. The husband's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
