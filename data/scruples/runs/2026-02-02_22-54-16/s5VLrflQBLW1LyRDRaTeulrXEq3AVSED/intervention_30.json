We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a married woman in her 30s who wants to go out with her friends. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though he's been doing this for the past ten years. They've been married for 15 years and have four kids. The husband's reasoning is about what's normal and fair for him. The author brings in 80% of the family income and wants some fun once in a while.\n\nHmm, the husband's behavior seems controlling. He's making her feel like she's the problem for wanting her own social life. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out is a red flag. He's not physically abusive, but emotional control is still a form of abuse. The author mentions that he's clingy and doesn't trust others. Also, they were together since she was 16, which might have led to her not having a good comparison for healthy relationships. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect in a marriage. Every adult should have the right to a social life. The husband's insistence on controlling her actions is problematic. Even though he takes her on dinner dates, that's not a substitute for her own friendships. The author is seeking validation on whether her desire for personal time is reasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Her wanting to maintain her own social life is normal and healthy. The husband's behavior is controlling and not respecting her autonomy. The author isn't doing anything wrong by seeking balance in her life.\n"
