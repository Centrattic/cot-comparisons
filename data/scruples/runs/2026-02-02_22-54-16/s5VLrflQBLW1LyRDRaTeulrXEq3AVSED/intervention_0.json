We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 15-year marriage with four kids, where the husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He's not physically abusive but has control issues and doesn't trust people. The author brings in most of the income and wants some fun once in a while.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him. But the author is asking if that's actually normal. From what I know about healthy relationships, both partners should have autonomy. Being married doesn't mean you lose your social life. The husband's insistence might be controlling, especially if he's tracking her down or causing scenes if she goes out. That sounds like emotional control. Also, the fact that she's the primary breadwinner adds another layer because she's contributing significantly to the family, so she should have the right to her own time.\n\nThe husband's lack of trust and clinginess could be red flags. He might be projecting his own insecurities or trying to maintain control. The author mentions she doesn't come from a normal family and has been with him since 16, so she might not have a good frame of reference for what's normal. It's possible she's been in a relationship where the husband's needs were prioritized over hers for a long time.\n\nIn terms of social norms, many married people have friends and go out without their spouse. It's part of maintaining one's identity and mental health. The husband's stance seems restrictive. The key points are control, autonomy, and what's typical in a healthy marriage. The author isn't asking to go out frequently, just occasionally, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction of causing a scene or keeping her up all night is definitely overreacting and unhealthy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking a balance between family responsibilities and her own well-being. The husband's behavior is more concerning here. The answer should be B.\n"
