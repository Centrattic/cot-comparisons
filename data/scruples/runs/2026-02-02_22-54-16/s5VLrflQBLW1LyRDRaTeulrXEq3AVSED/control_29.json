We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 34-year-old mother of four, married for 15 years. She used to go out to bars with her husband when they were younger, but now he doesn't want to go out socially. He feels it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. She wants to have some fun occasionally, maybe once in a while. The husband takes her on a weekly dinner date and spends time with her in family settings. \n\nHe argues it's unfair for him to be alone and that it's not normal. She brings in 80% of the family's income. If she goes out despite his protests, he might track her down, cause a scene, or keep her up discussing it. He's not physically abusive but has a lot of control and can be clingy. She's unsure if he's right because she doesn't know other relationships to compare, having been with him since 16.\n\nThe main issue is whether she's wrong for wanting to socialize without him. From a general standpoint, marriage should allow both partners personal freedom. However, the husband's behavior is controlling, making her feel she can't go out. He's not abusive but uses emotional pressure. Her wanting to maintain some independence isn't unreasonable, especially since she contributes financially and needs social time. The husband's insistence on control seems excessive. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking her own happiness and autonomy within the marriage. So the answer should be B.\n"
