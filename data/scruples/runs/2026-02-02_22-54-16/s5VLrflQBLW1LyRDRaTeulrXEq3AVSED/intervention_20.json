We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (a married woman with kids) is at fault for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to do that before. He's not physically abusive but is controlling, insists on his views of what's \"normal,\" and might react strongly if she goes anyway.\n\nFirst, the author wants to have some social time, which is a common need for many people, especially in long-term relationships. The husband's reasoning is based on his comfort and his belief about what's appropriate for a married woman. However, his behavior seems to be more about control and his own insecurities rather than genuine concern for her well-being. The fact that he can be clingy and insistent, and that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out, points to a lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have the right to socialize independently without fear of being controlled or punished. The husband's actions suggest an overstepping of boundaries, which is not normal in a balanced relationship. The author isn't being irresponsible by wanting to spend time with friends; it's a reasonable desire for personal space and social interaction, especially when she contributes significantly to the family income.\n\nThe husband's argument that it's not fair for him to be alone is valid in terms of his feelings, but that doesn't justify controlling her actions. The author should be able to maintain her own social life without it causing conflict. The fact that the husband might react with emotional manipulation (keeping her up all night, causing a scene) indicates that his behavior is problematic.\n\nThe author's background of coming from a non-normal family and having been with her husband since 16 might have influenced her perception of what's normal. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners should encourage each other's independence. The husband's insistence on control and his lack of trust in others (and possibly her) are red flags. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while opinions vary, having a social life without one's spouse is generally considered normal and healthy. The husband's stance seems more rooted in his personal issues rather than objective standards. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking this balance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
