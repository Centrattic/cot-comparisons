He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe woman is 34, married for 15 years, with four kids aged 7-17. They used to go out to bars regularly when they were younger, but the husband (Hubby) hasn't wanted to go out socially for the past ten years. His main issue is that he thinks it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. She wants to go out occasionally for fun, not frequently. He takes her on weekly dinner dates and spends time with her one-on-one or in family settings. However, he's concerned about being left alone and thinks she shouldn't go out. \n\nHe's not physically abusive but has control issues, is insistent, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. The author mentions that he might cause a scene or keep her up all night discussing it if she goes out without him. She's unsure if his reasoning is valid because her family isn't normal, and she's been with him since she was 16, so she has nothing else to compare it to. The core question is whether it's normal for a married person to socialize without their spouse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many cultures, it's common for married individuals to have their own social lives. However, the husband's stance is that it's not appropriate, which might stem from his personal beliefs or insecurity. The fact that he's been like this for ten years suggests it's a long-standing issue. The author is responsible and contributes significantly to the family income, which adds another layer\u2014her autonomy and financial contribution should matter in such decisions.\n\nThe husband's behavior includes controlling aspects, like not trusting people and being clingy. This could indicate a lack of trust or possessiveness. The author's desire for occasional social outings isn't excessive, just once in a while. The potential consequences he might impose (tracking her down, causing a scene) are signs of his inability to respect her autonomy, which could be a red flag for a healthy relationship.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, having a social life outside the marriage is often considered healthy for both partners. It allows individuals to maintain their identity and reduce stress. The husband's insistence on controlling her social life might be a form of emotional manipulation or control. The author's uncertainty about whether he's right could be due to his convincing nature and the long-term relationship dynamic.\n\nLegally, in most places, a spouse can't prevent the other from socializing unless there's a court order (which isn't mentioned here). Ethically, the balance between mutual respect and individual autonomy is key. The husband's actions don't reflect respect for her needs, while the author's request seems reasonable.\n\nIn terms of \"AITA,\" the question is whether she's at fault. Since she's seeking validation for a reasonable request and the husband is the one restricting her without valid reasons (no alcohol issues, just personal beliefs), the answer would lean towards her not being in the wrong. The husband's controlling behavior is problematic, and her wanting to go out is a legitimate need for personal well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
