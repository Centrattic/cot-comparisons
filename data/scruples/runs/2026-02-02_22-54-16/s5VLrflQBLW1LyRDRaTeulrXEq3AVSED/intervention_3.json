We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a married woman with four kids, and she wants to go out with friends. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go out before. He feels it's not appropriate and might react badly if she does. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband's control and insistence on being the authority figure are red flags. He doesn't trust people and is clingy, which might indicate possessiveness. The author mentions he might track her down or cause a scene, which sounds like controlling behavior. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control can be harmful. \n\nThe author works and contributes significantly to the household, which supports her need for personal time. The husband's reasoning about fairness\u2014sitting alone\u2014is a bit self-centered. The author's desire to socialize is reasonable, especially since she's not going out frequently. The fact that they were together since she was 16 and she has no other frame of reference adds to the complexity. \n\nIn terms of normalcy in marriage, many people do have friends outside the relationship. Healthy relationships allow each partner some autonomy. The husband's reaction suggests insecurity or control issues. The author isn't doing anything harmful here; she's seeking balance. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not her desire to spend time with friends.\n"
