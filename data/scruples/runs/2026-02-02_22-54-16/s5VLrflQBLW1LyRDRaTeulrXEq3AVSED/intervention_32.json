We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a married mom who wants to go out with friends but her husband doesn't agree. The husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though she's not drinking and it's just occasional. He gets very insistent and might cause a scene if she goes. The author is responsible for most of the family income and feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He doesn't trust people, is clingy, and doesn't let her socialize. Even though he's not physically abusive, his insistence on controlling her social life could be a red flag. The author is seeking validation on whether it's normal for a married woman to socialize without her husband. From a general perspective, yes, it's normal. People in relationships should have some independence. \n\nThe husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone might not justify controlling her. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. The author's need for personal time and socializing is valid. She's contributing financially, which adds to the argument that she deserves personal space. \n\nHowever, the user mentions that the husband takes her on weekly dates and spends time with her. But that's within the family or one-on-one, not allowing her to have friends. The key issue is the control and lack of trust. The husband's behavior could be stifling her personal freedom, which is a concern in a healthy relationship. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain her social life. It's important for mental health and well-being. The husband's response is the problem here. So, based on this analysis, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
