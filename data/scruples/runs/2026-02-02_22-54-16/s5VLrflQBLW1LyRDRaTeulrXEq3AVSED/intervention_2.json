We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the married woman is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's been married for 15 years, has four kids, and they used to go out more in the past. Now her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though there's no alcohol issue. She wants to have some fun occasionally, like once a month. The husband feels it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her spouse. He's also described as controlling, insistent, and possibly overprotective. She's responsible for most of the family's income and comes from a non-normal family, which might affect her perspective.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal freedom in a marriage. Is it normal for her to want to socialize without her husband? From a general perspective, many people believe that both partners should have the right to have their own social lives. However, the husband's reaction seems controlling. He might be trying to protect her, but his behavior\u2014like possibly tracking her down or causing scenes\u2014suggests that his control is overstepping.\n\nThe woman is seeking validation about what's normal. The husband's stance might be based on his own beliefs or upbringing, but restricting her social life without a valid reason isn't typically considered healthy. The fact that he controls her and is clingy adds to the concern. She's in a situation where she might feel trapped because of her past and his convincing arguments, but she's recognizing that she needs her own space.\n\nI think the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The husband's behavior is problematic, and she's justified in wanting her own social interactions. It's important for both partners to have independence in a healthy relationship. However, there might be nuances if there are cultural or religious factors, but the question doesn't mention those. The main issue here is the husband's control rather than her desire to socialize.\n"
