We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman in a 15-year marriage with four kids. She wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to do so without him. He controls her, doesn't trust people, and gets insistent. She brings in most of the family income.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is autonomy in a marriage. The husband's stance is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse. However, the woman wants some personal freedom. \n\nThe husband's behavior sounds controlling. He has a lot of control over her, isn't physically abusive but can be insistent and clingy. This kind of control might be a form of emotional manipulation. The fact that he might track her down or cause scenes if she goes out without him is concerning. Healthy relationships allow for individual autonomy and mutual respect.\n\nThe woman's desire to have her own social life is reasonable. It's not unreasonable for someone to want to spend time with friends, especially since they have kids and a long-term marriage. The husband's lack of trust and need for control are problematic. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for wanting this, but based on the description, it seems the husband is the one being restrictive.\n\nThe answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because wanting personal autonomy and socializing with friends is normal. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not the woman's desire for independence.\n"
