We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman in a 15-year marriage with four kids. She wants to go out with friends occasionally but her husband is against it, saying it's not appropriate for a married woman to go without him. He's not abusive but is very controlling, doesn't trust people, and has a lot of influence over her. She's responsible for most of the family's income.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to have some independence. The husband's stance seems to stem from control and lack of trust, not from valid concerns. Even though he's not physically abusive, his emotional control is evident. He's been with her since she was 16, which might have affected her sense of autonomy. She mentions she doesn't have a normal family background and isn't sure what's normal, which makes her more vulnerable to his influence.\n\nThe question is about socializing without the spouse. Generally, in a healthy marriage, both partners should have autonomy to socialize. The husband's arguments about it being \"not normal\" don't hold up because socializing is a common part of adult life. She's not asking to go out frequently, just occasionally, which is reasonable. Her husband's reaction, like tracking her down or causing a scene, is controlling behavior. The fact that she's the primary breadwinner adds another layer; his control over her social life might be unfair given her contributions.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking balance and personal space, which is normal. The husband's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
