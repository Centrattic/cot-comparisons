We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The key points from the scenario are:\n\n1. The author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, married for 15 years.\n2. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. He used to go out with her when they were younger but hasn't in the past ten years.\n3. The husband doesn't have a problem with alcohol, but he's controlling, doesn't trust people, and can be clingy. He's not physically abusive but might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out despite his protests.\n4. The author is the primary breadwinner (80%+ of the family income) and feels he has too much control over her. She's unsure about what's normal because of her upbringing and long-term relationship where he's been dominant.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is not in the wrong. The task is to determine if the answer is A (Yes, author is wrong) or B (No, she's not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics. The husband's behavior seems controlling and restrictive. He's using traditional gender roles (\"not appropriate for a married woman\") to limit her autonomy. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control and lack of trust can be forms of abuse. The author deserves personal freedom and socializing is a basic need. The fact that he's insistent and might react negatively if she goes suggests a power imbalance. The author's desire for independence isn't unreasonable, especially given her role as a primary earner. Socializing with friends occasionally isn't something to be ashamed of, and it's normal for people in relationships to have some autonomy. The husband's controlling behavior is the issue here, not the author wanting to go out. So the answer should be B.\n"
