We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the woman in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. She's been married for 15 years and has four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to bars together before. Now, he's insistent that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. But he does take her out on a weekly date. The problem is when she wants to go with friends alone. \n\nShe mentions that her husband isn't physically abusive but is very controlling. He might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out without him. Also, he's clingy and doesn't trust others. She's not sure if his reasoning is valid because she doesn't come from a normal family and has been with him since she was 16, so she might not have a good frame of reference for what's normal in a marriage.\n\nThe key points here are individual autonomy and mutual respect in a relationship. The husband's control over her social life and the lack of trust could be signs of emotional control or possessiveness. The fact that he's not allowing her to have her own social time without being overbearing might be an issue. She's bringing in most of the family's income, which suggests she's a contributing member, and her need for personal time is valid.\n\nThe husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone might not fully consider her need for independence. Healthy relationships usually allow both partners some degree of personal space and social time. The fact that he's very insistent and might cause a scene if she does go out without him points to a lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nSo, putting this together, the woman wanting to go out with friends isn't in the wrong. The issue seems to be more about her husband's controlling behavior rather than her desire for social interaction. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
