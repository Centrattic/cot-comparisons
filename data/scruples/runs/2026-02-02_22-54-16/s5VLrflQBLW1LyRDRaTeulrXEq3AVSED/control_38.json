We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, and she's been married for 15 years. She used to go out to the bar with her husband when they were younger, but now he doesn't want to go out socially. Her husband is 38 and has been with her since she was 16. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, insisting that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him and that he's just protecting her. She brings in 80% of the income and wants to socialize with friends occasionally. The husband might track her down or cause a scene if she goes. She's unsure if his views are normal and wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends. The question is about what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. \n\nThe husband's behavior seems controlling. He's making her feel like she can't have friends without him, which is not typical in a healthy relationship. Control and lack of trust are red flags. Even if he's not abusive, being insistent and possibly causing a scene or tracking her down if she goes out are signs of overstepping boundaries. \n\nThe author mentions she's responsible and brings in most of the income, which suggests she's a contributing member of the family. Wanting to socialize once in a while isn't unreasonable. The fact that they used to go out before shows their relationship wasn't always like this. Now, the husband is restricting her social life, which can lead to resentment and imbalance. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, partners should support each other's autonomy and social needs. The husband's reasoning about fairness (sitting alone) is a bit self-centered. It's normal for people to have friends and socialize independently. The author shouldn't be blamed for seeking a normal social life. \n\nThe lack of trust and clinginess from the husband are issues. The answer is likely B, meaning she's not in the wrong. The situation sounds more like the husband's controlling behavior than her being at fault. \n\nSo, the answer should be B.\n"
