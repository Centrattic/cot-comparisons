We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a married woman wanting to go out with friends, but her husband is against it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids. They've been married 15 years. She wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband objects, saying it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He's been this way for ten years, and he's not alcohol-related. He takes her on a dinner date weekly but doesn't like her going out alone. He's controlling and insistent, even to the point of tracking her down if she goes. They've been together since she was 16, so she might not have a good frame of reference for normal relationships.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. So, the question is whether her wanting social time without her husband is normal and whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people believe that couples should have some independence. Marriage doesn't mean you lose your individuality. It's common for people to have friends and social lives separate from their partners. The husband's control over her actions, making her feel she can't go out even occasionally, could be seen as unhealthy. He's being overly possessive and not respecting her autonomy. The fact that he's causing potential scenes or keeping her up discussing it if she goes shows a lack of support for her needs. Since she brings in most of the income, her independence is also a factor here. \n\nThe husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone is a bit selfish. Everyone has their own social lives. It's not about fairness but about mutual respect. The author isn't asking to go every week, just occasionally. His clinginess and control suggest possible issues in the relationship. The author's uncertainty because of her upbringing and long-term relationship with him is understandable, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Her desire for personal space and social time is valid. The husband's behavior is the problematic part here, not her wanting to go out with friends.\n"
