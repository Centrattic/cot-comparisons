We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids. She and her husband used to go out to the bar when they were younger, but for the past ten years, her husband doesn't want to go out socially. He feels it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without him. She's not looking to go out every week or even monthly, just occasionally for something fun. Her husband is not physically abusive but is very controlling, insists he's being protective, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. He might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out without him. She's unsure if he's right because her family wasn't normal, and she's been with him since 16, so she doesn't have much to compare.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The husband's reasoning is that he doesn't want to be alone and that it's not normal. But the key points here are autonomy and mutual respect in a marriage. The user is asking about the normality of socializing without the spouse. In most healthy relationships, it's normal for individuals to have their own social circles and time. The husband's insistence on controlling her actions and not trusting others could be a sign of overstepping boundaries. He's also been with her since she was 16, which might have contributed to her not knowing other norms, but that doesn't make his behavior okay. The fact that he's very convincing and she's unsure if she's right adds to the complexity. However, her bringing in 80% of the family income might mean she's in a position where she can make her own decisions, but the husband's potential reactions (tracking, causing a scene) are problematic. The question is about whether she's in the wrong for wanting to go out. Since the husband is being controlling and not trusting, and her request is reasonable (occasional outings), the answer would likely be B. The husband's behavior is more concerning, and she's not wrong for seeking balance in her life.\n"
