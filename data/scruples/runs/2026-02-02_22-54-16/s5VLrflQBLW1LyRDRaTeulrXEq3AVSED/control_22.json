We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they have kids and she brings in most of the income. The husband is described as controlling, not trusting people, and clingy. He might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out without his approval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the husband's control over her social life and her feeling the need for some independence. The user wants to know if wanting to socialize separately is normal. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the right to socialize independently unless there are specific circumstances that require agreement, like kids being involved. The husband's reasoning about fairness and not being alone is a bit weak, especially since he's not preventing her from going out every time but is more about his own discomfort. The fact that he's insistent, controlling, and maybe even manipulative (being convincing and having been with her since she was 16) suggests that his control is an issue. \n\nThe author's desire to go out occasionally isn't unreasonable. She's not talking about frequent outings but just some fun once in a while. The husband's reaction could be overstepping, especially if he might cause a scene or keep her up discussing it. The fact that he has a lot of control and isn't physically abusive but is emotionally controlling points towards a problem in the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, wanting personal freedom is not wrong. The issue here is more about the husband's controlling behavior rather than the author's desire to socialize. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
