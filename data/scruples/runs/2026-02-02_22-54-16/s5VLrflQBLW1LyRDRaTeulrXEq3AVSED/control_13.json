We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, she's a married mom with four kids, married for 15 years. She wants to go out with friends sometimes, but her husband doesn't want her to go out without him. He says it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. They used to go to the bar regularly when they were younger, but now he doesn't want to go. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. He might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. The woman is asking if it's okay for her to go out without her husband. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal. But she feels like she wants some fun and social time. The key points here are autonomy, control, and what's considered normal.\n\nThe husband's behavior seems to be controlling. He doesn't trust people and doesn't want her to go out without him, which can be a red flag. Even though he's not physically abusive, his insistence on controlling her actions and possibly causing a scene if she goes out suggests emotional manipulation or control. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 and she doesn't know what's normal because of her own family background might make her more susceptible to his control.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should have the freedom to socialize and have their own lives. The husband's behavior limits her autonomy. He's making her feel like she's wrong for wanting her own social time. The fact that she brings in 80% of the family income might indicate that she's the primary breadwinner, so her independence is even more important.\n\nThe question is whether wanting to socialize without her husband is wrong. From a typical standpoint, it's not wrong. People in relationships should have their own social lives. The husband's objections seem to stem from control issues rather than valid concerns. The woman is acting within her rights to seek personal fulfillment and social interaction, which is normal and healthy.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the issue here. She's seeking a normal aspect of life that many people take for granted. The answer should be B.\n"
