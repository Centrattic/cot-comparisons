We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 15-year marriage with four kids, where the husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He feels it's not appropriate and might cause issues if she goes. The author wants to have some fun once in a while, not regularly. He's not abusive but is very controlling and insistent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He's been married since she was 16, and she doesn't have much to compare it to. His reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal. But controlling behavior is a red flag. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes shows he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe author brings in 80% of the family income, which suggests she's a significant contributor. Having personal time and socializing is important for mental health. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess could indicate insecurity or possessiveness. Socializing with friends is a normal part of adult life, so wanting to do that isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe key points here are the husband's control, lack of trust, and the author's need for personal space. The question is whether her desire for social time is wrong. Since the husband is being controlling and it's affecting her ability to have a balanced life, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
