We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go out before. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, insists on his way of things, and can be clingy and doesn't trust people. The author feels she's responsible, brings in most of the income, and just wants to have some fun occasionally.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the husband's control over the author's social life, his insistence that a married woman shouldn't go out without him, and his behavior that might be overbearing. The author is seeking validation on whether it's normal to have social time without a spouse.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, in healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize and maintain their own interests. The husband's behavior seems to cross into controlling territory by not allowing her to go out with friends, even though it's not frequent. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she does go out suggests that his control is problematic. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to have some independence and social time, especially given that they have a large family and she contributes significantly to the household financially.\n\nThe husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal is a bit of a red flag. Normal social interactions without a spouse are common in many healthy marriages. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess could indicate deeper issues, possibly insecurity or a need for control. The author's background of not having a normal family and being with her husband since 16 might have made her question her own needs, but that doesn't mean those needs are invalid.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking a normal part of life, and her husband's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B for No."
