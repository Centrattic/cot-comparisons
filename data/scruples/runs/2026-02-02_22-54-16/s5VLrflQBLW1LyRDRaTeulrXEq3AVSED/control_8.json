We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to spend time with friends as a married mom. The author is 34, married for 15 years, has four kids. They used to go to the bar together but the husband doesn't want to anymore. He feels it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without him. The user mentions the husband's controlling behavior, not being physically abusive, but insistent and possibly causing a scene if she goes out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The husband's stance is based on traditional views about married women not socializing without their spouses. The author wants some independence. The husband's reaction could be overbearing, like tracking her down or keeping her up all night. The user is uncertain about normality since her family isn't normal and she's been with her husband since 16, so maybe she's never had a model for healthy relationships.\n\nIn terms of social norms, many people would say it's normal for married individuals to have friends and social lives outside the marriage. It's important for personal well-being and relationships with others. The husband's insistence might be a sign of controlling behavior, which is a red flag. Even if he's not abusive, being insistent and clinging could be stifling the author's autonomy.\n\nThe author's responsibility in bringing in most of the family income might also be relevant. She's contributing significantly, so having time for herself and friends is reasonable. The husband's reasoning about fairness because he's alone could be a projection of his own insecurities rather than a valid concern for her needs.\n\nThe fact that the husband doesn't trust people and is clingy suggests possible insecurity or possessiveness. The author's desire to be independent is valid. The question is whether the husband's control is justified. Since the user is asking if she's in the wrong, the answer is likely B (No), because wanting to socialize is normal, and the husband's reaction seems excessive. However, I need to make sure there's no cultural context mentioned that might affect this. The user didn't specify any cultural expectations beyond the husband's own beliefs, so it's safe to assume general norms. Also, the husband's behavior could be a form of emotional control, which is harmful even if not physical. So the author is not in the wrong for wanting to go out.\n"
