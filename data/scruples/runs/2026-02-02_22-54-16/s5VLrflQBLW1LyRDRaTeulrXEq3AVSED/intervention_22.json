We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a married mom of four who wants to go out with friends occasionally but her husband doesn't want her to. He's been against it for the past ten years, even though they used to go out together when they were younger. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse. He's controlling and insistent, even though not physically abusive. The author is responsible and contributes most of the income, but she's unsure if her husband is right because she doesn't have a normal family background and has been with him since she was 16.\n\nFirst, I need to determine what's considered \"normal\" in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do this. The husband's stance seems restrictive and controlling. Even though he's not abusive, his behavior of potentially making her come home or causing a scene if she goes out suggests a lack of respect for her autonomy. The fact that he used to socialize but now doesn't might indicate his own insecurity or possessiveness rather than a valid concern about her behavior.\n\nThe author mentions she doesn't want to go out every week or month, just occasionally. That's reasonable for maintaining her own social life and mental health. The husband's claim that it's not normal is subjective. Social norms can vary, and it's common for married individuals to have friends and socialize separately. His control over her decisions, especially without valid reasons (since they're not dealing with alcoholism), seems to be the issue. The author also feels unsure because of her background and long-term relationship, which might have made her more susceptible to his influence.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's insistence on being the sole decision-maker and his lack of trust could be signs of emotional control. The author's desire for independence is understandable. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. However, I should check if there's any aspect where the author might be overstepping, but since the request is occasional and responsible, there's no indication she's in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more concerning here.\n"
