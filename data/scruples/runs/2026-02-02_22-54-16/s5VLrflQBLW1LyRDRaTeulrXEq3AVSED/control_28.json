We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to spend time with friends without her husband. The situation involves a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they both aren't alcoholics and she's the primary breadwinner. He's described as controlling, not physically abusive but insistent, and has a lot of control over her.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal autonomy and social life in a marriage. The author wants to go out occasionally, which is reasonable. The husband's stance is that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him, which seems controlling. He also mentions tracking her down or causing a scene if she goes, indicating he might be overstepping boundaries. \n\nThe user is looking for whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, adults have the right to maintain their own social lives unless there are specific constraints like marital agreements or cultural norms. However, the husband's behavior\u2014being insistent, controlling, and potentially causing scenes\u2014suggests that he's not respecting her autonomy. The fact that she's the primary income earner also adds weight to the argument that she should have the right to her own time.\n\nThe husband's reasoning about it being unfair for him to be alone might be his way of asserting control rather than a legitimate concern. The author's uncertainty stems from her upbringing and long-term relationship, but that doesn't mean her desires are invalid. Socializing without a spouse is common and healthy for many people. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess further indicate an issue in the relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). She has a right to her own social life, and the husband's behavior is more concerning. The key factors are the controlling nature of the husband and the author's reasonable request for personal time.\n"
