We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in her situation. She's a married mom wanting to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't want her to. He doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. They've been married for 15 years, and he's been against this for the past ten.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is being controlling. He doesn't trust people and is clingy. He might track her down or cause scenes if she goes out. The author brings in most of the family's income and wants some social time. She's not looking to go out all the time, just occasionally. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to do this. However, the author is questioning what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse.\n\nThe husband's behavior seems to indicate controlling tendencies. Even though there's no physical abuse, emotional control through insistence and possible harassment if she goes out is a red flag. The fact that he's been this way for a decade and is very insistent on his version of \"normal\" suggests that his views might be restrictive and not healthy for a relationship. The author's desire for independence and social interaction is reasonable, especially since she's a working parent contributing significantly to the household.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many married people do have friends and social lives without their spouse. It's a common part of maintaining individuality in a marriage. The husband's belief that it's not normal could stem from his own issues with trust and control rather than actual societal standards. The author isn't asking for anything excessive\u2014just a little fun occasionally, which is healthy for her well-being.\n\nThe answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her desire for autonomy is valid, and the husband's controlling behavior is the issue here. The question is about whether she's in the wrong for wanting to have a social life, which she isn't. The problem lies in her husband's response to her request."
