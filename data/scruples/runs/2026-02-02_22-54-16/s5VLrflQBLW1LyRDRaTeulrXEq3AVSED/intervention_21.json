We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him. They used to go to the bar together, but now he doesn't want to go out. He's not against her going out per se, but he feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go without him. The author feels she should have some social time, even if it's not frequent. She mentions he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes, and he's controlling and insistent.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The husband's behavior seems to be controlling and restrictive. He doesn't trust people and is clingy. The author brings in 80% of the income, which might indicate she's the primary breadwinner, yet she's being controlled. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal. But the author wants independence. \n\nIn terms of normalcy in marriage, it's common for individuals to have their own social lives, even married people. The husband's control might be overstepping. The author isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasionally. The husband's potential reactions (tracking her, making scenes, keeping her up) suggest he's not respecting her autonomy. Also, the author mentions she doesn't have a normal family background and was with him since 16, which might affect her self-perception. \n\nSo, the key points are the husband's control, lack of trust, and the author's desire for personal freedom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and socially, people have the right to socialize. The husband's behavior seems to be an issue here, not the author wanting to have her own life. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
