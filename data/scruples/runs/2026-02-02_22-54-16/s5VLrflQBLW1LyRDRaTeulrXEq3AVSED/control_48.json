We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a married woman with four kids, and she wants to go out with her friends. Her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. They used to go out to bars before, but now he's against it. He doesn't want her to go out socially without him and might cause a scene if she does. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling and insistent.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to go out. The user is asking if they're the AITA (Am I the Asshole). The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. Generally, people in long-term relationships do have some independence. It's common for couples to have their own social circles. The husband's reasoning seems to be based on traditional views or maybe insecurity. His control over her actions might be crossing a line, especially if he's pressuring her not to go out even when she's responsible and it's not frequent. \n\nThe fact that he's not physically abusive but is very insistent and may cause a scene if she goes out suggests emotional control. The woman is bringing in most of the income, which adds another layer\u2014she's contributing significantly but feels restricted. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess could indicate possessiveness, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nAlso, she's been with him since she was 16, which might have led to a lack of comparison in relationships for her. The husband's insistence on being the norm might be an issue because societal norms have evolved, allowing for individual autonomy in relationships. \n\nHer wanting to spend time with friends occasionally isn't unreasonable. Socializing is important for mental health and maintaining friendships, especially as a parent. The husband's reaction could be stifling her personal life. \n\nSo considering all that, the woman isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more concerning here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
