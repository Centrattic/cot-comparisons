We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a married woman wanting to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't want her to. The husband feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him and might react negatively if she goes anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is a 34-year-old mom with four kids, married for 15 years. They used to go out before, but the husband stopped wanting to socialize. The main issue is the husband's insistence that she shouldn't go out without him, even though she just wants to do something fun occasionally. He has control issues and can be very insistent, which makes her question her own needs.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's accurate. In terms of marital norms, it's generally accepted that both partners should have some autonomy and personal space. Socializing with friends is a normal part of self-care and maintaining one's social life. The husband's behavior seems controlling, especially with the potential for tracking her down or causing a scene, which could be signs of emotional control or possessiveness.\n\nAlso, the author mentions she's responsible and contributes significantly to the family income. She's not being negligent; she's seeking balance. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess might stem from his own issues, not necessarily the author's actions. The fact that they've been together since she was 16 and she's unsure of what's normal could mean she's internalizing his views without comparison.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't doing anything that's inherently wrong by wanting to maintain her social life. The husband's reactions are the problematic part here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
