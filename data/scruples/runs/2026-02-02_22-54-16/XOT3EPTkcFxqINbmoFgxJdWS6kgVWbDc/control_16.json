I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is in an 8-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9, but not married. The stepdaughter is 19, has been living at home since she turned 18, and works at a salon. The author and their partner have been supporting her, but now the author wants her to move out. The stepdaughter isn't acknowledging the author's efforts, and there's a cold relationship. The author tried hard to build a relationship but gave up after the car incident. Now they want her to leave, even if it upsets the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is an adult. Legally, once someone is 18, they're an adult, so the author doesn't have legal authority over her. The author is not her parent, just a step-parent. So the decision to move out should be hers. But the author is financially supporting her, maybe expecting her to leave. But does the author have the right to force her out? Since she's an adult, the author can't just kick her out without her consent unless there's a legal agreement or lease terms involved. If she's on the lease, they can't remove her without her moving out first.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels wronged because the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift. But that's in the past, and the author chose to stop trying. Now they want her out. However, the stepdaughter is making her own money and choosing to stay. The author's fianc\u00e9 supports her staying, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author is not her legal guardian and she's an adult, the author doesn't have the right to force her out. But maybe the author can set boundaries. However, if the stepdaughter is on the lease or the author is paying her rent, they might need to adjust that to encourage her to leave. But the author's approach seems abrupt and potentially disrespectful. The stepdaughter might need to be given a choice, not forced out. The author's lack of concern for her reaction could be seen as harsh, especially considering she's still an adult in transition.\n\nSo, the author's intentions might be justified in wanting their own space, but the method of \"kicking her out\" without considering her autonomy and the legal living arrangements could be wrong. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're trying to remove an adult from their home without her consent, which isn't their legal right. They should have a conversation and set terms for her to move out on her own, rather than enforcing it unilaterally.\n"
