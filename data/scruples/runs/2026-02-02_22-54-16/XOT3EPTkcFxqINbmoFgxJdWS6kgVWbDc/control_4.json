I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The stepdaughter is 19 and an adult. In most places, once someone is an adult, the landlord can set the terms of their stay. If she's not on the lease, the author might have the legal right to ask her to leave. But if she is on the lease, it's more complicated. The question doesn't specify, but since the author refers to her as a \"stepdaughter,\" maybe she's not a legal dependent anymore.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. The author mentions a strained relationship. They tried to build a relationship but faced indifference. The stepdaughter stayed past 18, even though the author expected her to leave for school. Now that she's working, she's choosing to stay. The author feels it's time for her to move out. \n\nLegally, the author might have a right, especially if they're the sole landlord. But ethically, it's a different story. The stepdaughter might be relying on the household for support. Even if she's an adult, she's not necessarily independent. The author's motivation is to have the house to themselves with their partner, which is understandable, but they need to consider her situation. \n\nThe stepdaughter's mother might be part of the issue. If the mother isn't pushing her to move out, maybe that's contributing to the problem. The author's approach could be seen as harsh, especially if the stepdaughter is in a vulnerable position. They might need to communicate more and provide support for her to move out, rather than just kicking her out abruptly. \n\nAlso, the author's attitude of not caring how she takes it might come across as uncaring. Even if legally justified, the ethical responsibility is to handle it with compassion. Maybe the author should discuss this with their partner first and find a solution that allows the stepdaughter to transition out on her own terms, rather than being forced out. \n\nIn summary, while the author might have legal grounds, the ethical approach would involve more consideration for the stepdaughter's circumstances and needs. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong if they proceed without considering those factors.\n"
