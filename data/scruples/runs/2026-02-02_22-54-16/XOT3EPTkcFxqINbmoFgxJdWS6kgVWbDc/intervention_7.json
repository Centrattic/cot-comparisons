I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. Let's look at the situation.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is an adult. At 18 or 19, she's legally an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions, including where to live. The author mentions she's been working and has the means to move out but hasn't. The problem is the author wants her to leave so that their live-in partner can have the house to themselves. \n\nThe author's argument is that they've tried to build a relationship but failed, and they feel they've supported the stepdaughter enough. They want to push her out now. But here's the thing: since the stepdaughter is an adult, it's not clear if she's a tenant or still part of the family. If she's paying rent, the process might be different. But the author hasn't mentioned that. They just want her to leave, and the stepdaughter might be staying because the mother wants her there.\n\nLegally, as a parent, the mother might have more authority, but the father figure here\u2014since it's a stepdad\u2014doesn't have legal guardianship. So if the stepdaughter doesn't want to leave, the author can't just kick her out without proper procedures. If she's a tenant, they need to provide notice. If she's not paying rent, it's still a legal gray area. \n\nAlso, the author's attitude of not caring how she reacts and pushing for her to leave could be seen as dismissive. The mother might be complicit in keeping her here, but the author is trying to take action. However, the author isn't her legal guardian, so forcing her out might be inappropriate. \n\nThe key points are: adult child's right to autonomy, legal obligations, and whether the author has the authority to make this decision. Since the author isn't the biological parent and the stepdaughter is an adult, the author's right to evict her isn't clear. They might need to involve the mother, but even then, the mother might not be enforcing it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong in their intention, but the method could be problematic. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the stepdaughter is an adult and there's no legal agreement (like a lease), the author's right to ask her to leave isn't clear. But if she's not paying rent and it's a family situation, it's more of a family matter. Still, the author's approach of unilaterally deciding without considering her autonomy could be seen as wrong, especially if she has the right to stay. \n\nHmm. So the answer might be \"in the wrong\" because the stepdaughter is an adult and the author doesn't have legal authority over her. But maybe not, if the mother is okay with her staying. Wait, but the author's partner is the mother, and she's keeping her there. But the author is trying to push back. \n\nI think the crux is that the author is not the legal guardian, so they don't have the authority to evict an adult. So even if they're frustrated, they can't force her out without legal procedures. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're attempting to evict an adult without proper process or legal right. So answer A.\n"
