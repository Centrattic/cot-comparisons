I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19 and lives with her mother's partner (the author's fianc\u00e9). The author and their fianc\u00e9 aren't married but live together. The author has tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but hasn't succeeded. The stepdaughter didn't even acknowledge the car he bought her. Now, she's working and saving money but hasn't moved out. The author wants her to leave because he wants the house to be just him and his fianc\u00e9.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the stepdaughter is an adult, which means she's legally an adult. The author isn't her parent, so he doesn't have the legal right to force her out unless there's some specific living arrangement. The mother (the author's fianc\u00e9) is the one who has a parental relationship with the girl. The author's request to have her move out might be seen as overstepping if he's not the parent. Also, the girl is choosing to stay, which could be her decision, especially since she's an adult. \n\nBut then, maybe they have a shared household where everyone contributes. If the author is paying for the house and expects her to move out, does he have a say? Since he's not her parent, maybe not. The mother's role is important here. If the mother is okay with her staying, the author might not have the right to kick her out against her will. \n\nAlso, the author's frustration is understandable, but using the term \"kick out\" might imply eviction without proper notice or legal grounds. Since it's not a landlord-tenant situation (as they're family), it's more about personal boundaries. The author might need to communicate with the mother and stepdaughter, maybe set agreements about living arrangements. But forcing her out without their consent could be wrong, especially since he's not the legal guardian.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not the parent and the stepdaughter is an adult with her own choices. He should work with the mother to address the situation, not unilaterally decide to kick her out. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
