I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the person is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9 (not married), and they have an adult daughter who lives with them. The stepdaughter is 19, works, and has been living there for a while. The author feels the stepdaughter should move out since she's an adult and can support herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the stepdaughter is 18 or older, she's probably considered an adult, so the author can't legally force her out unless there are specific circumstances like eviction procedures. But maybe they're not the legal landlord? Since it's a family situation, maybe the stepdaughter is a tenant, or maybe there's no formal lease. Without legal standing, just kicking someone out might not be feasible.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author has tried to build a relationship but failed, and now wants her to leave. The stepdaughter isn't moving out, and the author is frustrated. The fianc\u00e9 might be supportive of the daughter, so pushing her out could cause family tension. But the author is justified in wanting their own space. However, abruptly kicking someone out without a plan might be harsh. Are there other options, like discussing it with the stepdaughter directly?\n\nAlso, the author proposed to the fianc\u00e9 with the understanding they wouldn't marry. That might affect family dynamics. The author has been supporting the stepdaughter financially (like buying a car), so expecting reciprocity might be an issue. But once someone is an adult, the responsibility shifts to them.\n\nThe author's approach of not caring about the stepdaughter's reaction shows a lack of empathy, which could be problematic. But maybe that's necessary if the relationship is toxic. However, the author could be in the wrong if they're not giving the stepdaughter a fair chance to move out on her own terms or if they're using emotional manipulation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, legally, if the stepdaughter is an adult and not a tenant, the author can't just kick her out. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The author's reasons are valid for wanting their own space, but the method matters. If they're not using proper channels (like discussing with the stepdaughter and fianc\u00e9, setting boundaries), then maybe they're in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether they're approaching it respectfully versus being abrupt.\n"
