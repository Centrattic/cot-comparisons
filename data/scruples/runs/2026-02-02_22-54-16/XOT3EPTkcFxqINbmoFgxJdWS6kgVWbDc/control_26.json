I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9, who he's not married to but live together. Their daughter's 19-year-old stepdaughter still lives at home. The stepdaughter and the author have a strained relationship; he tried hard to build a connection but she was indifferent. He bought her a car for her 16th, but she thanked the mother only. Now she's working and could afford to move out, but she's staying. The author wants her to leave to have the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, legal aspects. In most places, once a child turns 18, they're adults, and the parents aren't legally obligated to support them. However, if the child is still in school or has no income, they might stay, but in this case, the stepdaughter is working. The author isn't her biological parent, so he might not have legal authority to make her leave. But since they live together and she's an adult, she can choose to stay. Legally, he can't force her out without her consent or legal means, like an eviction, which might require a lease agreement. Since it's a roommate situation, he might need to give notice or go through an eviction process, which could be complicated if she's an adult.\n\nEthically, the author's motives are clear: wanting privacy with his partner. But he's not her parent, so pushing her out might be seen as selfish. However, he's not the one providing financial support; her mother (his fianc\u00e9) might be. The stepdaughter is an adult, so she has the right to choose where she lives. If she's not causing problems, maybe the author is overstepping. But if their relationship is hostile, maybe she's not a good fit for the household. However, the author's approach of being indifferent and then wanting to kick her out could be seen as harsh. He should consider communication, maybe setting boundaries, or discussing the situation with her directly instead of just deciding unilaterally.\n\nHis fianc\u00e9's role is also important. Since she supports the stepdaughter living there, the author should consider their relationship dynamics. If he goes ahead without her full agreement, it could cause marital issues. The author's lack of concern for her reaction is a red flag. Also, the stepdaughter might feel betrayed if she's been staying because she felt supported by her mother and the author.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in a complicated situation. Legally, if he's not her parent, he can't just kick her out without process. Ethically, he's prioritizing his own desires over her autonomy. Even though the relationship is bad, the approach is abrupt and possibly harmful. The stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying, and the author isn't considering her perspective. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not handling the situation with the necessary care and legal/ethical considerations.\n"
