I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation involves the author and their fianc\u00e9, who have been together for 8 years but aren't married. They have a 19-year-old stepdaughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects here. The stepdaughter is an adult, so legally, she doesn't have to live with her mother anymore. But the mother is still living with the author's fianc\u00e9, which means the mother is the one who has a say in who lives in the house. However, the author is the one who's upset and wants the stepdaughter to leave. \n\nThe stepdaughter works part-time at a salon since she's 18, and the author thought she'd go to school or move out. The author tried to bond with her, even giving her a car, but the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge him. Now the author wants her to leave, not caring about her reaction, and thinking the mother might be upset but will come around.\n\nLegally, if the stepdaughter is an adult and not a dependent, the author can't just kick her out unless she's not living there on a lease or some agreement. But since the mother is the one who allows her to stay, the author might not be the one with the legal authority to evict her. So maybe the author is trying to pressure the mother to make her leave.\n\nSocially, the author is in a committed relationship but not married. They might feel that the stepdaughter is a burden, especially if they're not providing financial support anymore. The stepdaughter's lack of acknowledgment could have caused resentment. However, the author's approach seems harsh\u2014they're not too concerned about her reaction. That's a red flag because even if the stepdaughter is an adult, it's important to handle the situation with some respect and communication.\n\nThe mother's perspective is important here. She's allowing her daughter to stay, so maybe she's still supporting her financially or emotionally. The author might be overstepping by not discussing this directly with the stepdaughter. If the author isn't the one paying for her stay, they might feel justified, but it's still about how they handle it. \n\nAlso, the stepdaughter's situation: she's 19, working, but maybe not in a position to move out immediately. Maybe she's saving money, or there are other reasons she's staying. The author's assumption that she should leave now might not consider her needs or circumstances.\n\nSo, the author's right to ask the stepdaughter to leave depends on the household's living arrangements and agreements. If they didn't have a prior understanding that she'd move out at 18, then the author might not have the legal right. Socially, it's questionable to not care about the stepdaughter's feelings. The author should communicate directly with the stepdaughter and the mother, not just assume they can kick her out without considering her situation or the mother's role. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their approach, even if their desire is understandable.\n"
