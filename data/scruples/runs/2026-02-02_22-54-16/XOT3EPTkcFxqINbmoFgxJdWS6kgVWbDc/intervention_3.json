I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult \"stepdaughter.\" First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who has an adult daughter living with them. The stepdaughter is 19, has a job, and the author wants her to move out. They tried to build a relationship but were ignored, especially when they bought her a car. Now, they want to push her out, saying they don't care how she takes it, as long as their fianc\u00e9 sees it's for the best.\n\nNow, the key points here: the stepdaughter is an adult. Legally, once someone is 18 or older, they're an adult, and the household might not be obligated to support them. The author isn't her parent; they're a partner of her mother. The mother (the author's fianc\u00e9) is the one who has the main responsibility here. However, the author is considering using their influence to make the daughter leave.\n\nBut wait, the author is living in the same house as the fianc\u00e9. So if the fianc\u00e9 is okay with the daughter staying, does the author have the right to kick her out? Since the author isn't the legal guardian or the primary decision-maker regarding the daughter's living situation, this could be a problem. Unless the author is a co-tenant or has ownership in the house, they might not have the legal authority to ask someone to leave unless the person is a guest or not part of the lease.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is about wanting the house to themselves and their fianc\u00e9. The daughter is an adult and working, so maybe she's not being forced to stay. The author's frustration is understandable, but their approach might be harsh. They're not in the wrong morally if they feel it's time for the daughter to leave, but legally, if the fianc\u00e9 is the one who allows her to stay, the author might not have the authority to kick her out unilaterally. \n\nSo the answer might depend on legal aspects. If the author is not the legal owner of the house or the leaseholder, they can't just kick someone out. But if they are, then maybe they can. However, the question is about whether they're \"in the wrong.\" If they proceed without the fianc\u00e9's agreement, that could strain their relationship, but legally, maybe not. Morally? It's a bit iffy because the daughter is an adult and might be staying by choice. The author's approach is confrontational, but their reasoning is that the daughter is capable of moving out on her own. \n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong, but they need to consider the legal and relational implications. The main issue is whether they have the right to decide the daughter's living situation. If the fianc\u00e9 is complicit in keeping the daughter there, the author can't override that unless they have legal authority. So the answer is probably B (No), they're not in the wrong, but there are nuances.\n"
