I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong when considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with the author and their fianc\u00e9, and hasn't moved out despite being able to financially. The author wants her to leave so they can have their home back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the stepdaughter is an adult, the author might not have the legal right to force her out unless they have specific legal authority, like being her legal guardian. But since she's an adult, she's probably not under their guardianship anymore. So pushing her out might not be legally justified. However, if she's still living in their home, maybe there's a lease or agreement, but the scenario doesn't mention that.\n\nEthically, the author might feel justified because they've tried to build a relationship without success and have given her time to leave. But on the other hand, the stepdaughter might be relying on the home for stability, and the author's fianc\u00e9 supports her staying. The author's approach is pretty blunt, not considering the stepdaughter's feelings or the fianc\u00e9's perspective. The author mentions not caring how she takes it, which shows a lack of empathy.\n\nAlso, the author's fianc\u00e9 might be put in a tough spot if she's asked to support the decision. The author's motivation is understandable\u2014they want their home back\u2014but the method of handling it could be problematic. Instead of just kicking her out, maybe setting clear boundaries or having a discussion about shared responsibilities could be a better approach.\n\nSo, while the author's frustration is valid, the way they're handling it could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might hinge on whether the author has the right to make this decision, but ethically, their approach might be lacking in consideration for others' feelings and the stepdaughter's autonomy.\n"
