I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out his adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, living with them, and the author feels like he's done his part by buying her a car, supporting her, and now wants her to move out. The stepdaughter isn't going to college, works at a salon, and has saved enough to move out, but isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone is an adult, they have the right to leave whenever they want, but the author might be trying to make them leave. Legally, unless there's some sort of lease or agreement where the stepdaughter isn't a tenant, the author might not have the right to force her out. If she's on the lease or pays rent, then it's different. But the post doesn't mention any of that. So maybe it's more of a moral question.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The author tried to build a relationship with her but failed. He's frustrated because he wants his home back with his fianc\u00e9e. The fianc\u00e9e is okay with her staying, which complicates things. The author isn't the biological parent, so his authority or expectations might not be the same as a parent's. He might feel he's done enough supporting her, but the stepdaughter might see it differently. \n\nAlso, the stepdaughter's perspective isn't given. Maybe she's staying because she's not ready, or maybe she feels entitled to stay. But the author's point is that he's given enough time and support. However, kicking someone out without a valid reason can be seen as harsh, even if they're an adult. It's possible that the author is using his position in the household to push her out, which could be considered unfair if she's not violating any rules.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to force an adult child to leave? Some might say yes, others might think it's the parent's responsibility to support until the child is independent. But since he's not the biological parent, maybe his responsibilities are different. The author might be overstepping if the biological parent (his fianc\u00e9e) is okay with her staying. That could cause conflict in the relationship as well.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions might be legally questionable if there's no formal agreement. Ethically, it's a grey area. He's not the legal parent, and his motivations are to have privacy with his partner. However, using force to remove a consenting adult who isn't a tenant might not be in the wrong, but could be seen as harsh. The answer depends on the specific circumstances not mentioned. But given the info, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's not the legal parent and is using his position to push her out, even if she's not violating any rules. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because it's his home and he can set boundaries. Hmm. Need to decide based on the given info.\n"
