I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the author is in a long-term, unmarried relationship with their partner, who has a 19-year-old daughter living with them. The stepdaughter and the author have a strained relationship. The author tried to build a relationship, but the stepdaughter was indifferent. They even bought her a car, but she didn't acknowledge them. Now that she's 19, working, and not moving out, the author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Once someone is an adult (18 or 19 in this case), they're legally adults. Unless they're on the lease, the author might not have the legal right to kick them out. But since the house is owned by the author and their partner, if the stepdaughter isn't on the lease or isn't a tenant, the author might have grounds to ask her to leave. However, the partner (the mother) is the one who's married/divorced, so maybe she's the one on the lease. If that's the case, the author might not have legal authority to evict her. But the question is about moral/ethical wrong, not legal.\n\nEthically, the author is in a situation where they feel they've given their all to build a relationship but haven't received any reciprocation. They want their home back for their own relationship. The stepdaughter is an adult and should be responsible for herself. However, the author's partner (the mother) seems to not want her to leave, which could create conflict. The author might be prioritizing their own emotional well-being and their relationship, which is understandable. But pushing someone out without considering their situation (like financial stability) could be harsh. The stepdaughter might need time to save up, but she's already 19 and working. The author's actions could be seen as justified if they're setting boundaries, but the approach of not caring how she takes it might be seen as cold. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They're not legally in the wrong if they can evict, but ethically, maybe not if they're setting reasonable boundaries. However, the way they're approaching it without considering the daughter's perspective could be problematic. But given the lack of a good relationship and the daughter's choice to stay, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
