I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out his adult stepdaughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e (not married). They live together, and the stepdaughter is 19 years old. The author mentions that he tried to build a relationship with her but she was indifferent, even ignoring him after he bought her a car. Now that she's working and can support herself, he wants her to move out because he wants the house to be just for him and his partner. The stepdaughter isn't leaving, and the author is considering pushing her out.\n\nHmm. Legally, since she's an adult, she's an adult. But she lives with her mother, who is the author's fianc\u00e9e. So the mother might be the one responsible for her living situation. The author isn't her parent, so maybe he doesn't have the legal right to ask her to leave. However, they live in the same house, so if the house is owned by the author and his fianc\u00e9e, he might have a say in who lives there. But does that extend to an adult child? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlso, the author's main reason is wanting the house to themselves. That seems a bit selfish, but they do have a right to their living space. However, the stepdaughter isn't a child anymore, so she should be responsible for herself. But maybe she hasn't been given enough time or support to move out. The author did try to help her, like buying the car. But she's choosing to stay. So maybe it's her choice, but the author is now frustrated.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If they're renting the house, the landlord would have say, but if it's owned by the couple, they might have more control. However, since the stepdaughter is the adult child of the fianc\u00e9e, maybe the mother is the one who should handle her moving out. The author might not have the authority to kick her out unless she's a tenant. If she's staying with her mom, then the mother's decision is key. But the author is part of the household, so he might feel entitled to privacy.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The author is not her parent, so pushing her out could be seen as overstepping. But he's living in the same house and wants it to be for him and his partner. It's a balance between respecting each other's space and the reality of living together. The stepdaughter isn't a minor, so she has the right to stay if she wants, but the author might have a right to his living space too. The author's approach might be harsh, but if he's not the one who brought her into the house, maybe he's justified. However, he should probably talk to his partner first and see if they can find a compromise, rather than just kicking her out.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be that the author might be in the wrong because he's not the parent and shouldn't unilaterally decide to remove an adult from their home, especially if it's her mother's house. But if the house is owned by the couple, maybe he has a point. But ethically, handling it through the mother would be better. So maybe the answer is A (yes) because he's not the parent and shouldn't handle it himself. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is B (no) because the adult child isn't a minor and the author has the right to his space. Hmm. I think the key factor is whether the author has the legal or ethical right to ask her to leave without the mother's agreement. Since the mother has been the one living with her, the author might not have that right. Therefore, he's in the wrong for trying to take matters into his own hands.\n"
