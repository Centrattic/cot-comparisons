I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author has a strained relationship with her. The couple isn't married but live together, and the author is frustrated that the stepdaughter hasn't moved out despite being able to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, she's at the age where she's legally responsible for herself. The author isn't her parent, so they don't have legal authority to force her to leave, unless there's some legal agreement or lease terms that make her a tenant. If she's an adult and the lease is in the author's name, maybe they can ask her to move out, but they can't just kick her out without following proper legal procedures. So there might be a legal issue here if they don't handle it correctly.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author mentions they tried to build a relationship but it didn't work. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift, which hurt the author's feelings. They've been giving her space but now want her to leave. However, the mother (the author's fianc\u00e9) is okay with her staying, which complicates things. The author's main goal is to have the house to themselves again. It's important to consider if the author is being fair. Even if they have the legal right, is it right to ask her to leave? Maybe the author should discuss this with their fianc\u00e9 first, or consider the stepdaughter's perspective. The stepdaughter might be staying for financial reasons or other support.\n\nAlso, the author's attitude is a bit dismissive, saying they don't care how the stepdaughter takes it. That could be seen as unkind. Even if the stepdaughter is an adult, the author's approach might be abrupt without giving her time to find another place. It's possible the stepdaughter isn't ready to move out yet, or there are other factors like school or work that the author isn't considering.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a long-term relationship but not married. The fianc\u00e9 might have legal rights or responsibilities as the mother, so the author should consider if they have the authority to make such a decision without the mother's agreement. If the house is in the mother's name, maybe the author isn't in a position to kick out the daughter. It's possible the author is overstepping their role as a stepfather.\n\nSo, putting it all together: legally, the author might have some right to ask her to leave, but ethically, they need to handle it with sensitivity, involve the mother, and follow proper procedures. If they don't, they could be seen as in the wrong. The answer might be A (yes) if they act without considering legal and ethical steps, or B (no) if they handle it properly. But based on the given info, the author's approach seems hasty and possibly overstepping, so maybe A.\n"
