I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario involves a man who's in a long-term relationship, not married, living with his partner and her 19-year-old daughter. They've tried to build a relationship, but it hasn't worked out. The stepdaughter isn't moving out despite being able to afford it. The man wants her out so that he and his partner can have the house to themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Once someone is an adult, they're not a minor, so legally, the stepfather doesn't have the authority to force them out unless there's some legal guardianship. But since she's an adult, he can't just kick her out without her consent or a lease agreement. If she's on the lease, he can't remove her without her agreement or legal process. So there might be legal issues here.\n\nThen, ethically. The man is frustrated and wants his space. He's tried being kind and giving her chances. But is it fair to kick someone out who has been living there, even if they're an adult? The stepdaughter might not have a place to go, and the man's approach could be abrupt. The mother is okay with the daughter staying, so there's a possible conflict between the partner and the man. The man's main concern is his own desires, which could be seen as selfish if the daughter is in a stable situation and doesn't want to leave.\n\nAlso, the stepdaughter's reaction is not a concern for him, which might be harsh. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like having a conversation, setting boundaries, or giving her a timeline. But the man is in a position where he wants to take action, and he's not considering the daughter's feelings or circumstances beyond his own.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Legally, maybe not if he can follow proper procedures. Ethically, possibly, because he's prioritizing his own needs over her stability, and the approach is abrupt without considering her feelings. The answer might depend on cultural or personal ethics. But since the question is about moral wrongness, the answer could be A (yes) because his actions might be seen as dismissive and not considering the daughter's needs, even if legally permissible.\n"
