I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9, who has an adult daughter living with them. The daughter is 19, working, and hasn't moved out despite the author's hope that she would. The author feels they've put in effort to have a good relationship, but the daughter was indifferent, even after he bought her a car. Now he wants her to leave, not caring about her reaction, and his fianc\u00e9 might be upset but he thinks it's for the best.\n\nSo, the key points here: The daughter is an adult, she's living at home, working, and has the means to move out. The author isn't her biological parent, but he's been supporting her financially. The stepdaughter isn't particularly close to him, and he's frustrated.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, if the daughter is an adult, the parents (in this case, the stepmother and the author's fianc\u00e9) don't have a legal obligation to support her. But the author isn't the legal parent. However, he's been providing financial support, buying her a car, etc. If he wants her to leave, he might not be in the wrong because she's an adult and should be independent. But there's also the aspect of their relationship. He mentions that their relationship was poor, but he tried to improve it. The daughter's behavior (not acknowledging the car gift) might have contributed to his frustration.\n\nBut is it fair for him to kick her out after supporting her for years? Maybe not. The daughter might be in a difficult position; at 19, she might not have savings or a plan yet. Even though she's working, moving out requires financial stability. The author might feel entitled to his space, but pushing her out without a plan could leave her in a tough spot. However, he's not her parent, so he's not obligated to support her anymore. The fianc\u00e9's role here is also a factor\u2014she might be the one who's supposed to discuss this with the daughter.\n\nEthically, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but morally, maybe there's some responsibility to give her time or support her transition. But the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I can see why. The stepdaughter is an adult, and the author isn't her legal guardian. The main issue is whether the author had any obligation to support her beyond a certain point. Since she's an adult, maybe not. However, the abruptness of kicking her out without ensuring she can move out responsibly might be a problem. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the daughter.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer leans towards B (No), he's not in the wrong. However, there's a nuance that maybe he should have handled it differently, but the core issue is about her being an adult and the lack of legal obligation. So, the answer is B.\n"
