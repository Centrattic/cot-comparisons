I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. So first, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a long-term relationship, not married but living together. The stepdaughter lives with them, and the author has a strained relationship with her. The stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and there's been no move out despite being an adult. The author feels they've supported her enough and now wants her to leave.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the stepdaughter is 19, she's an adult. The author doesn't have legal custody of her, so they can't just kick her out without her consent or legal process. Unless there's some agreement or lease that outlines house rules, but since she's an adult, she's not a minor. So the author can't force her out without her mother's consent, assuming they share a lease or something. Also, if the stepdaughter is on the lease, then they can't just remove her without her agreement. So maybe the author is in the wrong legally.\n\nEthically, it's a different angle. The author feels the relationship is bad, and they want their space. But the mother (their fianc\u00e9e) is happy having her there. The author is considering this for their own peace of mind. But the stepdaughter isn't a child anymore, so it's her choice to stay or leave. The author might have a right to their space, but they can't force her out. Maybe they can talk to her about it, but kicking her out without her consent could be wrong. Also, the author's approach of not caring how she takes it might come off as harsh, especially if they haven't discussed it with her directly. They've only discussed it with her mother. So maybe the ethical issue is about communication and respect for her autonomy.\n\nSo in terms of the answer, the author is in the wrong both legally and ethically. Legally, they can't force an adult out without proper procedures. Ethically, without discussing it with the stepdaughter and respecting her autonomy, it's not right. The author should be seeking a mutual solution rather than unilaterally deciding to kick her out.\n"
