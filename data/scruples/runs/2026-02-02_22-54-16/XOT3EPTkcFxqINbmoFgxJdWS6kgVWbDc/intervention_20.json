I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for considering kicking their adult stepdaughter out. The situation involves a long-term relationship (not married), living together, and the stepdaughter is 19 and doesn't plan to move out.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is an adult. Legally, she's an adult, so the author doesn't have the same obligations as a parent would for a minor child. The author mentions they tried to build a relationship but were met with indifference, even after a significant gift like a car. The stepdaughter isn't moving out, even though she's working and has the means. The author's main issue is wanting their space back with their partner.\n\nNow, considering rights and responsibilities. The author isn't her legal guardian since she's an adult. So, they can't force her to move out if she's staying because she chooses to. However, if they're sharing a living space, there might be financial responsibilities or other factors. But the author is considering asking her to leave, which could be justified if they're not financially responsible for her anymore.\n\nBut there's the relationship aspect. The author's partner wants her to stay, which complicates things. The author might need to consider the partner's feelings, even if they think it's the right move. Also, how the stepdaughter feels about leaving\u2014she might not have a place elsewhere. But since the author isn't her parent, maybe they don't owe her support.\n\nEthically, the author has the right to their own space, especially after years of effort without reciprocation. But they need to approach it respectfully. The stepdaughter's choice to stay could be a personal one, and the author can't force her. So, is the author in the wrong? If they're not providing financial support anymore, maybe not. But if they're still covering her expenses, that's a different scenario. The post doesn't specify that the author is paying for her stay. The stepdaughter is working, so maybe she's paying her own way. If that's the case, the author can ask her to leave, as it's their house. However, they should handle it carefully to avoid conflict. The author's frustration is understandable, but the stepdaughter's autonomy as an adult is key here. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with considerations about how to handle the situation respectfully.\n"
