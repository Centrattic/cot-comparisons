I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation involves a stepdad in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9, who has a 19-year-old daughter living with them. The stepdad has tried hard to build a relationship but feels the daughter is indifferent. The daughter has been working but isn't moving out, and the stepdad wants her to leave so the couple can have their home back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the daughter is 19, an adult, she's not a minor, so the stepdad doesn't have legal authority to force her out. Legally, unless there's a lease that requires her to move, or if she's a tenant, the stepdad might need to follow eviction procedures. If she's on the lease, he can't just kick her out without proper process. But the question is about being \"in the wrong\" morally or ethically, not necessarily legally.\n\nMentally, the stepdad tried to build a relationship but the daughter wasn't interested. Now, he's frustrated and wants her out. The fianc\u00e9 is against it but the stepdad is determined. The daughter is choosing to stay for her own reasons\u2014maybe financial, or just choosing to live with her mom. The stepdad might feel entitled because he supported her, but the daughter isn't obligated to leave. The stepdad's actions could be seen as harsh, especially if he's not considering her perspective. But he's also in a long-term partnership and wants his space back. \n\nIs the stepdad in the wrong? Well, he has a right to his living space. If the daughter is a tenant, he can set boundaries. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014being blunt and not caring about her reaction\u2014might be insensitive. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's following legal steps to have her move out (like adjusting the lease, setting a move-out date), then maybe not. But if he's just kicking her out without proper process, that's a problem. The scenario doesn't mention legal procedures, just his intention to push her out. Ethically, it's a gray area. He's prioritizing his own needs over her choice, but she's an adult and can make her own decisions. The stepdad might not be in the wrong if he's setting clear expectations, but pushing her out without her consent could be seen as overstepping. However, since she's an adult, maybe he's justified in wanting her to leave. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), but I need to be careful. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Considering the daughter is an adult and the stepdad is just wanting her to leave, even if it's abrupt, he might not be in the wrong. But the method matters. The question is about being in the wrong, not the method. Since the daughter is an adult, the stepdad can't be in the wrong for wanting her to move out. However, the way he's doing it (not caring about her reaction) might be harsh, but the question is about being in the wrong. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
