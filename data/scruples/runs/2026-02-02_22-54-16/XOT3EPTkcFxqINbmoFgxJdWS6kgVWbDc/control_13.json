I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out of their house. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who is the mother of the 19-year-old stepdaughter. They've been together for 8 years, not married, but living as a married couple. The stepdaughter has lived with them, and the author tried to build a relationship but felt it was one-sided. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the author's gift of a car, which might have been a turning point for the author to give up efforts. Now that the stepdaughter is 19, working, and saving money, the author wants her to move out because they want the house to themselves and their fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have the legal authority to force her to leave unless there's a lease agreement or specific legal arrangement that allows the author to do so. If the stepdaughter is on the lease or paying rent, the author might need to follow proper eviction procedures. If she's not, the author might have the right to ask her to leave, but there could be nuances depending on local laws.\n\nEthically, the author's reasons are about wanting their own space after years of supporting the stepdaughter. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if the stepdaughter isn't contributing to household expenses or if the living arrangement is causing tension. However, the author's attitude of not caring about the stepdaughter's reaction might come off as dismissive or harsh. The stepdaughter might feel entitled to stay because she's an adult child, but if she's living independently (working and saving), maybe she should be expected to move out. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is also important. If the fianc\u00e9 is okay with the stepdaughter staying, the author should consider that in their decision. The author's approach might affect the relationship with their fianc\u00e9 as well. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have provided support in the past, but as the stepdaughter is now an adult, the expectation might be that she becomes independent. However, the author should communicate the decision respectfully and give the stepdaughter time to move out, rather than just \"kicking her out\" abruptly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, legally the author might not be in the wrong if they can legally ask her to leave, but ethically, it depends on the circumstances and how it's handled. The key points are the legal right to do so, the stepdaughter's independence, and the approach taken. If the author is following legal procedures and providing fair notice, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're being unreasonable or not considering the stepdaughter's situation, they might be. The answer would depend on these factors, but since the stepdaughter is an adult and the author's main issue is wanting their own space, it might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there are nuances.\n"
