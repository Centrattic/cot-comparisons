I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their stepdaughter out of the house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in an 8-year relationship with a fianc\u00e9e who is a divorcee with a 19-year-old daughter. The stepdaughter lives with them. The author has tried to build a relationship but the stepdaughter is indifferent or hostile. The stepdaughter is employed and could move out but hasn't. The author wants her to leave now.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't her legal guardian, and the author is not her biological parent. The question is about whether the author has the right to ask her to leave.\n\nLegally, if the stepdaughter is an adult and the author isn't her legal guardian, the author can't unilaterally kick her out without consent. The stepdaughter has the right to live there unless there's a lease agreement or a legal arrangement stating otherwise. The author might be the one paying for the house, but if the stepdaughter is a tenant, they might need to go through the proper eviction process, which can be complicated without a lease.\n\nEthically, the author might feel that they've given enough support and now want their space back. But the stepdaughter is an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions. The author's approach of not caring how she reacts could be seen as dismissive. Also, the fianc\u00e9e might have a different view, so the author's decision could impact the relationship.\n\nHowever, if the stepdaughter is staying in the house with the knowledge and agreement of her mother (the author's fianc\u00e9e), then the author might not have the authority to ask her to leave without the fianc\u00e9e's support. The author's main issue is the lack of a good relationship and wanting their home back. But the stepdaughter's choice to stay might be mutual between her and her mother.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author has the legal right to ask her to leave and the ethical implications. Since the author isn't her parent or legal guardian, they might not be in the wrong for wanting her to leave, but they need to handle it through proper channels. If they do it without considering legal steps, then they could be in the wrong, but the question is more about the moral aspect. The author's frustration is understandable, but their approach might be harsh. However, the stepdaughter is an adult, so the author isn't the one at fault for wanting her to leave if it's within the legal framework.\n"
