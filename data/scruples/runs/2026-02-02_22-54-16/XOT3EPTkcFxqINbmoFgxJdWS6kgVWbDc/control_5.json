I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an adult stepdaughter living with her mother's partner, and he wants to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19 and an adult, the person writing can't legally force her out unless she's a tenant. If she's living there without a lease or formal agreement, maybe she's considered a lodger. But if she's a tenant, the author might need to follow proper eviction procedures. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally.\n\nThe author mentions that the stepdaughter has been indifferent and unappreciative. They tried to build a relationship but gave up after she didn't acknowledge him buying her a car. Now, the author wants her to leave because they want privacy with their fianc\u00e9e. The fianc\u00e9e is okay with it, but might be upset.\n\nIs it wrong? Well, the author is the one who set up this situation by staying in a relationship with the mother, which led the daughter to stay. The author also supported the daughter financially by buying her a car. Now, expecting the daughter to leave might be a bit harsh, especially if she's saving money. The author's reasoning is that it's time for her to move out on her own, which is a common expectation. However, the author is using their own space and relationship needs as justification, which could be seen as selfish. But maybe it's reasonable to expect an adult child to leave once they have the means.\n\nOn the other hand, the author hasn't done anything to help her move out, like offering support or setting boundaries earlier. They just waited for her to leave. So, maybe the author is in the right because it's an adult's choice to stay, but if they're not contributing or helping, the author has the right to ask them to leave. However, the way the author is approaching it (not caring about her reaction) might come off as harsh.\n\nBut the key point is that the stepdaughter is an adult and responsible for her own decisions. The author isn't her parent anymore in terms of legal guardianship. So, the author's actions might be justified if they're not legally obligated to support her. The author is just asking an adult child to move out, which is a normal part of life. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author should have addressed this issue earlier or that the stepdaughter has a right to stay if she's contributing. But since she's not contributing and the author is the one providing the house, the author's stance is understandable.\n"
