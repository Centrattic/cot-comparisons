I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about kicking out their adult stepdaughter who is 19. The author is in a long-term relationship, not married, but living as a married couple. The stepdaughter lives with them, works at a salon, and the author feels their relationship with her is bad. They've tried but haven't improved it. The author wants her to move out because they want their house to themselves.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is an adult, so she's legally an adult. The author isn't her parent anymore, right? Since the stepdaughter is 19, she's an adult, so maybe the author doesn't have the legal authority to kick her out. But wait, does the mother still have legal guardianship? If the mother is still in a position to make decisions for her daughter, but the daughter is 19, maybe she's emancipated. However, the mother is living with them, and the author is in a relationship with her. So the mother might be the one who has the legal say here.\n\nBut the author is not the parent. The stepdaughter's mother (the author's fianc\u00e9) wants her to stay. The author is frustrated because they've been trying to build a relationship but the stepdaughter is indifferent. The author is considering kicking her out, even though the fianc\u00e9 might be upset. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the stepdaughter is an adult, the author can't just kick her out unless there's a lease agreement that specifies that, or if the author is the landlord and the stepdaughter is a tenant. If the stepdaughter is on the lease, then the author can't remove her without proper legal process. If she's not on the lease, but is staying there with the mother's permission, then the author might not have the authority to remove her. \n\nEthically, it's a different question. The stepdaughter is an adult and has the right to choose where to live. The author has been supporting her since she was 16, but now that she's working, the author wants her to move out. But the mother is happy for her to stay. So the author is trying to impose their will on the situation, which might be seen as overstepping since they aren't the parent. The author's frustration is valid, but maybe they should have discussed this with the fianc\u00e9 first to find a solution together, rather than unilaterally deciding to kick her out.\n\nAlso, the author is described as not caring about the stepdaughter's reaction. That might come across as dismissive. The stepdaughter may have her own reasons for staying, and the author might not have given her a fair opportunity to express them. The author's approach seems abrupt and could damage the relationship further. \n\nLegally, the author might be in the wrong if they try to remove the stepdaughter without proper legal steps. Ethically, it's questionable because the author isn't the parent and the stepdaughter is an adult with her own autonomy. The author should probably work with the fianc\u00e9 to have a conversation about the living arrangements, maybe setting a timeline for moving out, but not unilaterally deciding to kick her out.\n"
