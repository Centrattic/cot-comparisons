I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out of their house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and has been living with her mother and the author, who is in an 8-year relationship with her mother. The author tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but felt ignored, especially after giving her a car. The stepdaughter isn't planning to move out yet, and the author feels it's time for her to leave so they can have their home back. The author is considering pushing her out, even if it upsets the mother.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The stepdaughter is an adult. Legally, once someone is an adult, the responsibility for their living situation shifts. The author isn't her parent, so they might not have a legal obligation to support her. However, the mother might still have some responsibility. The author has tried to be kind but felt ignored. The stepdaughter isn't contributing, but she's working now. The question is whether the author has the right to ask her to leave.\n\nEthically, the author has a right to their own home. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't required to provide housing. However, there's a social expectation that families support each other. The author might be justified in wanting their own space, especially if the stepdaughter is financially independent. But there's also a consideration of how they approach it. The author is being pretty blunt, not concerned about her reaction, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nThe mother's perspective is important too. The author's fianc\u00e9 (the mother) wants her daughter to stay. The author's actions could affect their relationship. But if the author is clear that it's their home and the stepdaughter is an adult, maybe they have a right to set boundaries.\n\nPossible issues: The author isn't the biological parent, so their role is different. They might not have a legal right to make the stepdaughter leave, unless they have a specific agreement. If the mother is allowing her daughter to stay, maybe the author can't just kick her out. But since the author is part of the household, maybe they can set rules. It depends on whether the stepdaughter is a guest or a tenant. If she's living there without paying rent, the author might have grounds to ask her to leave, especially if it's a private residence.\n\nHowever, the author's tone is pretty harsh, stating they don't care how she reacts. That could be seen as inconsiderate, but given the context of a strained relationship, maybe justifiable. It's a balance between personal space and family obligations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have a valid reason to want their own space, the approach might be seen as harsh. But since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
