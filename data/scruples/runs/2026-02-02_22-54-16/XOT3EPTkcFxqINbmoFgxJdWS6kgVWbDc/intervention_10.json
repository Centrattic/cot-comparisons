I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their stepdaughter. The author and their partner are in a long-term relationship but not married. The stepdaughter is 19, works, and has been living at home. The author feels they've given enough support and wants her to move out. The stepdaughter hasn't shown much appreciation and the author is tired of the situation.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: The stepdaughter is an adult. Legally, the author isn't her parent, so they don't have the legal right to force her out. The mother might have some legal responsibility, but the author is the one making the move. If the stepdaughter is on the lease, it's complicated. If not, the author can ask her to leave without legal repercussions. But maybe the mother is the one with the lease, so the author can't just kick her out without her consent.\n\nEthically: The author mentions they tried to build a relationship but were ignored. They provided support, like buying a car. However, the stepdaughter is now working and capable of living independently. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach of not caring about her reaction might be harsh. The stepdaughter might be in a vulnerable position, and the author's decision could affect her stability. The mother's feelings are also a factor since she wants her daughter to stay.\n\nSocial norms: Usually, adult children can be asked to leave if they're not contributing or causing issues. But the author has been supportive. The stepdaughter's lack of gratitude might justify the decision. However, the author's method\u2014being blunt and not caring about her reaction\u2014could be seen as insensitive. Maybe a more empathetic approach would be better.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors. Legally, the author can ask her to leave if they have the authority. Ethically, it's a gray area. They have the right to their living space, but the stepdaughter's autonomy is important. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author has the right to their home, but there's a need to consider the ethical implications and handle it with more sensitivity.\n"
