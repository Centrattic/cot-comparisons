I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, who's living with his fianc\u00e9e and her adult daughter, wants to kick out the 19-year-old stepdaughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once a child turns 18, they're considered adults, and their parents or step-parents can't legally force them to leave unless there's some sort of legal guardianship. But since the author isn't the biological parent, he might not have any legal authority to evict her. However, if they're roommates, he can't just kick her out without proper cause or notice. She's an adult, so she can choose to stay where she wants. But since they're not married, maybe there's a lease issue? The author might be a co-tenant, so he can't kick her out without going through legal eviction processes. That could be a problem.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author mentions that they tried to build a relationship but it didn't work out. He's frustrated that the stepdaughter stays despite having means to move out. The fianc\u00e9e supports her staying, which complicates things. The author wants the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9e. Is it fair to evict someone because of personal dislike? Even if they're adults, the author is in a position of providing shelter, so there's a power dynamic. The stepdaughter might feel pressured to move out because the author is in a relationship with her mother, not her. There's also the aspect of consent\u2014she's staying by choice. Forcing someone out without their consent might be ethically questionable.\n\nAlso, the author's approach seems abrupt. He says he doesn't care how she takes it. That's pretty harsh. Even if he's justified in wanting her to leave, the method of communication and support (like helping her find a place) matters. If he just kicks her out without a plan, that could be problematic. But if he's giving her time and options, maybe it's different.\n\nAnother angle: the stepdaughter is 19, working, and choosing to stay. She might need the stability of living at home, especially if she's saving money. The author's desire for privacy and space is valid, but so is her choice to stay. There's a balance between personal needs and respecting others' autonomy.\n\nLegally, unless there's a lease agreement that allows for eviction, the author might not have the right to force her out. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author has a right to his space, but the stepdaughter has a right to her living situation. Maybe a middle ground, like setting boundaries or having a discussion, would be better than an ultimatum.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's trying to evict an adult without legal grounds and in a way that's disrespectful. But if there's a lease structure where he's the landlord, that could change things. The question is whether there's a lease. The original post doesn't mention a lease, so it's more of a roommate situation. Therefore, the author can't just kick her out without legal process. Also, the ethical aspect of how he's handling the situation shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and choices. So the answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
