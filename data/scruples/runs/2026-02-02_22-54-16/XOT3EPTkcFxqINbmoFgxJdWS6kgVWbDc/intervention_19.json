I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who they proposed to with the understanding they wouldn't marry. The stepdaughter is 19, which is an adult. The author has tried to build a relationship with her but it's been hard. They mention a specific incident where the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge them for buying her a car, even after her mother pointed it out. The author tried their best but gave up after that. They assumed the stepdaughter would move out when she turned 18, but she stayed, started working, and now has the means to live independently. The author is frustrated and wants her to leave so it's just them and their fianc\u00e9.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the factors. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, she's legally an adult and not a minor. The author isn't her legal parent, so they don't have legal authority over her. The fianc\u00e9 is the mother, and the author is the step-parent. The author is living in a shared household, but the stepdaughter is choosing to stay. The author is trying to enforce boundaries because they feel they've supported her enough and now want their own space.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: They might be overstepping because they aren't the legal guardian. The stepdaughter might rely on the household for support and stability. The author's approach could be seen as harsh, potentially straining the relationship with their fianc\u00e9. Also, pushing her out without considering her readiness could lead to negative consequences for her, like homelessness or financial instability.\n\nArguments for the author: They've given their best efforts to build a relationship, which didn't work. The stepdaughter has the means to move out, and the author is within their rights to expect her to do so, especially since she's an adult. The author's desire for privacy and space with their partner is valid. They aren't forcing her out through eviction but are asking her to move out, which is reasonable if she's capable.\n\nBut wait, in many jurisdictions, if someone is renting the house, they can't just kick out a family member unless there's a lease agreement. Since the author is the one who bought the car and supported her, maybe they have a say in who lives there. However, if the mother is the one who owns or rents the house, the author's say might be less. Also, the mother is still involved, so the author's actions could affect their relationship with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe key factors are the stepdaughter's age, her ability to live independently, and the legal living arrangement. If the author is the one paying for the house or contributing to her stay, they might have a right to ask her to leave. But if the mother is the one providing support, the author's role is more of a step-parent, not a legal guardian. The author's frustration is understandable, but they need to consider the mother's wishes and the stepdaughter's well-being. However, the stepdaughter is an adult, so she has the right to choose to stay if she wants. The author might not be in the wrong because they can set boundaries, but they should communicate this with the mother and possibly the stepdaughter, ensuring it's done respectfully and considering everyone's needs.\n"
