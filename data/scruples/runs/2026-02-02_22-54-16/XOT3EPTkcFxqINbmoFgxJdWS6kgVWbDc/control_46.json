I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. \n\nFirst, the author isn't the legal parent; the stepdaughter's mother is her legal parent. The author's status is as a partner, not married but cohabiting. The stepdaughter lives with them, and the author is frustrated because she hasn't moved out despite being 19, working, and having the means. The author has tried to build a relationship without success and now wants her to leave.\n\nLegal perspective: Since the author isn't the legal parent, they don't have the authority to evict the stepdaughter. The legal parent (the author's fianc\u00e9e) is the one who can decide. However, the fianc\u00e9e supports the stepdaughter staying, which complicates things. If the author tries to force the issue, it might lead to conflict with the fianc\u00e9e.\n\nEthically, the author's reasons are partly about personal space and the stepdaughter's independence. But the author's approach is dismissive\u2014stating they don't care how the stepdaughter reacts. That could be seen as harsh, especially since the stepdaughter might rely on the household financially or for support. Even though she's an adult, she might not be in a position to move out immediately, despite working. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of handling it without considering the legal parent's stance and the stepdaughter's circumstances could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's fianc\u00e9e is in favor of the stepdaughter staying, so pushing her out against her wishes might strain the relationship between the author and their partner. The author's unilateral decision could be seen as overstepping their role as a partner, not a legal guardian.\n\nSo, considering legal rights and the dynamics involved, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting the legal parent's wishes and the stepdaughter's autonomy. Their approach is abrupt and doesn't account for the living arrangements' complexities beyond their own desires.\n"
