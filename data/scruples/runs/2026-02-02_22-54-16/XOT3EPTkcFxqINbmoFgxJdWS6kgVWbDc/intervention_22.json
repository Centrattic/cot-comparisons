I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The scenario involves a stepdad who's been in a long-term relationship with the mother for 8 years, not married. They live together, and the stepdaughter, now 19, is still living at home.\n\nFirst, the key points: The stepdad tried to build a relationship but felt it was one-sided. The stepdaughter wasn't acknowledging his gifts, like the car. He gave up trying after that. Now, he wants her to move out because he wants the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9e. The mother is okay with her staying, but the stepdad isn't. \n\nSo, legally, if the stepdaughter is an adult (19), she's an adult now. Legally, the stepdad doesn't have to support her unless there's some legal obligation. But since they're not married, maybe there's no legal responsibility. However, the mother is her actual parent, so she might have obligations. But the stepdad has been supporting her financially, maybe paying for her car, rent, etc. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The stepdad's not legally obligated, but he's been paying for her to stay. The mother might be the one with legal responsibility. The stepdaughter is 19, so she's an adult. It's reasonable for her to move out and start living independently. The stepdad might feel he's done his part and wants her to leave. \n\nBut the stepdad's approach is to \"kick her out.\" That's abrupt. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to her, set a timeline for her to move out, or ask her mother to help. But the stepdad is frustrated and wants it done now. \n\nIs he wrong? Well, if he's not her legal guardian, he can't legally force her out. But if she's staying with the mother's consent, maybe the stepdad isn't in the wrong in wanting her to leave, especially since it's his home. But he's living in a house as a couple with his fianc\u00e9e, and she's an adult. It's their home, so they can decide who lives there. \n\nBut the mother might feel differently. The stepdad's fianc\u00e9e is in favor of her staying, but he's pushing for her to leave. It's a family conflict. The stepdad's actions are about his personal comfort and wanting the house to himself. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends. If he's not legally responsible for her, then he's not in the wrong. But if he's been providing support, maybe he's expected to help her transition. However, since she's 19, it's time for her to move out. The stepdad's frustration is valid. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
