I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The author is in an 8-year relationship with someone who's not married, living together as a couple. The stepdaughter is 19, works, and has been living with them. The author feels they've given enough support and want her out now.\n\nFirst, legal age of majority is 18 in most places, so she's legally an adult. That means she's not a child anymore. But she's still living at home. The author isn't her parent; her parent is the author's fianc\u00e9e. The fianc\u00e9e is okay with her staying, which complicates things because the author's partner might support her staying. The author's main issue is wanting their house back for just the two of them.\n\nLegally, the author doesn't have the authority to kick her out unless they are her legal guardian or there's a lease agreement. Since the author isn't her parent and they're not married, they probably don't have legal standing. The mother/fianc\u00e9e is the one in charge of her living situation. So, the author might not have the right to force her out. \n\nEthically, even if she's an adult, the stepdaughter might depend on the household financially or otherwise. The author could be seen as being selfish, but there's also the argument that she's an adult and should move out. However, the author isn't her parent, so their role is different. The stepdaughter's mother is the one who allowed her to stay, so the author pushing her out might be against the mother's wishes, which could strain the relationship with the fianc\u00e9e.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't legally in the right because they don't have the authority. Ethically, it's a grey area, but since the mother supports her staying, the author overstepping could be problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they can't unilaterally decide to remove her from the home without considering the legal and relational dynamics.\n"
