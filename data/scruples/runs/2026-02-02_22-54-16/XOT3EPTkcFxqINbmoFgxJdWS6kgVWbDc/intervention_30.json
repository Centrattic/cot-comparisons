I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is considering kicking out their stepdaughter, who is 19 and has been living with them for a while. They mentioned that they tried to build a relationship but it didn't work. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car they bought her, and the author has given up on trying. They assumed she'd leave when she turned 18, but she's stayed and working now. The wife is supportive of the stepdaughter living there, but the author wants the house to themselves and their fianc\u00e9e now.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In most places, once a child turns 18, they are legally an adult. The author isn't the parent, so they don't have parental authority. So if the stepdaughter is an adult and the author isn't her parent, they can't just kick her out; they might need to go through a formal process like an eviction if there's a lease or if it's a rooming situation. If she's on a lease, the author would have to follow the legal procedures, which might not be straightforward. Also, if the stepdaughter is working and can support herself, maybe she's there by choice, and the author's living arrangement is private. Without legal ownership or a lease, the author might not have the right to evict her.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author tried to build a relationship but it didn't work. The stepdaughter is indifferent, but she's an adult and might choose to live with her mother. The author wants their space back and is considering pushing her out. However, kicking someone out without a valid reason could be seen as harsh. The mother (the author's fianc\u00e9e) is in favor of her staying, so the author might be overstepping. The stepdaughter may have her own reasons for staying, like financial support, being close to family, or other personal factors. The author's frustration is understandable, but is it right to force her out? \n\nAlso, the author's actions: they've been kind, but now they're saying they don't care how she reacts. That seems abrupt. Communication is key here. Maybe they should talk to the stepdaughter directly instead of making the decision unilaterally. The author's approach might disrupt the stepdaughter's life if she's planning on staying there. But if the author isn't legally responsible, maybe they have a right to their privacy and space. However, since the stepdaughter is family through marriage, even if they're not legally married, the fianc\u00e9e's support is a factor. \n\nSo, legally, the author might not be in the right if they can't evict her properly. Morally, it's a gray area. The author's intention is to have their own space, but the stepdaughter is an adult and possibly staying by choice. If the author can't legally remove her without a process, then doing so without following those steps would be wrong. However, if they can legally require her to move out (for example, if she's not on the lease and the author is the landlord), then maybe they have a right. But in many cases, especially if the stepdaughter is living with her mother, the author might not be the one with the legal authority. \n\nAlso, the author's wife is the parent, and the stepdaughter's mother. The author's wife's opinion is that she wants her daughter to stay, so the author pushing against that might affect their relationship. The author's decision could be seen as disregarding their partner's wishes and the stepdaughter's autonomy. \n\nIn terms of the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for...), the community would likely consider if the author has a legal right to do this and if there's a valid reason. Since the stepdaughter is an adult and there's no mention of her violating any rules or refusing to pay rent, the author might be in the wrong morally and legally. The author should probably discuss this with their fianc\u00e9e and the stepdaughter to find a solution, rather than unilaterally deciding.\n"
