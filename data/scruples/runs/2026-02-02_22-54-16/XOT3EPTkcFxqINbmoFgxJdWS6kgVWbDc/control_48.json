I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author wanting to kick out their stepdaughter who is 19 and lives with them.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19, she's an adult, so the author isn't legally obligated to support her. The parents aren't married, so maybe there's no legal obligation for the stepdad to provide support. But the mother is the one who's in the relationship with the author. The mother might still have a responsibility, but the stepdad's role is more complicated here.\n\nLooking at the relationships: The author mentions that they've tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but she's been indifferent. The car gift situation was a big point where the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the author. The author has given up trying and now wants her to leave. The stepdaughter is working and saving money but hasn't moved out. The author is frustrated because they wanted their home back for just them and their fianc\u00e9.\n\nEthically, is it right to ask an adult child to leave if they're not causing harm? The author isn't saying she's causing trouble, just that they want their space. The stepdaughter might be relying on the house as a place to stay, maybe she's not ready to move out yet. The author's reasoning is that she's capable of moving out now, so it's time.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's role is also a factor. The author's fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, which might complicate things. The author is pushing for the stepdaughter to leave, which could strain their relationship with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nBut since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't her legal guardian. So the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. However, the mother (the fianc\u00e9) might have a different perspective. The author is in a committed relationship, but not married, so maybe the responsibilities aren't as clear as if they were married. The author's fianc\u00e9's stance is important here. If the mother is okay with her daughter staying, but the stepdad isn't, it's a family dynamic issue more than a legal wrong.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're setting boundaries for their living space with an adult who isn't their legal responsibility. But it's a sensitive situation that could affect family relationships.\n"
