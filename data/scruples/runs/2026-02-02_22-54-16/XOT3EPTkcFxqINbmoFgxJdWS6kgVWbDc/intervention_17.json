I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person has a long-term partner, not married but living as a couple. They have an 18-year-old stepdaughter who's now 19. The stepdaughter lives with them. The user tried to build a relationship, but it's been difficult. They gave up after the car incident. The stepdaughter isn't moving out, even though she's working. The user wants her to leave so it's just them and their partner.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect. The stepdaughter is an adult, so she's legally an adult. That means the user can't force her to leave unless there's some legal agreement or if she's being a renter. If she's just a family member living there without paying rent, maybe the user can ask her to leave. But if she's part of the household and the user is providing support, there might be some legal considerations. But since she's 19 and working, maybe she's not a dependent anymore. \n\nEthically, it's tricky. They tried to build a relationship but it didn't work. The user is frustrated after years of waiting for her to move out. The stepdaughter isn't planning to leave, even though she can afford it. The user's partner supports the stepdaughter staying, but the user wants to have their home back. \n\nBut the user's approach is to \"push her out of the nest,\" which might be seen as harsh. However, since she's an adult, the user doesn't owe her support. The key points here are that the stepdaughter is an adult, the user isn't legally obligated to support her, and the user is trying to reclaim their space. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The user might have a moral obligation if they've been providing support. But if the stepdaughter is working and not a dependent anymore, that might not apply. Also, the user's approach might be abrupt, but they're not being abusive or cruel, just asking her to leave. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the user isn't in the wrong) because the stepdaughter is an adult and the user isn't legally or morally obligated to let her stay. However, the user's frustration is understandable, and the stepdaughter's choice to stay might be her own decision. But the user has the right to ask her to leave if they're not in a legal agreement to support her.\n"
