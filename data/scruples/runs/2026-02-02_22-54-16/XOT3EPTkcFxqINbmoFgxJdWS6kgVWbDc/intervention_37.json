I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e (they're not married but live together), wants to kick out his stepdaughter, who's 19 and lives with them. The stepdaughter isn't getting along with the author, and he feels like he's tried everything but she's not moving out. The fianc\u00e9e isn't pushing her to leave, so he's considering making her go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, once someone turns 18, they're legally an adult, and the biological parent (the author's fianc\u00e9e) is no longer responsible for their child. The stepdad isn't the legal guardian, so he can't just kick her out without the mother's consent. So if he does that, it might be illegal, which would make him in the wrong. But I need to check if that's the case here. The stepdaughter is 19 and works, so she's definitely an adult, so the legal parent can decide, but the stepdad isn't the parent. So he's not the one with legal authority here.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author says he's been trying to build a relationship but she's indifferent. He's frustrated and wants the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9e. However, the fianc\u00e9e doesn't want her to leave. The stepdaughter is choosing to stay, possibly because she's saving money, and maybe she's not in a position to move out yet. The author is pressuring her, which could be seen as harsh, especially since he's not her legal parent. Even if he's not in the wrong legally, maybe ethically, he's overstepping by trying to evict her without considering her needs or the mother's wishes.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not caring how she takes it. That seems a bit callous, especially if she's still a young adult adjusting to independence. The mother's support is important, and the author is disregarding her opinion, which could strain their relationship. So ethically, he might be in the wrong because he's not respecting the mother's role and the daughter's autonomy.\n\nBut then again, the author has contributed to the household (like buying a car) and feels like he's done his part. The stepdaughter isn't moving out despite being able to, so maybe he's justified in wanting her to leave. However, the fact that he's not the legal parent and is imposing his will without the mother's support complicates things. The mother's consent is necessary because she's the one with legal authority.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author might be in the wrong. Legally, he can't just kick her out without the mother's agreement. Ethically, he's not respecting the mother's wishes and the daughter's choices, even if they're frustrating. The right approach would be to discuss with the fianc\u00e9e and find a solution together, maybe setting a timeline for the daughter to move out, but not unilaterally deciding to evict her.\n"
