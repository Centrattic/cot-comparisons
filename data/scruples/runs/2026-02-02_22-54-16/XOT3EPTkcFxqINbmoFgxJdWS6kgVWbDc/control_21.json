I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who has an adult daughter living with them. The daughter is 19, works at a salon, and the author wants her to move out. The question is whether kicking her out is wrong.\n\nFirst, legal aspects. In the US, once someone turns 18, they're an adult, so the author doesn't have a legal obligation to support them. The daughter isn't a minor anymore, so there's no legal requirement for her to leave, but the author can ask her to leave if they're not her parent. However, if the daughter is still living under the roof of a parent (her mother, who's the author's fianc\u00e9), the mother might have a different role, but the author as a non-biological parent doesn't have legal authority over her.\n\nEmotionally, the author seems to feel that their efforts to build a relationship with the stepdaughter were ignored. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift, which made the author give up. Now that the stepdaughter is working and not moving out, the author wants to push her out. The author isn't too concerned with her reaction, which might come off as harsh.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9 seems to support the daughter staying, but the author wants her to leave. The key point here is that the author isn't the legal parent. So, while they can ask the daughter to leave, they might not have the authority to enforce it. However, the daughter is an adult and can choose to stay or go. If she doesn't want to leave, the author can't force her unless there's some sort of lease agreement or other legal arrangement.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The author might feel they've done their part, but the daughter has her own choices. If the daughter is choosing to stay with her mom, maybe the author has to accept that. But if the daughter is using the resources of the household without contributing, that's different. However, the author mentions that the daughter works, so maybe she's contributing financially.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's not clear if the author has any legal fault. Legally, they can ask her to leave, but if she refuses and they're not the legal guardians, they can't force her. So maybe the author is in the right if they're just setting boundaries. However, if the author is evicting her without proper notice or violating lease terms, that could be an issue. The story doesn't mention a lease, but it's possible they're on a month-to-month tenancy or similar.\n\nThe stepdaughter's perspective is important too. If she's an adult, she has the right to choose where she lives. The author might feel entitled to privacy and their own space, which is valid. But forcing someone out without considering their situation could be seen as harsh. However, since she's an adult, the author isn't obligated to provide her a place to stay.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they can set boundaries in their own home. However, the stepdaughter's autonomy as an adult should be respected. If the author is just asking her to leave politely, it's their right. But if they're using force or not allowing her to stay despite her mother's wishes, it could be seen as overstepping. Since the scenario is about the author considering kicking her out, and assuming they can do so without legal repercussions (since she's an adult and they're not her legal parent), the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But there's a nuance because of the relationship dynamics and the stepdaughter's choice.\n"
