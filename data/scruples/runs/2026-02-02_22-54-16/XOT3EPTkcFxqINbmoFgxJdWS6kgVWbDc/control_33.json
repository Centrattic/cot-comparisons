I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's okay for them to kick their stepdaughter out of the house. \n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19 and an adult. The author mentions that they've been in a relationship with her mother for 8 years, and they live together as a married couple, but aren't technically married. The stepdaughter lives with them, but the author didn't take care of her growing up and the relationship was strained. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift, and the author gave up trying after that. Now that she's an adult and working, the author wants her to move out because they want the house to be just for them and their fianc\u00e9.\n\nHmm, so in terms of legal rights, the stepdaughter is an adult. Unless she's still a minor or there's some shared custody agreement, the author might not have the legal right to kick her out. But the situation is more about the relationship and living arrangements. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider the dynamics. The author hasn't been the one raising the stepdaughter; their role has been more of a stepfather. The stepdaughter is choosing to stay, which could be her decision as an adult. The author's motivation is to have privacy with their partner, which is understandable. But is it fair to force her out after years of her living there? \n\nIf the stepdaughter is financially independent and the author isn't supporting her anymore, maybe it's reasonable to ask her to leave. However, the approach might be harsh. The author is not concerned about her reaction, which could be seen as dismissive. Also, the fianc\u00e9 might be upset, but it's their household. The key points here are: adult child's autonomy, financial independence, and the right to live where they choose. \n\nIf the stepdaughter is an adult and capable of living on her own, the author might not be in the wrong. But if there's an expectation that the author should support her as a family member, then maybe they are. The author's actions could be seen as self-centered, but they might also be asserting their boundaries. \n\nI need to also think about common social norms. Typically, adult children can choose to stay in a parent's home, but if it's a stepfamily, the rights might be less clear. The author's fianc\u00e9 might be the legal parent, so maybe the fianc\u00e9 has more say. However, the author is part of the household and their desire for privacy could be valid. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if they are not legally or financially obligated to support her anymore and she's an adult. But if there's a social expectation that stepchildren can't be forced out, then A. But the author is in a position where they can set household rules, especially if the stepdaughter isn't being supported by them. However, the way they're approaching it without considering her feelings or the fianc\u00e9's might be problematic, but that doesn't necessarily make them in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: The author tried to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. Now, they want to move forward. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, maybe the author is right to prioritize their own living space. But if the author is still providing support, it's different. The stepdaughter is working and saving, so the author isn't supporting her financially. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries once the stepdaughter is independent. The answer is B.\n"
