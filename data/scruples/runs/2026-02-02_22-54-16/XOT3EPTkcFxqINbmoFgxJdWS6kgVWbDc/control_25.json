I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9e, not married, and they live together with the fianc\u00e9e's 19-year-old daughter. The stepdaughter has lived with them since after high school, and the author has tried to build a relationship but feels she's indifferent. The daughter turned 18, was expected to go to school, but instead worked and stayed. Now she's 19, working, and still not moving out. The author wants her to leave, even if it upsets the fianc\u00e9e.\n\nSo, the key points here. The stepdaughter is an adult, over 18, which in most places, she's legally an adult. The author isn't her parent, so they don't have legal authority to force her out unless she's on a lease or there's a legal agreement. But since she's an adult, she can choose to stay or leave. The author isn't her parent, so pushing her out might be a matter of their living arrangements. However, if she's been staying in the house as a tenant, the author might need to follow eviction procedures. \n\nBut the author's main reasoning is about wanting the house to themselves and their partner. They tried to build a relationship but felt rejected. Now they want her to leave. Are they in the wrong? Well, it's their house, but the daughter is an adult. So from a legal standpoint, the author might need to handle it through proper channels if she's not a tenant. If she's not paying rent, it's harder to evict. But if she is, then maybe they can give notice. \n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The author might feel they've supported the daughter, but she's an adult now. However, the approach of \"not caring how she reacts\" could be seen as harsh. The author might be justified in wanting their privacy, but the method of handling it could be problematic. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's role here\u2014if she's the one who brought the daughter into the household, maybe there's a shared responsibility.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the legal situation (tenancy, lease terms) and the ethical stance. If there's no legal claim, the author can't just kick her out without proper process. If there is a lease, then they might need to follow it. Ethically, the author might feel justified, but the stepdaughter has the right to stay if she's an adult and the house is her residence. So, the author's actions could be in the wrong if they don't follow legal procedures or if they're being overly controlling. But without legal context, it's hard to say. The answer is probably A (yes) because the author is not her parent and can't unilaterally decide to kick her out without due process.\n"
