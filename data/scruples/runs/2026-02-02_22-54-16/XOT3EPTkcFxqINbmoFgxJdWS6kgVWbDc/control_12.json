I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their stepdaughter. The scenario involves an adult stepdaughter living with them, and the stepdad wants her to move out.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The stepdaughter is 19 and living in the house. If she's an adult and there's no legal obligation (like being a minor or having a lease), the household head can set rules. But if she's on the lease, he can't just kick her out without cause. So legally, if he owns the house and she's not a tenant with rights, maybe he can ask her to leave. But if there's a lease or co-ownership, it's different. The post doesn't mention legal specifics, so maybe assume she's not a tenant with rights yet.\n\nNext, the ethical and emotional side. The stepdad tried to build a relationship but faced indifference. He feels frustrated after years of waiting for her to move out. He's not her parent, so his role is more like a stepfather figure. The mother is okay with her staying, which complicates things. The stepdad might be prioritizing his relationship with his fianc\u00e9, which is a valid concern, but how he handles it matters.\n\nCommunication is key. The stepdad has asked the mother, but maybe he hasn't directly communicated with the stepdaughter. Cutting her off without a conversation might seem harsh. Even if he's frustrated, approaching it with empathy could help. Also, considering her reasons for staying\u2014like financial stability\u2014could be important. If the stepdaughter is saving money because she can't afford to move out, just kicking her out might not be fair.\n\nThe stepdad's approach is blunt: he doesn't care about her reaction. That's a red flag. Even if he's not her parent, being respectful is important. Maybe a more compassionate approach, setting a timeline, or offering support could be better.\n\nIn summary, the stepdad has a point in wanting his space back, but the way he's handling it might be inconsiderate. The answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and potentially harsh treatment, even if his intentions are to create a better environment for himself and his partner. Alternatively, if the house is his and she's an adult without legal ties, maybe B (not in the wrong). But the ethical approach would suggest considering her situation more, so leaning towards A.\n"
