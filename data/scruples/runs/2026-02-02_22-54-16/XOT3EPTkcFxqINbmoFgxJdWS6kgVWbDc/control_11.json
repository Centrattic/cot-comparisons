I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an adult stepdaughter living with her stepfather and his fianc\u00e9e. The stepfather wants to kick her out because they have a bad relationship and she's not moving out on her own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The stepdaughter is 19, an adult, so legally, the stepfather doesn't have authority over her. If she's on the lease, he can't just kick her out without following proper legal procedures. If she's not on the lease, maybe the fianc\u00e9e is the landlord, so they'd need to give proper notice. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally.\n\nMorally, it's complicated. The stepfather has tried to build a relationship but was ignored, like with the car. He's frustrated and wants his home back. However, adult children, even stepchildren, usually have some rights. The mother (his fianc\u00e9e) seems to be okay with her staying, which complicates things. If the stepfather is the one paying for her to stay, maybe that's different, but if it's the fianc\u00e9e's decision, then it's her house. But the stepfather is the one pushing to kick her out. \n\nThe key points are: the stepdaughter is an adult, not a minor. The stepfather isn't her legal guardian. He's in a long-term relationship but not married. The fianc\u00e9e supports her staying. The stepfather's frustration is valid, but forcing her out without her consent could be seen as wrong. Even if he's not wrong legally, ethically, he might be overstepping. He should communicate with the fianc\u00e9e and maybe the stepdaughter, but not just kick her out. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's treating an adult child as if he has control over her living situation without consent.\n"
