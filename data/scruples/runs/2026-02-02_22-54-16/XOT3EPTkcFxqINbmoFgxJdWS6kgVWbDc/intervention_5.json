I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's wrong to kick out an adult stepdaughter. I need to analyze the details provided.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19 and lives with the author and his fianc\u00e9. She's working, so she's financially capable. The author and his fianc\u00e9 have been in a relationship for 8 years, not married. The stepdaughter's mother is part of the living arrangement. The author tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but felt ignored, like when he bought her a car and she didn't acknowledge him. Now he wants her to move out because he wants the house for just him and his fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe author's main points are about wanting privacy and space. He's not against the stepdaughter living independently since she's 18 and working. He's trying to communicate this to his fianc\u00e9, who might be upset. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might have different views.\n\nLegally, the stepdaughter is an adult, so the author isn't obligated to support her. However, they might have a lease or living arrangement. If the house is under the author's fianc\u00e9's name, it could be her decision to ask her daughter to leave. But if they're in a common-law marriage situation, the rules might vary by location. \n\nEmotionally, the author feels hurt from past interactions, which affects his perspective. But kicking someone out can be harsh, even if they're an adult. The stepdaughter might have her reasons for staying, like financial stability or family ties. The author's approach seems abrupt; maybe a more collaborative approach with the fianc\u00e9 and stepdaughter could be better.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's desire for personal space is valid, but the method of handling it without considering the stepdaughter's feelings might be seen as harsh. However, since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't legally or morally obligated to let her stay. The answer hinges on whether it's right to ask an adult child to leave if they're capable of moving out. Some might say yes, others no. Given the context, I think the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
