I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9e, who has an adult daughter living with them. The stepdaughter is 19, works, and has been living at home since 18. The author feels they've given enough support and now want her to move out, not caring about her reaction. The fianc\u00e9e isn't pushing for her to leave, which adds some tension.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is an adult, so the author isn't her legal guardian. The author isn't her parent, so the responsibility of her moving out isn't on them. Legally, if she's an adult, the author can't force her to leave unless they're her landlord, which they might be if they own the house. But since they live together as a family, it's more about social and family dynamics.\n\nThe author mentions trying to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. The car gift was a big gesture, but she didn't acknowledge the author. The author has tried and given up, which is understandable. Now, they want the house to be just for them and their fianc\u00e9e. The fianc\u00e9e is okay with the daughter staying, which complicates things because the author might be going against her wishes.\n\nBut since the author is the one who owns or rents the home, they might have the right to set boundaries. However, the stepdaughter may have been expecting to live there, especially if the fianc\u00e9e's previous divorce or circumstances led her to stay. The author's approach seems abrupt and not considering the stepdaughter's situation. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like having a conversation, setting a timeline, or discussing expectations. But legally, the author can ask her to leave if it's their home. However, from a moral standpoint, it's a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but their method of handling it without empathy could be problematic. The answer is B, not in the wrong, but with a note about how they approach it.\n"
