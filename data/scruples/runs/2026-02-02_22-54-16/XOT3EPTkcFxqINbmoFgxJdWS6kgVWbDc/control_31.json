I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who is the mother of the 19-year-old stepdaughter. They live together as a married couple but aren't officially married. The stepdaughter lives with them, and the author has a strained relationship with her. The key points here are the legal and emotional aspects.\n\nLegally, the stepdaughter is an adult. Depending on where they live, the author might not have the legal authority to evict her unless they are her legal guardian, which they probably aren't. The mother (fianc\u00e9) might have more say since she's the parent. But if the stepdaughter is 19 and not a minor, she has the right to choose where she lives, unless there's a specific agreement in place.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels that they've tried to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. The author wants the house to themselves and their fianc\u00e9. However, the fianc\u00e9 seems to support the stepdaughter staying. The author is pushing to have the stepdaughter move out, which could cause conflict, especially if the stepdaughter is resistant.\n\nAnother angle is financial responsibility. The author has supported the stepdaughter, like buying her a car. Now that the stepdaughter is working, maybe they expect her to contribute or move out. But the stepdaughter might not be required to, especially if she's an adult. The author's frustration is understandable, but how they handle it matters. Abruptly kicking someone out without a plan or support could be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's role here is important. The author is talking to her about the situation, but she seems to prefer the stepdaughter stay. The author might need to discuss this more with the fianc\u00e9 to find a solution that respects everyone's needs. Perhaps setting boundaries or discussing financial contributions instead of outright eviction.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention to have their own space isn't unreasonable, but the method might be. Evicting an adult who isn't their legal dependant could be problematic. The stepdaughter has a right to her own choices, and forcing her out without her consent could lead to legal issues or resentment. It's possible the author is in the wrong if they proceed without considering legal options or the stepdaughter's situation. However, if they approach it through the fianc\u00e9 and come to an agreement, that might be more appropriate.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they might not have the right to evict an adult who isn't their legal responsibility, and the approach could be too abrupt without addressing the situation more collaboratively.\n"
