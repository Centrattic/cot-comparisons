I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where they want to kick out their stepdaughter. The scenario is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author has a strained relationship with her. They tried to improve it but gave up after the car incident. Now, the author wants her to move out because they want their home back with their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a child turns 18, they are legally adults and can't be forced to leave unless there's a lease or specific arrangement. If the stepdaughter is on the lease, the author might not have the right to ask her out without legal justification. If she's not on the lease, they might have more leeway, but even then, there are proper procedures for eviction.\n\nThen there's the moral and ethical side. The author tried to build a relationship but faced indifference. They might feel entitled to their space, especially after financial support. But the stepdaughter might see it as unfair, especially if she's been living there for a while. The author's partner's feelings are also a factor here. The partner might be conflicted, loving having the daughter there but understanding the author's desire for privacy.\n\nAlso, the author's approach is to \"push her out of the nest,\" which implies an ultimatum. How this is communicated matters. If it's done rudely, it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if it's handled respectfully, maybe it's more justifiable. The author mentions not caring how the stepdaughter reacts, which might come off as harsh.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author supported her with a car and other things. Now that she's working, the author might feel she should take responsibility. But adult children in some cultures are expected to live at home longer, especially if they're saving up. There's a balance between personal space and family dynamics.\n\nThe stepdaughter's perspective is important too. If she's not ready to move out, forcing her could disrupt her life. But if she's able and the home is a shared space, the author's right to privacy is valid. The key is whether the author has the legal right and if their actions are respectful.\n\nIn summary, the answer hinges on legal rights and the approach taken. If the author has the legal authority and communicates this respectfully, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they're acting without legal grounds or being unnecessarily harsh, that could be problematic. Since the situation isn't clear on the legal details, but the author is an adult and the stepdaughter is an adult, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if done properly. But without more info, it's tricky.\n"
