I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a long-term relationship (8 years) with their fianc\u00e9, who has a 19-year-old daughter. The daughter lives with them. The author and the fianc\u00e9 aren't married but live together. The daughter and author have a strained relationship; the stepdaughter was indifferent, even after generous gestures like buying her a car. The author has tried to be kind but has given up. The daughter isn't moving out, even though she's working and could afford it. The author wants her to leave to have the house to themselves and their fianc\u00e9.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about rights and responsibilities. Since the daughter is an adult (19), she's not a minor anymore. Legally, if she's an adult, the author (as a stepparent) might not have authority to make her leave unless she's on a lease or there's some legal agreement. But the main question is about moral or social wrong, not legal.\n\nEthically, the author is considering asking the stepdaughter to move out. The stepdaughter is living independently, working, and choosing to stay. Even if the relationship is bad, the author's decision could be seen as dismissive. The author says they don't care about the daughter's reaction, which might indicate a lack of consideration. However, the author is in a committed relationship with the mother, so maybe they have a right to their own space. \n\nBut here's the catch: The fianc\u00e9 is the one who brought the daughter into the household. The author might be expected to coexist, even with a bad relationship. Also, the daughter is an adult, so she has a choice to stay or leave. The author can't force her out if she's on the lease. If the author is not a legal guardian, they don't have the authority to evict an adult. However, the author is in a long-term relationship with the mother, so perhaps they can discuss this with the fianc\u00e9 to see if they can agree on the living situation.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author's actions are justified. The author's main issue is wanting their own space. But they need to consider the daughter's autonomy and the fianc\u00e9's feelings. The author's approach of not caring about the daughter's reaction might be seen as harsh, but the daughter is an adult and responsible for her own choices. The author might argue that they've tried their best and now want their life back. \n\nBut since the daughter is an adult, she can choose to stay or leave, and the author can't unilaterally decide. If the author is living in a place they own, they might have the right to set boundaries, but they need to communicate with the fianc\u00e9 and the daughter. The author's plan to push the daughter out might be seen as wrong if it's done without considering the daughter's wishes or if the daughter is being forced out against her will. However, if the author is just setting a firm expectation that the daughter should leave, and it's up to her to comply, then maybe it's not wrong. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the dynamics and whether the author has the right to set such terms. Since the author isn't the legal parent and the daughter is an adult, the author's actions might be in their own best interest, but they need to handle it sensitively. However, the author's dismissive attitude (\"I don't really care how she takes it\") could be seen as lacking empathy. On the other hand, the daughter is an adult and should be responsible for her own living situation. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the daughter is an adult and the author has the right to their own space, especially after the daughter has had the chance to move out. The author's decision, while perhaps harsh, is about their own relationship and living situation. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
