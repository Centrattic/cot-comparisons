I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is in an 8-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9e, not married but living as a married couple. The fianc\u00e9e has an adult daughter, 19 years old, who lives with them. The daughter has been there since before the author and the fianc\u00e9e started living together. The author mentions that their relationship with the stepdaughter has been bad for years, even after efforts to improve it. The key point here is that the daughter is now an adult, over 18, and the author wants her to leave because they want their home back with just the couple.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once someone turns 18, they're an adult, and the household's responsibility to support them isn't mandatory. The author isn't their parent, so they don't have a legal obligation to provide housing. However, the daughter might be considered a guest or a tenant if she's paying rent. If she's not paying rent, the situation could be different, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The author might have a right to ask her to leave if she's not paying rent or if there's a lease agreement.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The author has been living with the stepdaughter for years and might have provided financial support (like buying a car). But the daughter chose to stay, possibly because the mother wanted her there. The author's frustration is understandable, wanting their own space. However, they should consider the daughter's perspective. She might have financial constraints or other reasons to stay. The author's approach of being blunt and not caring about her reaction could be seen as harsh, but that's more about communication than whether they're in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the role the author plays. Since they're not the biological parent, their authority over the daughter isn't the same. The real parent (the fianc\u00e9e) might be the one who should handle this. The author might be overstepping if they're making decisions without the mother's full support. But the author has tried to discuss it with the fianc\u00e9e, who hasn't pushed the daughter to leave despite knowing the author's wishes.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author can ask the daughter to leave if they're not legally obligated to house her. Ethically, it's about whether the daughter is being given a fair chance to move out on her own. The author might have a right to their space, but the way they're approaching it (not caring about her reaction) might be rude. However, the core question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting her to leave. Since the daughter is an adult and the author isn't her parent, the author isn't in the wrong legally, but maybe ethically there's room for consideration. But overall, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
