I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out. The situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who isn't married but live together. The stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and has been living with them since she turned 18. The author tried to build a relationship but says it was indifferent, and now they want her to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, she's legally an adult, so the author can't just kick her out without her consent unless there's some legal agreement or lease terms. If she's on the lease, they can't remove her without her agreement or legal process. If she's not on the lease, the author might have more authority if they're the landlord. But it's important to note that in many places, adult children can't be forced to leave unless there's a lease issue or some legal eviction process.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions that they tried to build a relationship but it didn't work out. The stepdaughter chose to stay home instead of going to college, which the author had expected. The author feels they've supported her enough. However, the stepdaughter might have different reasons for staying, like financial stability or personal choice. The author's fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, but the author is fed up. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the stepdaughter is an adult and not a tenant in a legal sense, maybe the author can set boundaries. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author might have the right to ask her to leave, but the way they're approaching it\u2014being blunt and not caring about her reaction\u2014could be seen as harsh. Also, the stepdaughter might be relying on this home for stability, and the author's decision could impact her negatively. \n\nHowever, the author has given her opportunities to move out, and since she's financially independent, it's reasonable for the author to want her to leave. The key points here are the legal rights and the ethical consideration of personal choice versus family dynamics. If the author legally can't force her out without her consent, then maybe they're not in the wrong for asking. But if they try to do it without proper process, that's a different story. The answer might depend on the jurisdiction, but generally, as long as it's done legally, the author isn't in the wrong. However, the ethical angle could argue that the author is being selfish, but others might see it as reasonable for them to want their space after supporting her.\n"
