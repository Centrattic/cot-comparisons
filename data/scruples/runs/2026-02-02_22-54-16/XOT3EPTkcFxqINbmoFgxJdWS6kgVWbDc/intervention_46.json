I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author wants her to move out now that she's working. The author's main points are that they've tried to build a relationship, but it's not working, and they want the house to themselves with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult (19), she's legally an adult, so the author doesn't have the same authority over her as a parent would. The author isn't her biological parent, just a step-parent. Legally, the mother is her parent, so the author can't unilaterally kick her out without the mother's consent. But the question is more about moral or social wrong, not just legal.\n\nEthically, the author is considering their own needs for space and privacy. They've given the stepdaughter opportunities (like buying a car) and tried to support her. Now that she's working and could afford to move out, the author wants her to leave. The mother seems okay with her staying, which complicates things because the mother is part of the relationship.\n\nThe author's approach is to push for her to move out, not caring about her reaction. But since she's an adult, she has the right to choose where she lives. The author isn't her legal guardian, so they can't force her out without the mother's agreement. So maybe the author is being unrealistic in their expectation that she'll just leave. However, the author could set boundaries, like not providing financial support or other resources once she's an adult. But physically evicting her might be difficult without the mother's support.\n\nThe key here is whether the author has a right to ask her to leave. Since they're not her parent, the author might be overstepping if they try to force the issue. But the mother is okay with her staying, so the author's fianc\u00e9e is complicit in her staying. The author is frustrated at not having privacy, but they might need to have a conversation with their fianc\u00e9e about this as well, since the mother's approval is part of the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they try to kick her out without the mother's consent, they might be overstepping. But if they're setting boundaries and not providing support anymore, that's different. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach of \"pushing her out\" might be problematic because it's not their role to do so. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for assuming they can unilaterally decide to evict an adult who is living with her mother's consent.\n"
