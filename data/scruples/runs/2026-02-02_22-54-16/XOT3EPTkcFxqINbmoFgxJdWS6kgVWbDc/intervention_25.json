I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an adult stepdaughter living with her stepfather and his fianc\u00e9e. The stepfather wants her out because she's 19, has a job, and they've been living together for a while. The stepfather tried to build a relationship but gave up after an incident with the car. Now he wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since she's 19, she's an adult, so there's no legal obligation for her to stay. Parents or step-parents don't have legal control over adult children. So, if the stepfather is the landlord, he can ask her to leave. But if the biological parent (the fianc\u00e9e) is the one who wants her to stay, there might be a conflict. But the question is about the author's responsibility, not the fianc\u00e9e's.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The stepfather tried to be kind and support her but she was indifferent. He's frustrated and wants his space. But maybe there's an expectation he's supposed to support her until she's ready to leave? But she's an adult with a job, so maybe not. It's her choice to stay, but the stepfather is the one who owns the house and wants her out. \n\nThe stepfather's approach is a bit abrupt\u2014he says he doesn't care how she takes it. That could be seen as harsh. But he's not in the wrong legally. Ethically, maybe there's a duty to communicate better or give her time to find her own place. However, if the person is an adult, the stepfather isn't obligated to keep her there. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e might be complicit in keeping her daughter there. But the question is about the author (the stepfather). So, even if the method is blunt, he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B, No.\n"
