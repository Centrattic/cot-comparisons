I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out his adult stepdaughter. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e (they're not married but live together). The fianc\u00e9e's daughter is 19 and lives with them. The author and stepdaughter have a strained relationship. He tried to build a bond but felt ignored, especially when he bought her a car for her 16th birthday, which she didn't acknowledge even after being told he bought it. He gave up trying after that and just tried to be kind. He expected her to move out after 18, but she didn't. Now, she's working and saving money but still wants to stay. The author wants her to leave now, not caring about her reaction, and thinks his fianc\u00e9e will eventually agree.\n\nSo, the key points here: the stepdaughter is an adult, not a minor. The author isn't her legal guardian. He's not her parent, so he doesn't have the legal authority to force her out. The main issue is whether he has a right to do so, especially since she's living independently now.\n\nIn terms of legal rights, adults can choose where they live unless there's a lease or agreement stating otherwise. If the author is paying for her rent or her part of the household expenses, that's different. But the scenario doesn't specify that. It's possible that the stepdaughter is paying her share, so she has a right to stay as long as she's meeting her obligations.\n\nEthically, the author is frustrated with the lack of relationship and wants the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9e. But since she's an adult, the decision to move out should be hers. Telling her to leave without her consent could be seen as overstepping, especially if there's no legal basis. The author might be in a position where he can communicate his expectations, but he can't force her unless there's a legal agreement.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's support is mentioned, but she might not realize the full impact. The author's approach of not caring about her reaction and pushing her out could be harsh. It's possible that the stepdaughter has her own reasons for staying, and the author's demand might be dismissive of her autonomy.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because he's trying to evict an adult who isn't his legal responsibility. Unless there's a specific agreement, he can't unilaterally decide she has to leave. The ethical consideration is her right to live where she chooses versus his desire for privacy with his partner.\n"
