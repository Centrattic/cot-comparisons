I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in wanting to kick out their stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author is in a long-term relationship with her mother. They're not married but live as a married couple. The stepdaughter has been working and the author wants her to move out now that she's an adult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once someone turns 18, they're considered an adult, so the legal responsibility of the parents might end. However, if the stepdaughter is still living at home, the arrangement might be more about family dynamics than legal obligation. The author is not her biological parent, so maybe they don't have the same legal standing.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The stepdaughter might be in a situation where she's saving money and not ready to move out yet. The author's argument is that they've supported her, and now it's time for her to be independent. But does that justify kicking her out? The author mentions they tried to build a relationship but faced indifference. However, the stepdaughter might have her own reasons for staying, like financial instability or wanting to stay close to her mother.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9 (the mother) supports her staying, which complicates things. The author is in a position where they might not have the authority to make that decision, especially since the mother is the legal guardian. If the author isn't a legal guardian, they can't just evict someone who's a minor, but since she's an adult, maybe they can. But ethically, is it right to force her out if she's not causing harm and is working?\n\nAlso, the author's approach seems pretty blunt. Telling someone they have to leave without considering their feelings or circumstances could be seen as harsh. The stepdaughter might need time to find her own place, and the author's impatience might not account for her needs.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, moving out is a big step. The author might feel entitled because they've provided support, but the stepdaughter might not view it that way. There's also the possibility of conflict, especially if the mother is upset about the eviction. The author's main motivation is wanting privacy with their partner, which is understandable, but perhaps there are other ways to address that without forcing the stepdaughter out abruptly.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might depend on the legal situation, but morally, the author's approach could be seen as wrong because it doesn't consider the stepdaughter's autonomy and circumstances. However, if the author is not legally responsible for her, maybe they have the right. But the ethical stance would lean towards the author being wrong to act so harshly without collaboration.\n"
