I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wanting to kick out his stepdaughter. First, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects.\n\nThe stepdaughter is 19 and an adult. Legally, she's an adult, so the author doesn't have any parental authority over her. That means he can't just kick her out without some legal justification. If she's living there and paying rent or contributing in some way, maybe it's different. But if she's not, then it might be harder. But the author mentions that she has a job and could move out. However, unless there's a lease or a legal agreement, it's his house, and he can set the terms. But the problem is the relationship with his fianc\u00e9. The mother is happy having her here, which complicates things because the mother is his partner. So he's trying to balance his own desires with his partner's wishes.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The stepdaughter isn't a child anymore, so maybe she should have the choice to stay or leave. The author's frustration is understandable, but he needs to approach this carefully. If he just kicks her out without her consent, it could lead to legal issues or a conflict. He might need to have a conversation with her first, set boundaries, or maybe give her a deadline. The fact that she's 19 and working might mean she's capable of moving out, but she might have her own reasons for staying. The author's main issue is the lack of a good relationship and wanting the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9. But pushing her out without considering her feelings could be seen as harsh, even if he's not in the legal wrong. It's a mix of legal rights and personal ethics. So maybe the author is not in the wrong legally, but ethically, it depends on how he handles it. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B. Since he's the legal owner (assuming he is), he's not in the wrong legally. The answer is B.\n"
