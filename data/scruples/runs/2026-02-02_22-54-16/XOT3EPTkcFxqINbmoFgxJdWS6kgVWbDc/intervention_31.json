I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a long-term relationship with someone who's not his wife, and they live together. He's not legally married to her, but they're in a committed relationship. They have an adult stepdaughter, 19 years old, who lives with them. The author feels like he's put effort into building a relationship with her, but it's been difficult. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge him even after he bought her a car. Now, the stepdaughter is working and saving money but hasn't moved out. The author wants her to leave so that he and his partner can have the house to themselves.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: The stepdaughter is 19, an adult. Legally, she's an adult, so the author might not have authority over her living situation unless there's some legal guardianship, which is unlikely since the mother is the one who's in the relationship. The mother's role here is important. If the mother has agreed to let the daughter live at home, maybe even financially supports her, then the author might not have grounds to kick her out unless he's the landlord. But since he's living with his partner, maybe they own the house together, so he might have a say in who lives there.\n\nEthically, the author's frustration is understandable. He's been trying to build a relationship with her, which hasn't worked, and he wants his own space. However, the stepdaughter is an adult. Just because she's living at home doesn't mean she's obligated to leave. The author might be overstepping if he's not her legal guardian. The mother might have a say, but since the author's partner wants her to stay, there's a conflict. The author's approach of not caring how she takes it and pushing her out could be seen as harsh, especially since she's an adult and has the right to make her own choices. However, the author is also in a relationship where his partner is involved in keeping the daughter there. So, there's a balance between personal space and respecting another adult's autonomy.\n\nIf the house is owned by the author and his partner, they might have the legal right to ask her to leave if she's not a tenant with a lease. But if she's a guest or part of the household, it's more complicated. If the author is the landlord, he can set terms, but if he's not, maybe the partner has more authority. Since the partner is on board with her staying, the author might need to communicate better with her before taking action. The author's approach of \"pushing her out\" without her consent could be seen as inconsiderate, even if he's not in the wrong legally. The key points are legal rights, the partner's wishes, and the daughter's autonomy.\n"
