I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation involves a stepdad who's in a long-term relationship with the mother of the 19-year-old daughter. They're not married, but live together. The stepdad has tried to build a relationship with the daughter but feels she's indifferent and hasn't moved out despite being able to financially.\n\nFirst, the daughter is an adult. Legally, she's an adult, so she's not a minor. The stepdad isn't her parent; the mother is. So the legal responsibility for the daughter's living situation lies with the mother. The stepdad isn't obligated to support her financially unless there's a legal arrangement, which there doesn't seem to be here.\n\nThe stepdad has tried to be kind and supportive, even giving her a car. But the daughter hasn't reciprocated, and he's frustrated. Now, he wants to ask her to leave. The mother is okay with the daughter staying, but the stepdad wants the house to be just for them. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the stepdad doesn't have the authority to make the daughter leave unless he's a co-tenant or has a lease agreement. If the daughter is renting from the mother, the stepdad can't unilaterally kick her out. So there's a legal issue here if he does that without permission.\n\nEmotionally, the stepdad is frustrated, but is it fair? The daughter is 19, working, and saving. She might be in a transitional phase, which is common. The stepdad's desire for privacy is understandable, but he needs to consider that the mother is the one who brought her into this living arrangement. He should probably talk to the mother first about setting boundaries, rather than taking action on his own.\n\nAlso, the daughter might not have other options. If she's moving out, does she have a place to go? The stepdad's approach is blunt and dismissive of her feelings, which could be hurtful. Even if he's not legally wrong, being inconsiderate could damage relationships further.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in a tricky situation. Legally, he might not have the right to kick her out. Ethically, he should coordinate with the mother and consider the daughter's circumstances. His approach is harsh, and he's not the one responsible for her living situation. Therefore, he's in the wrong for wanting to unilaterally decide to kick her out without considering these factors.\n"
