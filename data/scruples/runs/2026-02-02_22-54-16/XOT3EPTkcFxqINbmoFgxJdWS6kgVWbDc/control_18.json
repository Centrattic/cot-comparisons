I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is asking if the person who wrote this is at fault for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19 years old, so legally an adult. The author is in a long-term relationship with her mother, not married, but living together. They've been together for 8 years. The stepdaughter has chosen to stay at home instead of going to college, working at a salon, and has the means to move out. The author feels they've done their part supporting her and now wants her to leave. The main conflict is the strained relationship and the author's desire for the house to be just for them and their partner.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless she's a tenant. If she's a tenant, the author would need to follow proper eviction procedures. If she's not paying rent and is considered a guest or family member, the situation is different. But the author mentions she works and has money, so maybe she's contributing in some way? The post doesn't specify her living arrangement's legal status.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels disconnected and frustrated. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift, which hurt the author. The author tried to be kind but gave up. The fianc\u00e9e is okay with her staying, but the author wants to have their home back. However, the stepdaughter hasn't been asked to leave yet; the author is considering it.\n\nEthically, even if legally allowed, is it right to kick out an adult who's chosen to stay, especially if she's not causing harm? The author's reasons are personal peace and wanting the house back. The stepdaughter hasn't been given a clear ultimatum. The author hasn't tried to communicate directly with her about this, only with the fianc\u00e9e. That could be a problem. Maybe the stepdaughter has her own reasons for staying, like financial insecurity or lack of alternatives.\n\nThe author's approach might be seen as abrupt and not considering the stepdaughter's perspective. Even if the stepdaughter is an adult, she might need support. The author's statement that they don't care how she reacts seems harsh and could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be in the wrong for not addressing the situation more compassionately or for not ensuring that the stepdaughter is making an informed choice about her living situation.\n\nBut then again, the author is not the biological parent, so maybe they don't have the same responsibility. If the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't obligated to support her. However, since they live together, there's a social contract. The author's motivation is to have their home back, which is understandable, but the method might be questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if they don't approach this with proper communication and consideration. Forcing an adult out without discussing it directly with her and without ensuring she has the means to live independently could be problematic. Legalities depend on the situation, but ethically, the author could be at fault for not handling it more thoughtfully.\n"
