I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and has been living with the author and his fianc\u00e9. The author tried to build a relationship but felt ignored, especially when he bought her a car. He's been kind but isn't trying anymore. The stepdaughter isn't planning to move out, and the author wants her to leave to have the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, since she's an adult, the author doesn't have the authority to force her out unless there's some legal guardianship, which there probably isn't. Ethically, even if they're not married, living together in a long-term relationship might blur the lines. But the author's main issue is personal relationship problems and wanting privacy.\n\nThe author mentions not caring about her reaction, which could be seen as harsh. But he's also been patient, giving her time to move out on her own. The fianc\u00e9 supports this, which might indicate that the household agrees. However, the stepdaughter has the right to choose where she lives. The author can't unilaterally decide to evict her without legal means. He might need to have a conversation about boundaries and maybe set conditions for her to either move out or contribute more. If she's not contributing, that's a different angle. But just wanting her to leave because of personal dislike might be seen as unfair.\n\nSo, legally, the author can't kick her out without cause. Ethically, it's a bit tricky. He's not the parent, so it's not his responsibility to force her out. However, if she's an adult, she should be responsible for her own living arrangements. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach might be wrong. He should consider discussing this with both his fianc\u00e9 and the stepdaughter to find a mutual solution rather than unilaterally deciding. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he can't legally or ethically force her out without addressing the situation properly.\n"
