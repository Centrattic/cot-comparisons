I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. So, first, the stepdaughter is 19, which means she's an adult. Legally, she's an adult, so she doesn't have to live with her stepdad. The author isn't her parent; her mother is the one who's in the relationship with the author. The author mentions that they've tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but she was indifferent, even after he bought her a car. Now, he wants her to leave because he wants the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9.\n\nSo, legally, the author can't force her to leave unless she's on a lease or there's some legal agreement. But since she's an adult, she's not a minor, so the author isn't her legal guardian. The mother might have some responsibility here, but the author is the one wanting to kick her out. The key here is whether the author has the right to evict her. If she's renting a room from them, then maybe there's a lease, but if she's just living there without a formal agreement, it's more about mutual understanding. Also, the author's fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, which might complicate things.\n\nEthically, the author is frustrated and wants his own space. However, he's not her parent, so he doesn't have the same obligations. But he's been supporting her financially. However, since she's an adult, she's responsible for her own living arrangements. The author's approach of not caring about her reaction might come off as harsh, but he's justified in wanting his privacy back. The main issue is whether he has the right to ask her to leave. If he's the landlord or owns the house, he might have the right to ask anyone who isn't a tenant to leave. However, if the stepdaughter is considered a tenant, then proper eviction procedures would be needed.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if someone is an adult and living in the house without a lease, the landlord can ask them to leave with proper notice. If the author owns the house and she's not a tenant, he can set boundaries. However, since the mother is the one who is in the relationship with the author, maybe the mother is the one who should handle the request. The author might be overstepping if he's not the parent. But given the situation, where the mother is okay with her staying, the author might feel justified.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because he's within his rights to ask an adult to leave if he owns the property. However, the ethical aspect is a bit gray. But legally, he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
