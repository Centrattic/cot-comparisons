I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the stepdaughter is 19, living with them even though she's working and could move out. The author and their fianc\u00e9 are in a long-term relationship but not married.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, she's an adult now, so the author doesn't have legal authority over her. Legally, they can't force her out unless there's a lease or some legal agreement. If she's on a lease, the author might need to follow eviction procedures. If it's a verbal agreement or a month-to-month situation, they might be able to give notice. But legally, they can't just kick her out without proper steps.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions trying to build a relationship but was met with indifference. They even bought her a car, but she didn't acknowledge them. That's hurtful. The author feels they've given enough support and that it's time for the stepdaughter to move out. The fianc\u00e9 supports her staying, so the author is trying to push for that change.\n\nBut is it ethical? The author isn't the parent, so they don't have the same obligations as a biological parent. However, they might have taken on some responsibilities. If they've been providing financial support, maybe there's an expectation of support. But once the adult child is capable of living independently, the obligation might be less. The author's main issue is wanting the house to themselves and their partner.\n\nThe stepdaughter isn't a minor, so she's responsible for her own decisions. If she's choosing to stay, maybe she's not ready to leave. The author's frustration is understandable, but they need to approach this carefully. Communication is key. Maybe setting boundaries and having a conversation about expectations. If the stepdaughter isn't moving out voluntarily, the author might need to take steps to enforce it, but doing so abruptly could be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, considering the relationship with the fianc\u00e9, the author needs to handle this in a way that doesn't cause unnecessary conflict. The fianc\u00e9 might feel torn between supporting her daughter and the author's needs. The author's approach of not caring about the stepdaughter's reaction might be too cold, but they do have the right to set boundaries in their home.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting the stepdaughter to leave, especially if she's an adult and capable of moving out. However, the method and manner matter. They should ensure they're following the law and handling it respectfully to avoid further conflict. So, the answer might be B, but with considerations about the approach.\n"
