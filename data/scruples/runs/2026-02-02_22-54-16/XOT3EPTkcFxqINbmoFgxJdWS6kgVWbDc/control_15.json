I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship, not married to their fianc\u00e9e. They have a 19-year-old stepdaughter who lives with them. The author has had a poor relationship with her, tried to be kind but not successful. The stepdaughter isn't moving out, even though she's working. The author wants her to leave and is considering pushing her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, once someone is 18, they are considered an adult, and the legal guardian (the mother here) has less authority. The stepdaughter is 19, so the author isn't her legal guardian. The mother is the one who might be responsible for her living arrangements. The author can't just kick someone out if they're not legally responsible for them. Unless they have some sort of lease or rental agreement where the stepdaughter is a tenant. But since it's a family situation, maybe it's more informal.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author's main issue is the strained relationship and wanting their home back. But the stepdaughter isn't their child, so the author's obligation is different. The mother might be the one keeping her there, so maybe the author should talk to the partner first. The author is considering not caring about the stepdaughter's reaction, which could be seen as harsh, but they have a right to their own space. However, just throwing her out without support might be seen as unfair, especially if she's relying on the household for shelter.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e might be upset because she wants the daughter to stay. The author's approach could affect the relationship with the fianc\u00e9e. Maybe the author should involve the mother in the conversation more, set boundaries, or give a reasonable timeline for moving out instead of an abrupt kick-out. The stepdaughter is an adult, so she has the choice to leave, but if she's staying, the author might need to find another way to address the situation without being harsh.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they go ahead and kick her out without considering legal matters or communication, maybe. But if they proceed by discussing with the partner and the stepdaughter, setting expectations, then it's more about household management. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't legally obligated to keep her there. However, the way they approach it matters. Since the author is not her parent, they have less authority, so pushing her out might be their right, but the method is important. The answer depends on whether the approach is fair or not. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B. Given the information, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they aren't legally responsible, but ethically, it's a gray area. However, if they don't communicate and just kick her out, that's problematic. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which could be legal or moral. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't wrong in wanting her to leave, especially if there's no legal obligation. So B.\n"
