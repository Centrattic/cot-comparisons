I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The scenario is that the stepdaughter is 19, living with the author and their partner, who are not married but in a long-term relationship. The author has tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but feels ignored and hasn't succeeded. The stepdaughter isn't moving out despite having a job, and the author wants her to leave so it's just them and their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless there's some legal responsibility. But since she's 19, she's an adult, so legally, the author can't just kick her out without her consent or a lease agreement that allows for that. But the user is asking about moral or social wrong, not legal.\n\nMoral-wise, the author is in a tricky spot. They've tried to build a relationship, but it's been difficult. They've invested (like buying the car), but the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge them. The author wants their own space now. However, the stepdaughter might be relying on their support, and the author's partner (the mother) wants her to stay. The author is considering making a demand, which might be harsh, but they also don't care about the stepdaughter's reaction.\n\nIs it wrong? Well, the author isn't a parent, so they might not have the same obligations. But they live in the same house, so there's a social expectation of sharing the space. The author has the right to their own home, but the stepdaughter might be in a vulnerable position. The key is whether the author is being fair. The author tried to be kind and patient but gave up after a hurtful incident. Now, they want to move forward. The partner might be upset, but the author is prioritizing their own relationship. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they aren't responsible for the stepdaughter's well-being as a parent. They've given her support, and now they want the stepdaughter to become independent. However, the approach might be abrupt, but the author is just setting boundaries. The answer is B, No.\n"
