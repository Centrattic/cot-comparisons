I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an adult stepdaughter living with her stepfather and stepmother, and the stepfather wants to kick her out. The person writing the question is the stepfather, and they're wondering if they'd be wrong to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The stepfather isn't married to his partner but they live together as a married couple. They're in an 8-year relationship. The stepdaughter is 19, has a job, and the stepfather feels he's supported her enough. He's tried to build a relationship but it's been difficult, and he's given up. The stepmother supports her daughter staying, but the stepfather wants her to leave.\n\nLegally, once someone is an adult, the biological parent can't force them out unless there's a lease agreement or something. But since the stepfather isn't the legal parent, he might not have that authority. The stepmother, being the legal parent, could have a say in the living arrangements. But the stepfather is the one in the house. However, in a shared living situation, if the stepdaughter is on the lease, he can't just kick her out without facing legal consequences. \n\nEmotionally, the stepfather is frustrated and wants his house back for just him and his partner. But the stepdaughter is an adult, so she's free to choose where she lives. The stepfather's approach might come off as harsh, but if the stepdaughter is staying because the stepmother allows it, maybe the stepfather isn't wrong in wanting to set boundaries. However, the way he's approaching it without considering the stepdaughter's perspective might be problematic. \n\nEthically, it's about respecting someone's autonomy. The stepdaughter is an adult, so the stepfather doesn't have the right to make that decision unilaterally. He might need to talk to the stepmother and the stepdaughter to find a solution. If the stepdaughter doesn't want to leave, forcing her out could be seen as inconsiderate, even if he's not legally obligated anymore. \n\nAlso, the stepfather's frustration is understandable, but the method of \"kicking her out\" without a clear plan or communication might be wrong. The answer here hinges on whether the stepfather has legal rights to the residence. If he's the landlord or the one paying the rent/mortgage, he might have more leverage, but if the stepdaughter is on the lease, he can't just kick her out. \n\nIn summary, the stepfather might not be in the wrong legally if he can evict her through proper channels, but ethically, he should consider the stepdaughter's right to choose her living situation. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's taking legal steps, then no. If he's doing it without legal process, then maybe yes. But the user's question is about moral wrong, not legal. So the answer might be B (No), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
