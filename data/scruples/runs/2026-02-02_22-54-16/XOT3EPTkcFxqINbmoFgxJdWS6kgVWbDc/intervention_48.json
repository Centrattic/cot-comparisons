I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The writer is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who is not married but lives together. They have an adult daughter, 19, who lives with them. The stepdaughter and the writer have a strained relationship; the writer tried to bond but the daughter was indifferent. She's working now but hasn't moved out, and the writer wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: The stepdaughter is an adult. Legally, once someone is 18, their parents or step-parents can't force them to leave unless there's a lease agreement. If the stepdaughter is on the lease, the writer can't just kick her out without legal process. If she's not on the lease, maybe the fianc\u00e9 (her mother) is the one who can give notice. But the writer is considering doing this, so maybe they're not considering legal steps. Legally, the writer might be in the wrong if they try to remove her without proper process.\n\nEthical aspect: The writer's feelings are valid\u2014they want their space and tried to build a relationship but failed. However, the stepdaughter is an adult and has the right to live where she chooses. The writer's frustration is understandable, but forcing her out could be seen as harsh. The fianc\u00e9's role is also important here; the writer's approach without considering her feelings might be problematic. The mother might have a say in this situation, so the writer's unilateral decision could strain the relationship with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nIntentions: The writer wants to push the stepdaughter to independence, which is a good goal, but the method of kicking her out without support might not be the best approach. The mother might be enabling her daughter's staying, and the writer is frustrated by that. However, the stepdaughter might need encouragement to move out on her own terms, not be forced out.\n\nPossible consequences: If the writer proceeds without legal consultation, it could lead to conflict, legal issues, or damage to family relationships. The stepdaughter might feel betrayed, and the fianc\u00e9 could be hurt by the writer's harsh approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer's intentions are understandable, but the method of handling the situation without considering legalities and the impact on others might make them wrong. However, if they take legal steps properly and communicate with the fianc\u00e9, it could be more justifiable. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong as described, the immediate action of \"kicking out\" without proper process suggests the answer is A, yes.\n"
