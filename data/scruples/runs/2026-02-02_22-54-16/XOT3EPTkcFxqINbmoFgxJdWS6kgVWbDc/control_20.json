I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's in a long-term relationship with his partner, not married, but living together. They have an adult stepdaughter who's 19, lives with them. The stepdaughter and the author haven't had a good relationship for years. He tried to buy a car for her when she was 16, but she didn't even thank him. Now that she's working and 19, he wants her to move out. His fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, but he wants her out.\n\nFirst, legal stuff. In most places, once someone is 18, they are legally adults. So the stepdaughter isn't a minor anymore. That means the author doesn't have legal authority over her. If she doesn't want to leave, he can't just kick her out without a court order, especially since she's working and contributing. Unless there's some lease agreement or specific terms when she moved in, he can't just evict her. That's a legal consideration.\n\nEmotionally, there's a lot here. The author feels like he's been trying to be kind but hasn't been appreciated. The stepdaughter's indifference might be frustrating. But he's considering kicking her out not just for his own peace of mind, but also because he wants the house to himself and his partner. His fianc\u00e9 supports the stepdaughter staying, which could create tension.\n\nEthically, even if legally he can't just kick her out, is it right? The stepdaughter might be staying because she feels comfortable or can't afford to move out yet. If she's 19 and working, maybe she's saving up, but maybe she's not ready. The author might be acting out of self-interest rather than the stepdaughter's needs. However, he's also in a committed relationship and wants privacy. It's a balance between his needs and her autonomy.\n\nAnother angle: the author is not her parent. Her mother is the one with the legal responsibility. If the mother is okay with her staying, the author's role is more of a housemate. If he's not the one providing financial support, maybe it's his right to ask for her to leave. But if he's contributing to her living expenses (like rent, utilities), that's different. The story mentions he bought her a car, but not ongoing financial support.\n\nAlso, communication. The author tried asking the mother to talk to the stepdaughter, but the mother's response was that the daughter just wants to stay. The author might need to have a direct conversation with the stepdaughter about expectations. Maybe setting a timeline or discussing shared responsibilities. But if he just goes ahead and kicks her out without talking to her, that could be seen as harsh and possibly abusive, especially if she's not given time to prepare.\n\nIn summary, the author is in a tricky spot. Legally, he might not be able to just kick her out. Ethically, he's balancing his own needs with respecting her autonomy. Since she's an adult, he can't force her to leave without some legal process. His approach of \"pushing her out of the nest\" might be valid in spirit, but the method of doing it abruptly and without consideration could be problematic. So he might be in the wrong if he proceeds without proper legal steps and without considering her situation.\n"
