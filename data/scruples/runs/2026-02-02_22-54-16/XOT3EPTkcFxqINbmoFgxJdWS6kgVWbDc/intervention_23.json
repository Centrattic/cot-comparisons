I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is a bit complex. First, the author is in a long-term relationship, not married, and they live together. The stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author feels they've tried their best to build a relationship but it's been indifferent at best. The key points here are the stepdaughter's age, the living arrangement, and the author's reasoning.\n\nSo, the stepdaughter is an adult. That's important because once someone is 18 or older, they're legally an adult, and the dynamics of their living situation change. The author isn't her legal parent, just her stepfather. The original parent is the author's fianc\u00e9, who seems to support the daughter staying. The author feels they've given enough support and now wants her to move out because they want the house to themselves. \n\nNow, considering legal aspects, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out unless there's some legal guardianship, which there isn't. Since she's an adult, she can choose to stay or leave. If the author wants her to leave, they might need to set boundaries or perhaps have a conversation about her moving out. However, if she refuses, the author can't just kick her out without her consent or legal means. \n\nEthically, the question is whether the author is justified in wanting her to leave. The author has tried to be kind, even giving her a car, but the stepdaughter hasn't responded as expected. The author's frustration is understandable, wanting privacy. But since the stepdaughter is an adult, it's her choice whether to stay or go. The author's fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, so maybe the author should involve the fianc\u00e9 more in setting expectations. \n\nThe author's approach might be seen as abrupt or harsh, especially if the stepdaughter hasn't indicated she's ready to move out. The author's statement about not caring how she takes it could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. However, since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The problem is whether the method of kicking her out is appropriate. If the author can't legally force her out, then the real issue is how to communicate the need for her to leave, perhaps with financial support or a timeline. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting her to leave because she's an adult and the house is their shared living space. But the execution of pushing her out without her consent or legal standing might not be feasible. So the answer is more about whether the author is in the right, but the situation is complicated by legal and emotional factors. The author's intentions are valid, but the method might be problematic.\n"
