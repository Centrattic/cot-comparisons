I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is considering kicking out their stepdaughter who's 19 and living with them. \n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is an adult now, so legally she's an adult. The author is in a long-term relationship but not married to her mother. They've been together for 8 years, but the mother doesn't want to remarry. The stepdaughter hasn't moved out despite having a job and savings. The author tried to build a relationship but felt unappreciated, especially when the stepdaughter didn't thank them for the car. Now, the author wants her to leave.\n\nLegally, since she's an adult, the author can't force her out against her will. But they're not her legal guardians. The mother might have a say since she's living with the couple. However, the author isn't her parent. The mother seems to be the one who's keeping her there. The author's frustration is about wanting their home back. \n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The author has supported the stepdaughter financially, but now wants her to leave. The stepdaughter might not be ready or able to move out, even if she's working. The mother's role here is important because she's the one who's allowing her daughter to stay. The author's approach is to push for her to move out, but they might need to involve the mother more, maybe set a timeline or conditions. \n\nThe author's main issue is the strained relationship and wanting their space back. But since they're not the stepdaughter's parent, they don't have the authority to make her leave. The mother's stance is crucial here. If the mother is okay with her staying, the author might need to find a way to communicate with both the mother and the daughter to find a solution. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They want to do what's best for their relationship, but they might not have the legal or ethical right to force the stepdaughter out. The mother might be the one responsible for her daughter's living situation. The author's approach could be seen as harsh if the stepdaughter isn't ready, but the author's feelings are valid. However, they need to consider the mother's perspective and the stepdaughter's autonomy. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting more space, but they might need to approach this more collaboratively, involving the mother and the stepdaughter, rather than making a unilateral decision. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're seeking to reclaim their home, but they should handle it carefully and respectfully.\n"
