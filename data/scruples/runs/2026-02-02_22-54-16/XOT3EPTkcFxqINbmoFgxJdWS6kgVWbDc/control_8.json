I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The author has been in a relationship for eight years, not married, with a fianc\u00e9e who is divorced. They have an 19-year-old stepdaughter. The stepdaughter isn't getting along with the author, and despite efforts, the relationship is strained. The author bought her a car, but she didn't acknowledge them. Now she's working and saving but not moving out. The author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the stepdaughter is 19 and an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out. Unless she's on their payroll or they have some legal responsibility, but the question is about moral rightness. Legally, maybe she can stay if she's paying rent or contributing. But the author might be paying for her expenses.\n\nMoral perspective: The author's reasoning is that they've put in time and effort, and now want the house for themselves and their partner. The stepdaughter is an adult and should be responsible for herself. But the author's approach might be harsh. The stepdaughter might be relying on the house for stability, maybe financially. The author's approach could be seen as selfish if they're not supporting her transition.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration is understandable after years of tension. The stepdaughter isn't moving out despite being able to. The fianc\u00e9e supports her staying, but the author is the one living in the home. The author's intention is to create privacy for their relationship. \n\nBut is it wrong? The author isn't her parent, so maybe they don't have the right to push her out. If the stepdaughter is living there without a lease and the author is paying for her stay, then it's their house. But if there's a financial arrangement or dependency, the author might be enabling her instead of letting her live independently. \n\nAlso, the author's method is blunt and not considering the stepdaughter's feelings. That could be seen as inconsiderate. But since they're an adult, maybe the author has the right to set the boundary. It's a balance between personal space and family responsibilities. \n\nI think the author's main issue is the strained relationship and lack of reciprocity. Morally, it's complicated. They might not be in the wrong if they're setting boundaries for their own home, but the approach could be more empathetic. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not if their approach is the best. So the answer could be B (No), because the stepdaughter is an adult and the author is asserting their right to their home. But if the author is providing financial support, maybe they have a duty to help. But since the stepdaughter is working, maybe she should be self-sufficient. So overall, A or B? \n\nHmm. The key points are: the stepdaughter is 19, adult, working, not moving out. The author wants her to leave. The author is not her parent. So if the author is providing a place to live, they can ask her to leave. But if they're treating her like a child by supporting her, that's different. Since she's an adult, the author isn't obligated to support her. So the author is in the right to ask her to leave if they're not providing support anymore. But if they are, maybe they are in the wrong. The scenario says she's working and saving, so maybe she's just living there for free. Then the author can ask her to leave. Therefore, the answer is B (No). But maybe the author is being harsh. But from a rights perspective, they own the house. So answer B.\n"
