I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their stepdaughter. The situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship but not married to their partner. The stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author feels she should move out now that she's working. The author tried to be kind but the stepdaughter was indifferent, even ignoring the gift of a car. The author wants to push her to leave, and the partner (fianc\u00e9) isn't upset but might be.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, once someone is 18, they're an adult. The author isn't the stepdaughter's legal guardian anymore. So the stepdaughter isn't obligated to move out. The author can't just kick her out without legal justification. Legally, the stepdaughter could be considered a tenant, so the author would need to follow eviction procedures, which might be complicated if they're not the legal owner of the house. Wait, the author is in a relationship with the mother, so if they own the house together, the mother might have a say. But even then, once someone is an adult, they can't be forced out without proper process. So maybe the author is not in the legal right to evict her without her mother's consent.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author has supported the stepdaughter for years, maybe financially. Now expecting her to move out could be seen as reasonable, but the way the author is approaching it\u2014blunt and not caring about her reaction\u2014might be considered harsh. However, the stepdaughter chose to stay after 18, so she's not a minor anymore. The author isn't the parent, so maybe they don't have the right to dictate her living arrangements. But the author is part of her living situation, so there's a conflict of interest here.\n\nThe author's partner (fianc\u00e9) is okay with her staying, which complicates things. The author wants the house to be just for them and the partner. But the stepdaughter's presence isn't illegal. So even if the author wants her out, they can't just do it unilaterally. They need to work with the partner/mother to reach an agreement.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, the author isn't in the right because they can't evict an adult without proper process. Ethically, they have a valid desire for privacy and space, but their approach might be considered harsh. However, the main issue is legal standing. The author isn't the legal guardian anymore, so they can't just kick her out. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they can't proceed without legal justification and the stepdaughter's cooperation. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
