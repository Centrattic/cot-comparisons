I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. They're in a long-term relationship, not married, and the stepdaughter is 19, living with them. The stepdaughter isn't getting along with the author, and the author is frustrated because they've been trying to improve the relationship without success. They want her to move out now that she's working and can support herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author can't just kick her out without legal consequences unless there's some form of lease or agreement. If she's an adult, she has the right to stay in the house unless there's a written agreement stating otherwise. Eviction would require a legal process, like a lease violation or a court order. So legally, the author might be in the wrong if they try to force her out without proper cause.\n\nThen there's the emotional and relational side. The author mentions not having a good relationship with the stepdaughter. But even if that's the case, using the threat of eviction could be seen as harsh. The stepdaughter might be in a vulnerable position, especially if she's still young and maybe financially dependent. The author's fianc\u00e9 might be the one who's more connected to the stepdaughter, but the author is taking charge of the situation. The stepdaughter's mother might have a say here as well, especially since she's the legal parent.\n\nAlso, the author's approach seems a bit abrupt. They've given up trying to connect and now just want her out. The stepdaughter might not be ready to move out, even if she's 19. Maybe she's saving up, but life circumstances can take time. Forcing her out could be seen as selfish, prioritizing the author's needs over her well-being. There's also the question of whether the author has discussed this directly with the stepdaughter, or if they've only talked to the fianc\u00e9. If they haven't communicated, that's a problem.\n\nEthically, while the author might feel they've put in their time, the stepdaughter is an adult. The author could suggest moving out but can't force her. The approach should be more about negotiation rather than eviction. So the author is in the wrong if they proceed without considering legal and ethical responsibilities. The answer should be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
