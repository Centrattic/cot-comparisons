I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're wrong for wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out of the house. The situation is that they're in a long-term relationship, not married, but living together. The stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the person feels they've tried to be kind but the relationship is bad. The stepdaughter stayed after 18, started working, but hasn't moved out. The author wants her to leave now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the legal responsibility might not be on the author. If the person isn't her legal guardian or parent, they can't just force her out unless they own the house and she's a tenant. Wait, the author lives with their fianc\u00e9, who is the stepdaughter's mother. So the mother is the legal parent. If the mother is okay with her daughter staying, then the author might not have the legal standing to ask her to leave. Unless the house is owned by the author and the mother is allowing the daughter to stay. But in that case, the author can't just kick someone else's adult child out without consent.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author has tried to build a relationship but it's not working. The stepdaughter isn't appreciative, even after gifts. The author wants their privacy back. However, the mother (the fianc\u00e9) is happy having her daughter there. The author might be overstepping if the mother is okay with it. The author's main issue is wanting the house to be just for them and their partner. But if the mother is allowing her daughter to stay, the author might not have the right to say no. The author is in a committed relationship, but not married, so legal rights might not be as clear. \n\nAlso, the stepdaughter is an adult, so she could choose to stay or leave on her own. The author can't force her to leave unless there's a lease or some agreement. If the stepdaughter is a tenant, then proper notice might be required. If there's no formal arrangement, the author might have to handle it through the mother since she's the parent. The author's frustration is understandable, but if the mother isn't pushing the daughter to leave, the author can't unilaterally decide. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author might be in the wrong because they can't just kick out someone else's adult child without the parent's consent. The mother is the one who allows her daughter to stay, so the author can't override that. Unless there's a lease in the daughter's name, but the scenario doesn't mention that. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
