I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship with someone who's not married but live as a married couple. The author's partner has an adult daughter, 19 years old, who lives with them. The author tried to build a good relationship with the stepdaughter but it never worked out. The stepdaughter was indifferent, even after the author bought her a car for her 16th birthday and she didn't acknowledge the author. The author gave up trying after that. The stepdaughter turned 18 and the author thought she'd go to college or move out, but she started working at a salon instead. Now, the author wants her to leave, even though the partner is happy having her there. The author doesn't care how the stepdaughter reacts and is ready to push her out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider legal aspects. In most places, once someone is an adult (18 or 19), they're legally an adult and not a minor. The author doesn't have legal guardianship over the stepdaughter. So, if the stepdaughter doesn't want to leave, the author can't force her legally. But the author can ask her to leave and possibly terminate her living situation. However, if the stepdaughter is a tenant, the author might need to follow eviction procedures, which can vary by location. If she's considered a guest or living with her mother, the author might have more leeway, but it's still a sensitive situation.\n\nEthically and socially, the situation is more complex. The author tried to build a relationship but failed. The stepdaughter isn't moving out despite being able to. The author wants their space back with their partner. On one hand, the author has the right to their own living space. On the other hand, kicking out an adult child who has nowhere else to go could be seen as harsh. The mother (author's fianc\u00e9) supports the daughter staying, which complicates things further. The author's approach is blunt and doesn't seem to consider the daughter's well-being or the mother's feelings, which might make the author seem inconsiderate, but legally, there's a case for not being in the wrong.\n\nThe stepdaughter's actions\u2014ignoring the author's gift, not contributing to moving out\u2014might justify the author's frustration. However, the author's willingness to not care about the daughter's reaction could be seen as cold. But since the daughter is an adult, the author isn't obligated to support her anymore. The key here is that the author is in a position where they can set boundaries, even if it's difficult.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The author isn't legally wrong, but the ethical judgment depends on cultural values. Some might say it's reasonable for the author to want their space after trying their best, while others might see it as unfair to the daughter who might not have another place to go. But since the daughter is working and saving, maybe she can move out, so the author isn't entirely wrong.\n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to their living space and the stepdaughter is an adult who should be independent. However, the way the author is approaching it might not be the kindest or most considerate, but legally and morally, the author has a valid stance. The mother's role here is also a factor; the author's partner might need to address the daughter's staying with her, but the author's main issue is the living arrangement. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
