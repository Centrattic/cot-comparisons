I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a man in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, not married. They live together with her adult daughter, who's 19. He's considering kicking her out because their relationship is poor. He tried to connect but she was indifferent, even after he bought her a car. He's frustrated because she's staying despite being able to move out. His fianc\u00e9e likes her living there, but he wants the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: The stepdaughter is 19, an adult. Legally, if she's an adult and not a minor, the author can't force her to leave unless there's a lease issue. If she's on the lease, he can't kick her out without legal process. If she's not on the lease, maybe he can, but it depends on local laws. The author might be in a situation where he's the landlord, or his fianc\u00e9e is. If she's a tenant, he might need to follow proper eviction procedures.\n\nEthically, though, it's more complex. The author's main point is that he's been supporting her. If he's been contributing to her living expenses, maybe there's an unspoken agreement. But once someone is an adult, it's their choice to leave. The author might feel entitled to have her go, but she might see it as being kicked out. The fianc\u00e9e's role is also important here; she might have a say in the household dynamics.\n\nThe author says he doesn't care how she reacts, and his fianc\u00e9e might be upset. But treating someone like this could cause conflict, especially if she's not being disrespectful. Even if the relationship is strained, being abrupt and not caring about her feelings might be harsh. However, if they're not family by blood and there's no legal obligation, maybe he's not wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The fianc\u00e9e's responsibility. If she's the one who wants her daughter to stay, maybe the author shouldn't act without her. They might need to discuss it together. The author might be overstepping if he's making that decision alone. Also, the daughter is an adult, so she should have the autonomy to decide to stay or leave. Forcing her out might be seen as controlling, but if she's staying by choice, maybe she's not being forced to leave against her will.\n\nIn summary, legally, if it's allowed, maybe not in the wrong. Ethically, it's a grey area. But considering the daughter is an adult and the author isn't her parent, he has a right to his living space. However, the approach of not caring about her reaction could be problematic. The answer might depend on the legal context, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but there are nuances.\n"
