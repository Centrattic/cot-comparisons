I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. \n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is 19 and lives with her mother's partner. The author isn't her legal parent; her mother is her legal parent. The author mentions that they've tried to have a good relationship but it's been strained. The stepdaughter isn't moving out, even though she's working and could afford to.\n\nThe key points here are legal responsibility and personal boundaries. Since the author isn't the stepdaughter's legal guardian, they don't have the authority to force her to leave. That responsibility lies with her mother. The author might feel frustrated, but they can't unilaterally decide to remove an adult from their home if they're not the parent. \n\nAlso, the stepdaughter is an adult, so she has the right to choose where she lives. The author could ask her to leave politely and set boundaries, but kicking her out without her mother's agreement could be problematic. If the mother is okay with her staying, the author's actions might not be justified from a legal standpoint. \n\nEmotionally, the author's frustration is understandable, but acting on it without considering the legal implications and the mother's wishes might not be the right approach. The mother might feel that the author is overstepping by making decisions about her child's living situation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they aren't the legal parent and can't force the stepdaughter to leave without the mother's consent. The solution should involve communication with the mother first, not unilateral action.\n"
