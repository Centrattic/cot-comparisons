I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with the author and their fianc\u00e9, and they've been trying to improve the relationship without success. The author has tried to support her, even giving her a car, but she's stayed past 18 and continues to live there. The author feels it's time for her to move out since she's working and can afford it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority over her. The author can't force her to leave unless there's a lease or some legal agreement that requires her to move. If she's on a lease, they might need to handle it through the lease terms. If she's just a tenant, then the author would need to follow proper eviction procedures, which might take time and legal steps.\n\nThen there's the relational aspect. The author and the stepdaughter have a strained relationship. The author has tried their best, but the stepdaughter hasn't reciprocated. The fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, but the author wants the house for just the two of them. Is the author justified in their feelings? Well, they have a right to their own space, but they also need to respect their partner's feelings. However, the author isn't the parent, so they don't have the same obligations as a biological parent might. \n\nEthically, is it right to ask someone to leave if they're an adult? If the stepdaughter is capable of living independently and the author is providing a place that's not necessary for her anymore, then the author's request might be reasonable. But the author needs to communicate this respectfully and possibly give her time to move out. The fact that the stepdaughter might be staying because the fianc\u00e9 wants her there complicates things, but the author's feelings about their own home are valid.\n\nHowever, the author's approach seems a bit harsh. They mention not caring how she takes it. That might be a bit dismissive. A more compassionate approach could help maintain better relations, even if the decision is made. The author might be in the right in wanting their own space but could handle the situation more tactfully.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're asserting their right to their home. However, the method and attitude in which they do it could be improved. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
