I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their adult stepdaughter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who has a 19-year-old daughter. They've been living together for 8 years, and the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to get married. The author has tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but hasn't succeeded. The stepdaughter is now 19, working, and living at home, which the author is frustrated about. They want her to move out, and the fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, but the author is ready for the house to be just the two of them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. The stepdaughter is an adult, 19 years old. Legally, adults can make their own decisions and live wherever they choose. The author is the fianc\u00e9, not a legal guardian. So, if the stepdaughter is an adult, the author might not have the legal authority to force her to leave. However, they all live together, and the author is contributing to the household, perhaps financially.\n\nThe author mentions they've tried to build a relationship but failed. The stepdaughter is indifferent, even to the extent of not acknowledging a gift. The author has given up trying and is now considering kicking her out. But is that acceptable? Legally, if the stepdaughter is an adult and the home is owned by the author and the fianc\u00e9, they might be able to ask her to leave, but that could depend on local laws\u2014like whether she's considered a tenant or if there's a lease involved. If there's no legal obligation for her to stay, the author might have the right to ask her to leave. However, the ethical aspect is more complicated.\n\nEthically, even if the author is justified in wanting their own space, how they handle the situation matters. The author is not concerned about her reaction, which might be seen as dismissive. Also, the fianc\u00e9 (the mother) might be upset, but the author is okay with that. The author's frustration is understandable given the long-term situation and lack of progress in the relationship. However, the stepdaughter is an adult who has chosen to stay. If she's working and saving money, maybe she's making her own choices, and the author should respect that. \n\nBut the author is the one providing the living space. If the stepdaughter is not contributing financially or if there's a financial arrangement, that could affect the situation. If the author is covering her living costs, they might feel they can set boundaries. However, the stepdaughter might have the right to stay if it's not a legal tenancy. Also, the author's approach of being blunt and not caring about her reaction might be seen as harsh, even if justified.\n\nIn some places, adult children can live with their parents indefinitely, but when someone else is involved (like a partner), it can become a conflict. The author's position is that they've given their time and now want their space. The stepdaughter has the choice to move out once she's ready. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's a gray area. However, if the author is the one providing the home, they might have the right to ask her to leave, especially if she's not contributing or if there's a mutual understanding that she would leave after high school. \n\nBut the author did assume she would leave at 18, but she didn't. The fianc\u00e9 supports her staying, so there's a conflict between the author and the fianc\u00e9. The author's desire for their own space is valid, but the method of handling it could be problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not the legal guardian and the stepdaughter is an adult, the author might have the right to ask her to leave. But if the stepdaughter is staying with her mother's consent, the author's ability to do so without the mother's support might be limited. \n\nIn summary, legally, the author might have the right, but ethically, it's a complex situation. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given that the stepdaughter is an adult and the author is not her parent, the author might not be in the wrong if they have the legal right to set household rules. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
