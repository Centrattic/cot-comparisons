I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their adult stepdaughter out of the house. The stepdaughter is 19, living with them, and the author's fianc\u00e9 (who isn't married) has been supporting her financially. The author tried to build a relationship but felt ignored, especially after buying a car for her birthday. Now, they feel it's time for her to move out since she's an adult and can support herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, once someone is an adult, they can't be \"kicked out\" without following proper legal procedures. The author's fianc\u00e9 is the legal parent, so they can't just evict an adult child without going through the law. But the question is about moral wrong, not legal. However, sometimes the answer might depend on whether the stepdaughter is considered a legal adult and if she's paying rent or not. If she's not contributing and the author is helping financially, they might have a right to ask her to leave.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. The author tried to be kind and build a relationship but was met with indifference. The stepdaughter didn't acknowledge the car gift, which was a big gesture. The author might feel entitled to their space now that the stepdaughter is 19. But the fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, which complicates things. The author is proposing to push her out, which could be harsh, but maybe justified if the stepdaughter isn't planning to leave otherwise.\n\nThe stepdaughter's perspective is important too. At 19, she might still be in a transitional phase, saving money for her future. The author's decision could disrupt her plans. However, the author might feel they've done their part and now need to focus on their own relationship. There's also the question of family dynamics and how the stepdaughter's mother (the fianc\u00e9) feels about this. Since the author is in a long-term relationship but not married, their authority might be less clear.\n\nI need to check if there are any assumptions here. The author says they \"told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.\" That part might not be directly relevant but shows the relationship context. The key issues are the author's responsibility towards the stepdaughter and the right to privacy in their home.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have the right to set boundaries, especially if the stepdaughter isn't respecting their presence or contributing. However, the stepdaughter is still a minor in some places (depending on the country; in the US, 18 is adult but sometimes 19 is considered young adult). If she's not contributing, the author could argue it's time for her to leave. But the author's approach is to \"push her out of the nest\" without considering her feelings much. That could be seen as harsh, but maybe justified if the author has had enough.\n\nAnother angle: the author is not the biological parent, so their obligations might be different. They provided support before, but now that the stepdaughter is 19 and can support herself, the author might feel it's reasonable to ask her to leave. The fianc\u00e9's support for her daughter's staying could create a conflict in the relationship, but the author might have the right to ask for their own space.\n\nI should also consider if the author is being fair. The stepdaughter might not have a place to go, so kicking her out without a plan could leave her in a difficult situation. The author's indifference to her reaction might be seen as not considering her well-being. However, the author could argue that they've given enough time and effort and need to prioritize their own relationship.\n\nIn the US, if an adult is living in a home and not paying rent, the owner can ask them to leave. But the author isn't the legal guardian, so they might need to work with their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9's stance is important here. If the author is trying to push their fianc\u00e9 to make the decision, it's a family matter where both parties need to agree. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of handling it might affect their relationship with the fianc\u00e9, especially if the stepdaughter is still dependent.\n\nPossible conclusion: the author isn't in the wrong if they're approaching this as a reasonable request for the stepdaughter to move out, but doing it abruptly and without considering the daughter's needs could be problematic. The answer would depend on the approach and whether they're providing support or just setting boundaries. Since the author is not the parent and the stepdaughter is 19 (so an adult), the author's desire for personal space is valid. However, the lack of consideration for the daughter's feelings might be seen as harsh, but not necessarily wrong if the author has made their efforts clear.\n"
