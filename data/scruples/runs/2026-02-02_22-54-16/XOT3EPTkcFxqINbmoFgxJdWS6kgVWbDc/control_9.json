I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author has had a strained relationship with her. The stepdaughter wasn't interested in improving the relationship, even after the author tried various things like buying a car. Now that she's working and has money, the author wants her to move out because they want their house back for themselves and their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once someone turns 18, they're considered an adult, and the legal guardian (in this case, the stepmother) isn't obligated to support them financially anymore. However, if the stepdaughter is still living at home, the author might not have a legal obligation to provide her housing unless there's some sort of agreement or lease. But the author isn't the legal parent, so they don't have the authority to force her out without the stepmother's consent.\n\nLooking at the relationship dynamics, the author has tried to build a relationship but was met with indifference. The stepdaughter's mother is okay with her staying, which complicates things. The author's main issue is wanting their privacy and space back. But since the stepdaughter isn't their legal child, the author's decision to ask her to leave could be seen as overstepping if the mother is okay with her staying.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author isn't the parent, so they might not have the right to make that decision. The stepdaughter has the right to live where she chooses unless there's a lease agreement. However, the author is paying for the house, so they might feel entitled to ask her to leave. But since the mother is the legal parent and supports her staying, the author's action could be seen as disrespectful or violating an unspoken understanding.\n\nThe author's approach of not caring about her reaction and pushing her out might come off as harsh. They should consider communication, maybe setting boundaries, or discussing the situation with the stepmother to find a mutual agreement. Forcing the issue without considering the stepmother's wishes could strain the relationship with both the stepdaughter and the spouse.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid feelings about wanting their space back, their approach might be inconsiderate of the stepmother's role and the stepdaughter's autonomy. They might not be legally in the wrong, but ethically, they could be seen as overstepping if they proceed without considering the other parties' perspectives.\n"
