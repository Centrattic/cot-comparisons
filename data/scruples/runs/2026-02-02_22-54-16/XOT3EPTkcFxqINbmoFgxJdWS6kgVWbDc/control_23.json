I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author considering kicking out his adult stepdaughter from their home. \n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, not married. They live together, and his stepdaughter is 19, an adult. The stepdaughter has been living with them since she was 16, but the author feels she should move out now that she's working and has the means. The stepdaughter isn't really close to the author, and even after he bought her a car, she didn't acknowledge him, which made him give up trying to build a relationship. The author's main issue is that he wants the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9e, and he's frustrated that the stepdaughter isn't moving out on her own.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, the stepdaughter is an adult, so she's responsible for her own living arrangements. The author isn't her parent; her mother is the one in the relationship. So legally, the stepdaughter could be expected to move out if she's an adult. But ethically, it's more complicated. The author has been financially supporting her, and now he wants her to leave because he wants their house back. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he tried to build a relationship, but she was indifferent. He feels he's done his part and wants her to become independent. However, there's a consideration of how the stepdaughter feels. She might not have a place to go, or she might rely on this arrangement. Also, the author's fianc\u00e9e is okay with the stepdaughter staying, which might mean there's some emotional attachment or dependency there. \n\nThe author's main argument is about his own needs and the desire for privacy. But as a stepparent, even if not a biological parent, there's a social responsibility to some extent. However, since the stepdaughter is an adult and the author isn't her legal guardian, he doesn't have the authority to force her out. The mother, being her parent, has more responsibility in that regard. The author might be right in expecting the stepdaughter to move out, but the way he's approaching it\u2014being blunt and not caring how she reacts\u2014might be harsh. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is personal: wanting the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9e. That's valid, but it's important to consider whether the stepdaughter has other options. If she's planning to save money and hasn't found a place, kicking her out without support could be problematic. The author might be in the right in terms of not being obligated to keep her, but the manner in which he's doing it could be seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, balancing legal rights versus ethical responsibilities, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's a gray area. The answer depends on whether the question is about legal wrong or moral wrong. The question seems to be asking about moral wrong. In that case, the author's desire to prioritize his own needs over the stepdaughter's situation could be seen as wrong, especially if she's not ready to leave and there's no alternative provided. However, since she's an adult, he's not necessarily in the wrong for expecting her to move out on her own terms. But pushing her out abruptly without considering her circumstances might be where he's wrong.\n"
