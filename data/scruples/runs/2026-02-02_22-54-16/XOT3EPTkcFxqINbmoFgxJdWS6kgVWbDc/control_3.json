I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter who's 19 and living with them. The author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who isn't married but live together. The stepdaughter was bought a car at 16, but she didn't acknowledge the author. Now that she's 19 and working, she's staying, and the author wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, the stepdaughter is an adult, so legally, she's an adult. The author might not have a legal obligation to support her anymore. But how they treat her is another matter. The author says they've tried to be kind but stopped trying after being ignored. However, the stepdaughter is living in their house, and they're living as a married couple but aren't married. The fianc\u00e9 wants her to stay, but the author doesn't. \n\nNow, the author's reasoning is that they've put in their time supporting her and now it's time for her to move out. But the stepdaughter hasn't moved out yet. The author wants to be pushy about it. The key here is whether the author has the right to force her out. Legally, if the stepdaughter is an adult and the author isn't her legal guardian, they might not have the legal authority to make her leave. However, if she's a renter or a guest, the author might have more say. But if she's a tenant, the author might need to follow legal eviction processes.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The author has tried to build a relationship but feels it's one-way. They might feel entitled to their space, but the stepdaughter might be relying on them financially. If the author is providing a home without legal obligation, they can choose to stop, but doing so abruptly could be seen as harsh. Also, the mother (the author's fianc\u00e9) is supportive of her living there, which complicates things because the author is in a relationship with her. \n\nThe author's approach of not caring how the stepdaughter reacts and pushing her out might be seen as dismissive. The stepdaughter might not have a place to go, so this could be a matter of responsibility. The author might be in the right legally if they can evict her properly, but ethically, there's a question about their duty of care or support, especially if the stepdaughter is still dependent. However, since she's an adult and working, maybe she should be expected to move out. But the author's method of doing it without considering her situation might be wrong. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether they have legal standing to remove her, but ethically, if they've been supporting her, they might be in the wrong to just kick her out without considering her needs. But if they're providing a home as a favor and not legally responsible, then they might not be in the wrong. However, given the information, the author's approach seems abrupt and possibly inconsiderate, so they might be in the wrong.\n"
