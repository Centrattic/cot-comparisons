I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about an adult stepdaughter living with them, and the author wants to kick her out. \n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship but not married. They have a 19-year-old stepdaughter who lives with them. The author tried to build a relationship but felt ignored, like when buying her a car and she didn't acknowledge them. Now, the stepdaughter is working and saving money but doesn't want to leave. The author is frustrated and wants her to move out.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, if the stepdaughter is an adult and not a minor, she's an adult and technically can decide where to live. The author isn't her parent, so they might not have legal authority to force her out. However, if she's still living under their roof because of her mother's arrangement, maybe there's a financial or housing situation. \n\nEthically, the author feels they've done their part. They tried to be kind, supported her with the car, but the stepdaughter didn't reciprocate. The author wants their own space with their partner. But how to handle it respectfully? The author is considering kicking her out without her consent. That could be harsh because the stepdaughter might not have other options. \n\nThe author's partner is okay with her staying, which complicates things. The author wants to push for her to move out, but maybe they should communicate with the stepdaughter first. Maybe set a timeline or discuss reasons. If the author just kicks her out without discussion, that could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author mentions not caring how she reacts. That's a red flag. It's important to be considerate even if there's a bad relationship. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might be if they're not giving the stepdaughter a chance to find her own place or if they're not considering her needs. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're planning to evict an adult without considering her circumstances and without proper communication. Alternatively, if they're providing a way for her to leave, maybe not. But the way the author is approaching it seems abrupt and disrespectful. So leaning towards A.\n"
