I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is justified in wanting to kick out their stepdaughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a long-term relationship with someone who's not his wife, though they live together. They have an 18-year-old stepdaughter who's now 19 and living with them. The author mentions that he and the stepdaughter have a poor relationship. He tried to buy her a car, but she didn't acknowledge him, which made him give up. Now, he wants her to leave because he wants the house to himself and his fianc\u00e9. The stepdaughter isn't planning to move out, even though she's working and can afford it. The author is considering pushing her out, regardless of her feelings.\n\nSo, the main points are: the stepdaughter is an adult, she's financially independent, she's choosing to stay, the author wants her out for his own comfort, and there's no legal obligation to support her anymore since she's an adult. \n\nIn many places, once someone turns 18, parents (or stepparents) aren't legally responsible for their care. The author isn't her biological parent, so he doesn't have the same legal obligations. However, if he's providing financial support, there might be some expectations. But in this case, the stepdaughter is working and saving, so maybe he's not giving her money anymore. The problem is whether it's morally right to ask her to leave if she's choosing to stay.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's tried to be kind, but the stepdaughter's indifference has led him to give up. He wants his privacy and a better relationship with his partner. On the flip side, the stepdaughter might feel entitled to stay because she's part of the household, and the author's decision could be seen as harsh, especially if there's no clear discussion or mutual agreement.\n\nBut since she's an adult, he can't force her to leave without some legal basis. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not providing financial support and she's choosing to stay, maybe it's his right to ask her to leave. But if he's been supporting her, maybe he's expected to let her stay. The key here is that the author is not her legal parent and might not have a duty to support her anymore. Therefore, his decision to ask her to leave could be justified. However, the way he's approaching it, being dismissive of her feelings, might be problematic.\n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. Legally, probably not. Morally, it's a gray area. But since the options are A (Yes) or B (No), and the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B, because as an adult, she can be asked to leave. But if the author is providing a place to stay and she's financially independent, it's a matter of household dynamics. However, the author is not her legal guardian, so he's not obligated to let her stay. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
