I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and the author's fianc\u00e9 (his partner, since they're not married) is okay with her staying. The author feels like he's done enough by buying her a car and supporting her, but she's choosing to stay. He's fed up and wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since she's an adult, she's probably not a minor, so the author doesn't have legal authority over her. Even if they live together, once someone is an adult, they can't just be kicked out without following proper legal procedures. Unless there's some shared living agreement or lease terms that specify this, the author might not have the legal right to ask her to leave. That could be a point where the author is in the wrong if they proceed without legal justification.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions they tried to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. He gave up after the car incident. Now he's pushing for her to leave. The fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, which might create tension. The author's motivation is to have the house to himself and his partner. But is it fair to force someone out of their home just because he wants privacy? The stepdaughter is working and saving, which implies financial independence. If she's paying rent, maybe there's another dynamic. If she's not paying rent, the author might be subsidizing her stay, which could be a valid reason to ask her to leave. However, the author's approach seems abrupt and not considering her feelings or circumstances.\n\nAlso, the author's fianc\u00e9 might have a different perspective. The stepdaughter might be part of the family in some way, and the author's decision could affect the relationship with his partner. The author's indifference to her reaction might be seen as harsh. Even if legally possible, ethically, is it right to eject someone from a home where they've lived for years?\n\nIn terms of societal norms, supporting adult children until they're ready is common, but it's also about mutual agreement. If there's no agreement on living arrangements, the author has a point in wanting her to leave if she's not contributing or planning to move out. However, the method of \"pushing her out\" without considering her input could be problematic. The author might need to communicate better, set boundaries, or find a compromise rather than just deciding unilaterally.\n\nPutting it all together, legally the author might not be in the wrong if the stepdaughter is not under his guardianship. Ethically, there are gray areas. The author's approach might be seen as harsh, but his desire for privacy isn't unreasonable. However, the way he's handling it\u2014without considering legal or emotional consequences\u2014could be where he's wrong. So the answer might be A (yes) because of the abruptness and lack of consideration for her situation and the partner's feelings, but maybe B (no) because he's not legally required to support her. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is A because pushing her out without legal grounds and being indifferent to her feelings is ethically questionable, even if it's not illegal.\n"
