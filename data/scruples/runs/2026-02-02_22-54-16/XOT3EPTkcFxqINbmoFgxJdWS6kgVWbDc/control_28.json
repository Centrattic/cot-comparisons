I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) post is in the wrong. The author is considering kicking out their 19-year-old stepdaughter who lives with them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a long-term relationship with their fianc\u00e9, not married. The stepdaughter is 19, works at a salon, and has been living with them since she was 18. The author tried to build a relationship but felt ignored, especially when they bought her a car. Now they want her to move out, and they don't care how she reacts. The fianc\u00e9 might be upset but the author thinks it's for the best.\n\nSo, the key points here: The stepdaughter is an adult, over 18, and financially independent (has a job). The author is not her parent, just a stepparent. The question is whether they have the right to ask her to leave. Legally, if the stepdaughter is an adult and not under the care of the author, they can't just kick her out without cause, especially if she's paying rent or contributing. But the situation here is that the author is providing her a place to stay, perhaps as part of the living arrangement with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nBut the author is not her legal guardian. The fianc\u00e9 (who is her biological mother) is the one who allows her to stay. So if the author is living in a shared household where the stepdaughter is staying with her mother's consent, the author might not have the authority to unilaterally decide she has to leave. The author is in a de facto marriage, but not legally married. The mother's approval is key here. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable\u2014they want their own space. However, the stepdaughter is an adult and may have the right to stay if the mother allows it. The author's approach of not caring how she takes it might be seen as harsh, especially if the stepdaughter hasn't been given a choice or a timeline. Also, the car gift and the stepdaughter's indifference add to the tension. \n\nLegally, unless there's a lease agreement or something that specifies the stepdaughter's tenancy, the author might not have the legal standing to tell her to leave. Emotionally, the author is justified in feeling this way, but acting on it without considering the mother's role and the stepdaughter's autonomy could be problematic. \n\nSo, the author is in a position where they are not the legal parent, and their authority is limited. They might be overstepping if they try to remove the stepdaughter without the mother's agreement. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they don't have the legal or ethical authority to kick out an adult who is staying with her mother's permission.\n"
