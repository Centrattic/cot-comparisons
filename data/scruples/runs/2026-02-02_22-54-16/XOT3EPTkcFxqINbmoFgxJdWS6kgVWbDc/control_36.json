I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9, and they live together. They're not married, but they're together. The stepdaughter is 19, an adult, and has been living with them. The author mentions that he tried to build a relationship with her but didn't succeed, even after giving her a car for her 16th birthday, which she didn't acknowledge. Now, she's working and saving money but hasn't moved out. The author wants her to leave because he wants the house to be just for him and his fianc\u00e9.\n\nSo the key points here are: the stepdaughter is an adult, the author isn't her parent, and he's considering forcing her out. Legally, if the person isn't the parent, they can't force someone else's adult child to leave unless they're on the lease. If the author is on the lease or owns the house, he might have the right to ask someone to leave if they're not his legal responsibility. But there's also the emotional aspect\u2014how does the fianc\u00e9 feel about this? The author's fianc\u00e9 might be the one who actually wants her daughter to stay, so there's a conflict there. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's given his time and support, and now it's time for the stepdaughter to be independent. But since she's an adult, isn't it her choice whether to stay or go? The author's approach is pretty blunt, and he mentions not caring how she reacts, which could be seen as harsh. However, if he's not her parent, maybe he's justified in setting boundaries. \n\nBut there's also the consideration of how the stepdaughter is being treated. If she's contributing financially and the author is just being impatient, that could be a problem. Also, the fianc\u00e9 might feel caught between her partner and her child, which complicates things. The author's main issue is wanting the house to himself and his partner, which is a valid desire, but he needs to consider the rights and feelings of others involved. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the stepdaughter is an adult and the author isn't her guardian, then legally he might have the right to ask her to leave if it's his house. But ethically, it's more complicated. He should communicate with her, maybe give her a timeline to move out, and consider her situation. The fact that he's not considering her feelings and is being dismissive might make him look inconsiderate. However, if he's not the one responsible for her, maybe he's not in the wrong. But since the fianc\u00e9 is the parent, the author might need to work with her to find a solution that respects everyone's needs.\n"
