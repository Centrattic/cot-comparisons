I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong when considering kicking out his stepdaughter. So, first, I need to understand the scenario properly.\n\nThe author is in a long-term relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, not married. They've been together for 8 years. The fianc\u00e9e's daughter is 19 and lives with them. The author and stepdaughter have a poor relationship. The author tried hard to build a bond, but the stepdaughter was indifferent. The car incident at 16 where the stepdaughter didn't acknowledge him is a key point. The author has given up trying and now wants her to leave because she's 19 and working, but hasn't moved out. The fianc\u00e9e supports her living there, but the author wants the house for just the two of them. He's not too concerned about her reaction and is ready to push her out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. I need to consider legal, ethical, and social aspects.\n\nLegally, in the US, once someone is 18, they are an adult. The parents (or step-parents) don't have legal authority over them unless there's guardianship. Since the author isn't the biological parent, he has no legal obligation to support the stepdaughter. If she's over 18, he can ask her to leave, and she can't be forced to stay. So legally, the author is probably in the right. But there might be lease agreements or shared living arrangements. If the stepdaughter is on the lease, he can't just kick her out without legal steps, like eviction. But since the author is in a long-term relationship and the fianc\u00e9e is the one who might be on the lease, that's a factor. However, the user didn't mention that, so we might assume it's a common situation.\n\nEthically, the author tried to build a relationship but without success. The stepdaughter isn't contributing to the household or moving out. The author's desire for his own space is understandable. However, the approach of just kicking her out might be harsh. The author isn't providing support anymore, which is fair since she's an adult. But the communication aspect matters. The author should have a conversation with the stepdaughter, not just assume. Also, the stepdaughter might not have enough savings to move out, so the author's assumption that she can move out could be incorrect. If she's working and saving, maybe she's not ready yet, but the author might be impatient.\n\nSocially, families often have complex dynamics. The author's relationship with the stepdaughter is strained, and the fianc\u00e9e supports her. The author's decision might affect the relationship with the fianc\u00e9e. However, if the author is in a committed relationship, his partner's feelings are also a factor. The author is aware that the fianc\u00e9e might be upset but thinks she'll come around. That's a risk.\n\nSo, putting it all together. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong. He's an adult, the stepdaughter is 19, and he can ask her to leave. Ethically, it's a bit tricky. He tried to build a relationship but gave up. Now, he's enforcing boundaries. If the stepdaughter is an adult and not contributing, it's reasonable. However, the method of just \"pushing her out\" without considering her situation might be abrupt. But since the author is not her parent, he's not obligated to support her anymore. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the author should have a conversation and offer support rather than just kicking her out. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether his approach is optimal. Legally and ethically, unless there's a legal obligation, the author is in the right.\n"
