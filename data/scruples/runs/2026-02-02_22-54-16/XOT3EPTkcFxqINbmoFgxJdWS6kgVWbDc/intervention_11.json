I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The situation is that the author is in an 8-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who was previously divorced and not interested in marriage. They have a stepdaughter who lives with them.\n\nThe author tried to build a relationship with the stepdaughter but she was indifferent, even after a big gift like a car. They've given up trying and now want her to move out since she's an adult and financially capable. The fianc\u00e9 wants her to stay, but the author is concerned about their own relationship and living situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 19, the stepdaughter is an adult, so legally, the author probably doesn't have to support her anymore unless there's some specific arrangement. But in the US, stepchildren don't have the same legal obligations as biological children unless the stepparent has legally adopted them. The author didn't mention adoption, so maybe they can't be forced to provide support. However, kicking someone out without cause might still be an issue if they're on a lease or if there's a shared tenancy agreement. The author should check their lease and local laws to make sure they have the right to remove her.\n\nThen there's the moral and ethical part. The author has been supporting the stepdaughter for years, even buying her a car. The stepdaughter's mother is the one who's been providing care, and the author's fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying. The stepdaughter doesn't seem to have a problem, as she's choosing to stay to save money. The author wants their own space with their partner, which is understandable. But is it fair to kick her out now, especially if she's contributing to the household or if there's a financial arrangement in place?\n\nThe author's approach is also questionable. They mention not caring how the stepdaughter reacts and pushing her out. This could be seen as harsh, especially if the stepdaughter is not causing any issues. The author might be using their position in the relationship to assert control, which could lead to conflict. The fianc\u00e9's feelings are also a factor; if the author's actions make the fianc\u00e9 upset, it might strain their relationship instead of helping it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues they've put in their time and now want the house to themselves. The stepdaughter isn't their biological child, so maybe the author doesn't have a legal or moral obligation to support her. But it's important to consider if the stepdaughter is financially dependent on them or if there's an unspoken agreement. If the stepdaughter is paying rent or contributing in some way, that's different. The author hasn't mentioned that, so maybe she's living there for free. However, the author's decision to remove her might be seen as abrupt and not considering her needs, even if she's an adult.\n\nThe key points here are legality, financial responsibility, and the potential impact on their partner. The author's main concern is their own living situation and relationship with their fianc\u00e9. But if the stepdaughter is staying by choice and the mother is okay with it, the author might not have the authority to decide without considering the mother's wishes. The fianc\u00e9's stance is crucial because if she's the one who wants the daughter to stay, maybe the author should have a conversation with her first rather than acting unilaterally.\n\nAlso, the stepdaughter's reaction isn't mentioned. If she's happy to stay, forcing her out could be harmful. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach needs to be more collaborative. Maybe setting boundaries, discussing expectations, or giving her a timeline to move out on her own. Kicking her out without prior discussion might be seen as overstepping, even if she's an adult. The author should consider communication and mutual agreement before taking such a drastic step.\n"
