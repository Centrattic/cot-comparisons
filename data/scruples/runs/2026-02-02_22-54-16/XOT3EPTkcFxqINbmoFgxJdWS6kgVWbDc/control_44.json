I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when considering kicking out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The situation is that the author is in an 8-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9, who isn't married but live together. The stepdaughter, who is 19, has been living with them since high school. The author tried to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent, even after getting a car for her 16th birthday which she didn't acknowledge. Now that she's 19 and working, the author wants her to move out because they want their home back with just their partner. The fianc\u00e9 is okay with her staying, but the author is pushing for her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is 19, which is an adult in most places, the author can't just legally kick her out unless there's some agreement or lease terms in place. If she's on the lease, they might need her consent to end it. If not, they might have to follow proper eviction procedures, which can take time and require a valid reason. Legally, the author might not be in the wrong if they follow the proper process, but if they do something abrupt or without proper notice, that could be an issue.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author has been kind, tried to build a relationship, but the stepdaughter hasn't reciprocated. The author isn't her parent, so they don't have the same authority to make her leave. However, they are allowing her to live there for free or at a reduced cost, and the author feels entitled to their space now. The fianc\u00e9's role is a bit tricky because she's the parent and might be using the home as a living arrangement for her daughter. The author might be frustrated with the situation and want to set boundaries, which is understandable, but how they handle it matters.\n\nThe stepdaughter's responsibility is also a factor. At 19, she's an adult and should be working towards independence. If she's working, she should be able to afford her own place. If she's staying because she can, it's her choice, but the author isn't obligated to let her stay. However, the author's approach of being abrupt and not caring about her reaction might be harsh. Maybe a more constructive approach would be to set a timeline for her to move out, give her support in finding a place, or have a conversation with her directly instead of involving the fianc\u00e9.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the relationship with the fianc\u00e9. The author's fianc\u00e9 might be in a bind because she's okay with her daughter staying, possibly because she doesn't want to pressure her. The author's decision could strain their relationship if the fianc\u00e9 is upset. The author needs to consider the impact on their marriage and communication about this issue.\n\nSo, the author's intentions are to reclaim their home and set boundaries, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the method of handling the situation\u2014being blunt and not caring about her reaction\u2014might be problematic. The author should ensure they follow legal procedures and communicate respectfully, even if they don't care for the stepdaughter's feelings. If they are acting within the law and giving proper notice, they might not be in the wrong. But if they're being unfair or not considering the stepdaughter's position, that could be an issue. The key factors are the legal process and respectful communication.\n"
