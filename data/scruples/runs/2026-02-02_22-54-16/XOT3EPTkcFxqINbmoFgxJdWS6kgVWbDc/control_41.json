I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether kicking out his adult stepdaughter is justified.\n\nFirst, the user is in an 8-year relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, who has a 19-year-old daughter living with them. The stepdaughter and he have always had a bad relationship, and he's given up trying. He wanted her to move out once she turned 18, but she didn't. Now he's considering kicking her out, even though he's not legally her stepfather since they aren't married. \n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if they aren't married, he's not her legal parent, so he can't unilaterally decide to kick her out. The legal guardian is her mother. So if he's not the legal guardian, he can't evict her without her mother's consent or a legal process. That's a key point. Without legal authority, it's not his decision to make.\n\nEthically, even if the relationship is strained, the stepdaughter is an adult and has the right to her own living situation. The author might be frustrated, but the mother is the one who allows her to stay. The fianc\u00e9e is happy having her daughter there, so the author's desire to have the house to himself and his partner might be selfish. Also, the stepdaughter isn't a financial burden anymore and can afford to move out. The author's approach seems abrupt and dismissive of her feelings and autonomy. \n\nAnother angle: the mother's role. If the author is pressuring the mother to make her daughter leave, maybe the mother is in a position where she wants her daughter to move out but isn't pushing her. But the author is taking matters into his own hands, which could be wrong because he's not the parent. \n\nPossible consequences: The stepdaughter might feel betrayed, especially if the mother isn't involved. The relationship between the author and his fianc\u00e9e could suffer. Also, if the daughter decides to stay, legal action could be taken, depending on the circumstances. \n\nIn summary, the author is not the legal parent, so he can't force her out. Ethically, he's overstepping by not considering her autonomy and the mother's role. His approach is harsh and might harm family dynamics. So the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
