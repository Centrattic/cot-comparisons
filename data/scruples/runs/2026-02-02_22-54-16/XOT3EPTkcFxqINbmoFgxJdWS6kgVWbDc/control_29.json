I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering kicking out their 19-year-old stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter lives with them, the author isn't her parent, and the stepdaughter has been there since she was a minor. Now that she's 19 and working, the author wants her to leave so they can have the house to themselves.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: In most places, once someone turns 18, they're legally an adult. That means the author doesn't have the legal right to force her to move out unless there's a lease or some agreement in place. If the stepdaughter is on the lease or pays rent, the author can't just kick her out without following proper legal procedures. But if she's living there without a formal agreement, the author might need to give notice or go through an eviction process, which can be complicated without a lease.\n\nEmotionally, the author and stepdaughter have a strained relationship. The author tried to build a relationship but was met with indifference. The stepdaughter hasn't moved out despite being able to financially. The author's fianc\u00e9 (not married) is okay with her staying. The author wants to push for her to leave for their own peace of mind. \n\nEthically, it's tricky. The author isn't the parent, so they might not have the same responsibility as a biological parent. However, if they've been supporting her financially or otherwise, there could be an expectation of support. But since she's an adult, she's responsible for her own decisions. The author might feel they've done their part, especially after buying a car for her. But the stepdaughter's choice to stay might be based on her own reasons, maybe lack of resources or preference.\n\nIf there's no legal agreement, the author can't just force her out. They might need to talk about expectations, maybe set a deadline for her to move out, and if she refuses, handle it through legal means if necessary. The author's approach of being blunt and not caring about her reaction could lead to conflict, especially with the fianc\u00e9 being upset. It's important to consider how this affects the entire household dynamics.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, they might be if they don't follow proper procedures. Ethically, it's a gray area. They have the right to their own space, but they also need to consider the stepdaughter's autonomy. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have the same authority as a parent. If they proceed without proper legal steps, they could be in the wrong. Also, pushing someone out without a plan might not be fair if the stepdaughter isn't ready to leave. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they might not have the legal right to kick her out and their approach could be seen as harsh without considering her autonomy and the household's agreements.\n"
