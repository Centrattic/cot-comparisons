I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out their adult stepdaughter. The situation is that the stepdaughter is 19, lives with them, and the author is in a long-term relationship with the mother, but not married. The stepdaughter works and could move out, but hasn't. The author is frustrated and wants her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the stepdaughter is an adult, the author doesn't have legal authority to force her out. Unless there's a lease or some legal agreement, an adult child can't be legally removed without their consent. So maybe the author is overstepping legally by planning to kick her out.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author mentions they tried to build a relationship but the stepdaughter was indifferent. The author is not her parent, so maybe it's not their place to decide when she should leave. The stepdaughter might be in a financial situation where staying is necessary, even if she wants to leave. The author's frustration is understandable, but using force without considering her autonomy could be wrong.\n\nAlso, the mother is okay with her staying, so the author is going behind her back to push the stepdaughter out. That might create conflict in the relationship. The author could have discussed this with their partner first. The stepdaughter's consent and wishes are important here. The author's approach seems abrupt and not considering her perspective, which might be inconsiderate.\n\nIn summary, legally the author can't force her out. Ethically, it's about respecting the adult daughter's autonomy. The author's actions might be seen as overreaching, so they could be in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
