I\u2019m in a long term relationship.  We aren\u2019t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We\u2019ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She\u2019s 19. \n\nMy \u201cstepdaughter\u201d and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I\u2019ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I\u2019m still kind when I\u2019m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I\u2019ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fianc\u00e9 loves having her here, but I\u2019ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fianc\u00e9 and I.   \n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it\u2019s time to push her out of the nest.  I\u2019m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don\u2019t really care how she takes it.   My fianc\u00e9 will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it\u2019s for the best.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're wrong for wanting to kick out their stepdaughter who's 19 and lives with them. The stepdaughter was given a car for her 16th birthday but didn't acknowledge the author, which seems to have hurt his feelings. He's been trying to be kind but has given up, and now he wants her out since she's an adult and can support herself.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: At 19, she's an adult. In most places, the legal guardian is the mother (her stepmom here). The author isn't her legal parent, so he doesn't have the authority to kick her out. That's a red flag. Legally, he can't force her to leave unless there's some sort of lease or roommate agreement, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nEmotional aspect: The stepdaughter might be staying because she's not ready to leave or because her mother allows it. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach is harsh. Bluntly kicking her out without considering her feelings or circumstances could be hurtful. Also, the author's fianc\u00e9e (the mother) might be involved in this dynamic, and he's not talking to her directly about this, which could cause conflict.\n\nEthical considerations: Even if legally possible, it's ethically questionable to evict someone who's family, especially if they're staying in a family home. The stepdaughter might be in a vulnerable position, and the author's actions could be seen as selfish, prioritizing his own needs over her well-being. The author mentions not caring how she reacts, which shows a lack of empathy.\n\nPossible solutions: Maybe setting boundaries, discussing expectations with the fianc\u00e9e, or encouraging the stepdaughter to move out through support rather than force. The author could set a timeline or conditions for her to move out once she's more independent, but outright kicking her out might be too abrupt and harsh.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a tricky situation but the method they're considering is problematic. They might not be legally in the wrong, but ethically, they're overstepping by wanting to evict an adult family member without considering the repercussions. It's a complex family situation where communication and empathy are key. The answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because the approach is ethically flawed and potentially harmful.\n"
