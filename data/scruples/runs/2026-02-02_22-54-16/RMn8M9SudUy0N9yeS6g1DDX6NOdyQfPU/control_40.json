      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for being upset because his wife didn't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a husband who is upset about not being allowed to attend the gender reveal ultrasound. The question is whether that makes him the \"asshole\" (AITA) in this scenario.\n\nI should start by considering typical gender roles and how societal norms have changed. In the past, women typically attended these appointments alone, especially for gender reveals, but nowadays, many couples attend together. However, the wife's decision not to include the husband might have a reason. Maybe she wanted it to be a surprise for herself, or perhaps there were logistical reasons like the appointment time not being convenient for him. Alternatively, maybe she felt more comfortable going alone.\n\nBut the husband is upset because he wasn't included. Is his reaction justified? It depends on the circumstances. If the wife had a valid reason, like wanting to save the surprise, maybe the husband's reaction is overblown. However, if the husband felt excluded or that his partner didn't want him involved, that could be a valid concern. Communication is key here. If the wife didn't explain her reasoning, the husband's frustration might be understandable.\n\nI should also consider the broader context of relationship dynamics. In some cases, not including a partner in a significant moment like a gender reveal could be seen as dismissive of their role in the pregnancy. On the flip side, if the wife made a decision to surprise the husband, maybe she had good intentions.\n\nAnother angle: the husband's right to be present during a medical procedure involving their child. Ultrasounds are medical appointments, and both parents might want to attend. However, the wife has the final say in her medical decisions unless there's a legal agreement otherwise. But that's more about legal rights than emotional hurt feelings.\n\nI need to recall similar AITA scenarios. Often, when one partner feels excluded from a significant event, it's considered a relationship issue that requires discussion. If the husband's upset is about feeling shut out, then the wife might need to explain her reasoning. But if she had a good reason (like wanting to keep it a surprise), then the husband's reaction might be seen as not the asshole.\n\nHowever, if the husband felt it was important to be there and the wife didn't communicate why she excluded him, that could be a point where the wife is in the wrong. But the question is about the husband being in the wrong for being upset.\n\nIn many AITA threads, being upset about being excluded isn't considered the asshole if the other person doesn't have a clear reason. If the wife didn't have a valid reason, then the husband is justified. If she did, maybe not. Since the original post doesn't provide the wife's reasoning, we have to assume it's not given. So, from the husband's perspective, his reaction is a valid expression of feeling excluded. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong.\n\nBut another thought: sometimes people take it personally if a partner doesn't want to include them in a specific event. If the wife's intention was just to surprise him later, the husband's reaction might be overreacting. However, if the husband felt like his partner was excluding him, that's a valid concern. Without more context, it's hard to say, but generally, being upset about not being included isn't considered the asshole unless there's a clear overreaction without reason.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because his feelings are valid if he felt excluded, especially if the wife didn't have a good reason. However, if the wife had a valid reason, the answer might be different, but since the scenario doesn't provide that, the default is B.\n"
