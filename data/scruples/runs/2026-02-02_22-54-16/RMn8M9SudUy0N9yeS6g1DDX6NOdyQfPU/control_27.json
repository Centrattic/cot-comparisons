      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong because his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The question is \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), so they want to know if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The husband wants to be present for the ultrasound to find out the baby's gender, but the wife is saying no. The husband is upset about this. \n\nWhy would the wife not want him there? Possible reasons could be discomfort with him seeing the gender first, maybe she wants to share the news in a specific way, or there could be some past issues. Without more context, it's hard to say. But generally, in many relationships, both parents are involved in such moments. The ultrasound is a medical procedure, and unless there's a medical reason or personal discomfort, it's usually something both parents attend.\n\nHowever, the wife might have her own reasons. Maybe she prefers to know first, or she's anxious about the procedure and wants her own support person, or perhaps there's a cultural or personal tradition they're following. For example, some people might prefer to share the news in a specific way, like through a party, and not want the husband to know beforehand.\n\nBut if the husband is being excluded without a clear reason, that might be a problem. Being a parent typically involves shared experiences, so not allowing the husband to be present could be seen as withholding an important moment. On the other hand, the wife has the right to make decisions about her body and her comfort, especially during a medical procedure.\n\nI should check if there's any cultural or legal context that might affect this. In most cases, unless there's a restraining order or some other legal issue, both parents can attend. The key is whether there's mutual respect and communication. If the wife hasn't discussed her reasons, or if the husband feels his parental involvement is being denied without cause, that could be a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of the husband's reaction, being upset is understandable if he feels excluded from a significant event in their child's life. However, if the wife has valid reasons for not wanting him there, the husband might need to respect that. Without more info, it's a bit of a toss-up. But generally, if there's no harm in him attending, and the wife is arbitrarily excluding him without explanation, then the husband's upset is justified. But if the wife has her reasons, even if they're not communicated clearly, the husband might need to address that through discussion rather than public shaming.\n\nSo the answer depends on the context. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the scenario is presented as the wife not allowing, the answer could lean either way. However, given that the husband is being excluded from a shared parental experience without stated reasons, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the wife has good reasons, then maybe the author is being unreasonable. Since we don't know the reasons, but the husband's upset is about being excluded, the default might be that the author isn't in the wrong. So maybe answer B (No).\n"
