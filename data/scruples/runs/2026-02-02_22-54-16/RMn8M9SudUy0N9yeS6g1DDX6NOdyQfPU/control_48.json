The question is AITA (Am I the Asshole), so they want to know if he's the one at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to think about typical scenarios like this. In many relationships, both partners usually go to prenatal appointments. The gender reveal ultrasound is a big moment, so it's understandable that the husband would want to be there. But maybe there's a reason the wife didn't invite him? Like maybe she wanted to surprise him later, or there was a medical reason she preferred to go alone? Or perhaps there was a misunderstanding or a past issue?\n\nBut the husband's reaction is being upset. If the wife didn't communicate her reasons clearly, maybe he's just reacting to not being included. On the other hand, if the wife had a valid reason, maybe the husband is overreacting. However, the standard assumption here might be that both partners should be involved in such a significant event. If the wife unilaterally decided without discussing, that could be the issue. But without more context, it's hard to say. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset. Since he's the one expressing his feelings about being excluded, and unless there's a reason the wife had to go alone (which isn't mentioned here), the husband's upset is a reasonable reaction. So the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
