      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. So, first, I need to consider the scenario. The husband wants to be there, but the wife says no. Why would that be the case? Maybe it's a personal choice, or maybe there's some medical reason, but the question is from the husband's perspective.\n\nIn many cultures, gender reveal ultrasounds are a common event where parents might choose to find out the baby's gender. Typically, both parents are involved, so not being allowed to attend seems odd. But maybe the wife has her reasons. Could be she wants to surprise him, or maybe she had a bad experience before, or perhaps she's uncomfortable with him knowing in advance. Alternatively, maybe there's a medical reason the doctor advised against it. However, the husband is upset, so from his viewpoint, he feels excluded from an important moment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to think about societal norms and typical reactions. Generally, in modern times, both parents are involved in such decisions. If the wife is making a unilateral decision without considering his feelings, that could be problematic. However, the wife has her own reasons, and as long as they're not harmful, she might have the right to make that choice. But the husband's reaction is understandable because he's being excluded from a significant part of the pregnancy experience.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife's reason is valid (like personal preference or medical advice), then the husband's upset might be seen as unreasonable. However, if the wife didn't communicate properly or if there's a lack of mutual respect, then maybe the wife is at fault. The question doesn't provide additional context, so we have to assume the wife's reason is valid. In that case, the husband might be in the wrong for being upset without understanding her perspective. However, if the husband's exclusion is causing emotional distress because he values being involved, then perhaps he's not in the wrong. \n\nWait, but the question is if the author (the husband) is in the wrong. If the wife has a legitimate reason, then the husband could be in the wrong for being upset. However, if the reason isn't given, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong because he's being excluded without explanation. But the scenario doesn't specify any reason from the wife's side. So without context, it's hard to say. However, in typical AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is in the wrong if they're not considering the other's perspective. But since the wife is the one not allowing, the husband's upset is a reaction. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because it's a mutual decision that should involve both. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the answer is B because he's not wrong for being upset about being excluded from an important event. However, if the wife had valid reasons, then maybe he is. But without knowing the wife's reasons, it's unclear. But in the absence of information, the default might be to side with the husband being not in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
