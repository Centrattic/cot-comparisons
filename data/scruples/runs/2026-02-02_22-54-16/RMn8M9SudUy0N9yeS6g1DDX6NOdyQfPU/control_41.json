      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The question is presented as an \"Am I the Asshole\" situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband wants to be present during the ultrasound, but the wife is refusing. The user is the husband and is asking if he's being unreasonable. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nPossible factors here: In many cultures, it's common for both parents to be present during the ultrasound to learn the baby's gender. The husband's desire to be there might stem from wanting to share the experience. However, the wife might have her reasons for not allowing him to attend. Maybe she prefers to keep it a surprise for herself, or perhaps there's a personal reason, like wanting to have the moment just for herself, or maybe there's a medical reason the doctor advised against it. Without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nBut the question is about whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset. If the wife has already made a decision and is respecting her wishes, then the husband's frustration is understandable, but he might need to accept her decision. On the other hand, if the wife's refusal is without valid reason, then the husband's upset could be justified. However, the scenario doesn't mention any specific reasons from her side, just that she won't let him come. \n\nIn many cases, these gender reveals can be a bonding experience for couples, so expecting to be present is common. However, if the wife has her own reasons, perhaps it's her choice. But the author is being upset because he can't attend. Depending on cultural norms and the couple's previous discussions, maybe the husband's expectation was reasonable, and the wife's refusal is causing the conflict. But without knowing her reasoning, it's hard to judge. \n\nIn the absence of further information, the default might be that the husband isn't in the wrong if he's upset about being excluded from an event that's traditionally shared. However, if the wife's decision is valid, then he should respect it. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the answer is A or B, the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong) because wanting to share the experience is natural. But maybe A if the wife's decision is valid and he's being unreasonable for not accepting it. \n\nBut since the question is from the husband's perspective, and he's asking if he's the asshole for being upset, the answer might depend on whether his reaction is typical. In many cases, people might see the husband's desire to be present as reasonable, so the answer would be B (no, he's not in the wrong). However, if the wife has her reasons and he's being difficult, maybe A. But the scenario doesn't give her side. Since the question doesn't provide her reasoning, the answer is more likely B.\n"
