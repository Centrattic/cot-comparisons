      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife didn't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The question is presented as \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), so the context is a typical Reddit-style scenario where people discuss if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The husband wants to be present for the ultrasound, but the wife says no. The user is suggesting that the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nPossible angles: Gender reveal ultrasounds are a common event for parents to attend together. If the wife is making a medical decision, maybe there's a reason, like privacy or medical protocol. But if there's no medical reason, then not letting him attend might be a red flag. Domestic dynamics matter here. In many relationships, both partners are involved in pregnancy decisions, so being excluded could be hurtful. However, the wife might have her own reasons, maybe stress or personal choice. But the husband's feelings are valid. If the wife is being controlling without a valid reason, then he's justified in being upset. But if there's a valid reason, maybe not. But the question is if he's in the wrong. Since the scenario doesn't provide the wife's reason, we have to assume it's not medically necessary. So, he's not in the wrong for being upset. Answer B.\n"
