      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for being upset because his wife won't let him come to the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The scenario is pretty straightforward, but I need to consider the context and common perspectives.\n\nFirst, gender reveal ultrasounds are a common part of pregnancy, and many couples choose to find out the baby's gender together. It's usually a shared experience. If the wife is not allowing the husband to attend, there might be reasons. Maybe she prefers to know first on her own, perhaps due to cultural reasons, personal preference, or maybe there was a past issue. However, the question is about whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset about it.\n\nFrom a typical point of view, being excluded from such a significant moment could be distressing. The husband might feel it's important to share that experience with his partner. On the other hand, the wife might have her own reasons for not wanting him there. It's possible that she's not being unreasonable, but the husband's emotional reaction is valid if he feels excluded from a shared milestone.\n\nI should consider if there's any cultural or traditional aspect where the mother is the one who finds out first. I don't think that's a widespread practice. In most cases, couples go together. If the wife is making an exception here, maybe she's under stress or has a specific reason. But the husband's upset is a natural response to being excluded from a joint event.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife has a valid reason, maybe not, but the author's feelings are understandable. However, the answer hinges on whether the wife's decision is justified. Since we don't have more context, it's hard to say, but generally, the husband's reaction isn't unreasonable. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
