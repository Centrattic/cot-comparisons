      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him come to the newborn gender reveal ultrasound. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author wants to attend the ultrasound to find out the baby's gender, but the wife says no. The author is upset about this. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI should think about typical gender roles and expectations. In some cultures, the gender reveal is a big event, and some people might feel included or excluded based on whether they're present. The husband might feel left out if he's not allowed to be there. But then again, maybe the wife has her reasons. Perhaps she wants to keep it a surprise for a bigger occasion, or maybe there's a tradition in their family where the mother alone knows first.\n\nBut wait, isn't the husband usually present for ultrasounds? I mean, it's their baby, so both parents might want to share that experience. If the wife is making him not attend, maybe she's being exclusionary. But why would she do that? Maybe she wants to surprise him later, or maybe there's a medical reason. The problem is we don't have details here. The user is asking for a general judgment.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both parents should be involved in the pregnancy milestones. If the wife is preventing the husband from attending a routine ultrasound, that could be seen as unreasonable. Unless there's a specific reason, like a cultural tradition or a personal choice she has the right to make. But the husband's right to be present should also be considered. \n\nHowever, without more context, it's hard to say. The wife might have valid reasons, but the husband's feelings are also valid. If the husband is being excluded without a good reason, then he might not be in the wrong. But if the wife has a legitimate reason, maybe the husband is overreacting.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the situation. Since there's no clear wrongdoing mentioned from the husband's side, just that he's upset about not being allowed to attend, I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The wife's decision could be arbitrary, and the husband's desire to be present is reasonable. So the answer might be B (No). But I need to be careful. Maybe in some cases, the wife has the right to decide who's present during medical procedures. But ultrasounds are usually shared moments. So I think the answer is B.\n"
