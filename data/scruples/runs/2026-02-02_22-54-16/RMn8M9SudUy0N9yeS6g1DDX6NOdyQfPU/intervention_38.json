      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person is upset because their wife won't let them come to the newborn gender reveal ultrasound. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. A gender reveal ultrasound is typically a time when parents find out the baby's gender. Usually, both parents attend this appointment, so it's a shared experience. If the wife is not allowing the husband to be there, that could be for various reasons. Maybe she wanted to have the moment to herself, or perhaps there was a specific reason like a hospital policy, or maybe a personal preference.\n\nThe author is upset about being excluded. Is that justified? Well, the husband has a right to be part of the pregnancy experience. Being present at the ultrasound is a common way for both parents to bond and share in the excitement. If the wife decided not to include him without a good reason, that might be where the issue lies. \n\nBut maybe there was a valid reason. For example, if the ultrasound was done in a setting where only the mother was present for privacy, or if there was a previous agreement that the husband would find out separately. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. \n\nI think it's reasonable for the husband to be upset if he wasn't included without a good explanation. Excluding a partner from such a significant moment could feel dismissive or disrespectful. Unless the wife had a legitimate reason, like a medical one, the husband's reaction seems justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
