      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The question is whether he's the \"asshole\" here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The situation is about a couple where the wife is deciding not to let the husband be present during the gender reveal ultrasound. The husband is upset about this. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners want to be involved in key moments, like finding out the baby's gender. It's a significant event, and being excluded can cause feelings of hurt or being undervalued. The husband's reaction is understandable if he feels left out. However, the wife might have her reasons\u2014maybe she wants it to be a surprise for him, or she prefers to go alone for personal reasons. \n\nBut the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset. If he's expressing his feelings and seeking a discussion about why he's being excluded, that's reasonable. On the other hand, if he's being confrontational or disrespectful, that's different. The scenario as presented doesn't mention any negative behavior from him beyond being upset, so he's probably just reacting emotionally to a situation where he feels excluded. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for both parents to attend the ultrasound together. If the wife is making a unilateral decision without considering his feelings, that could be an issue. However, if there's a cultural or personal reason she's doing this, maybe it's a tradition or she's trying to create a special moment for him later. \n\nBut the husband's right to be upset isn't necessarily wrong. Emotional reactions are valid unless they're expressed in a harmful way. The key here is whether the husband's reaction is disproportionate or if he's respecting her decision while still expressing his feelings. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the scenario doesn't indicate that he's acting in a way that's hurtful, it's likely that he's not in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong for being upset about being excluded from the ultrasound if it's affecting his emotional well-being. It's important for couples to communicate and find a compromise, but the initial upset isn't wrong.\n"
