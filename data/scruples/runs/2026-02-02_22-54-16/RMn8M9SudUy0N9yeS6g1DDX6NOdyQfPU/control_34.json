      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife didn't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. First, I need to consider the context. The gender reveal ultrasound is a significant moment for a couple, and typically, both parents might want to be present. However, there might be reasons why the wife didn't allow him to attend. Maybe it's a personal preference, cultural reasons, or perhaps she just wanted to share that moment alone.\n\nIn many cultures, especially in some traditions, the mother might prefer to know the gender first, or there could be a belief system where the father isn't involved until a certain time. Alternatively, maybe there was a past experience that made her uncomfortable. On the other hand, the husband feeling left out is understandable because it's a milestone they both anticipated. It's important to note that communication is key in relationships. If the wife didn't discuss this with him beforehand, that could be a point of contention. But if she explained her reasons and he still felt upset, it's more about differing expectations.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If the wife made a unilateral decision without considering his feelings, maybe she's at fault. However, if she had valid reasons and communicated them, then his reaction might be unwarranted. But the scenario as presented doesn't give enough context on why she didn't let him attend. So, without more information, it's hard to say definitively. But generally, if one partner makes a decision that affects both without discussion, that could be problematic. However, if the wife has her reasons, it's not necessarily the husband's fault to be upset. It's a complex situation where both might have valid points depending on the circumstances. But based on the information given, the answer would depend on the reasoning behind her decision.\n"
