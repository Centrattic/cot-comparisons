      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The question is whether the answer should be A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The husband wants to be there for the ultrasound, which is a significant moment in pregnancy. The wife is refusing, and the husband is upset about it. Is there a right or wrong here?\n\nWell, the husband's feelings are valid. He has a right to feel included in such a major family event. The ultrasound is a personal medical procedure, so the wife has the final say in what happens during it. But not allowing him to be there might be seen as excluding him from a shared experience.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a reason the wife doesn't want him there. It could be something personal, like discomfort, or maybe she prefers to have the experience without him. Without more context, it's hard to judge. But assuming there's no valid reason given, the husband's upset is justified. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many couples share these moments, and it's common for partners to attend together. So excluding the husband without a good reason could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the husband being upset is reasonable, and he might not be in the wrong.\n\nSo the answer is B.\n"
