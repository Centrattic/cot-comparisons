      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're at fault for being upset their wife didn't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is a husband who wanted to be present for the ultrasound but wasn't allowed by his wife. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset about that. \n\nI know that in many relationships, decisions about medical appointments can vary. Sometimes, for various reasons, one partner might prefer the other not to be present. Maybe the wife was uncomfortable, maybe there were medical reasons, or perhaps it was a personal choice she made. But the husband is upset because he wasn't included. \n\nFrom a general perspective, being excluded from a significant family event could be hurtful. The ultrasound is a key moment in pregnancy, and not being allowed to attend might make the husband feel left out. However, the wife's reasons for not allowing him could be valid too. For example, maybe she wanted to go with a friend, felt more comfortable without him, or there was a misunderstanding about scheduling. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband's reaction is justified. If the wife had a legitimate reason, perhaps the husband's upset is understandable but not necessarily his fault. On the other hand, if the wife's refusal was without valid reason and the husband has a right to be present, then maybe the wife is in the wrong. But since the question is about the husband being in the wrong, we need to see if his being upset is misplaced.\n\nIn many cultures, especially in the West, there's a trend towards shared parenting experiences, and partners are often encouraged to attend prenatal appointments. So, if the wife refused without a clear reason, the husband might feel that his involvement is being denied. However, each partner has autonomy. The wife has the right to decide who accompanies her to appointments, even if it's a spouse. \n\nBut the husband's emotional response might be seen as reasonable if he felt it was important to be there. However, if the refusal was mutual or there was communication, maybe not. The lack of context here is a problem. The original post is very brief, so we don't know the full story. The wife might have had a good reason, like privacy, discomfort, or even a previous arrangement. \n\nSince the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his reaction is unjustified. If the wife had a valid reason, then the husband's upset might be understandable but not necessarily his fault. If there was no reason, then he might not be in the wrong. However, without knowing the wife's reasons, it's hard to say definitively. \n\nIn the absence of specific information about the wife's motives, the default assumption might be that the husband has a right to be upset if he felt excluded from a shared experience. However, the wife's autonomy is also important. This is a bit of a toss-up, but generally, in such cases, unless there's a clear violation of rights, the husband's upset might not make him the wrong one. Alternatively, if the wife's decision was based on personal choice, the husband might need to respect that. \n\nBut the question is about the author being in the wrong. If the wife's choice was legitimate, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. If the wife had no valid reason, then maybe the author is justified. Since the scenario doesn't provide the wife's reasons, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong simply for feeling upset about being excluded. Therefore, the answer might be B (No). However, another angle is that the husband should respect his wife's decision without being upset, but that's more about emotional regulation. \n\nIn many \"Am I the Asshole?\" situations, the answer depends on societal norms and norms of relationships. Typically, both partners have the right to make such decisions, and if the wife chose not to include the husband, even if it's hurtful, she's not necessarily wrong. Therefore, the husband's being upset isn't necessarily his fault. So, the answer is B.\n"
