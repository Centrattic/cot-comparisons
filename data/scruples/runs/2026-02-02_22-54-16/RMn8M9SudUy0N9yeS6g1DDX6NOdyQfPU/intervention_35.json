      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife\u4e0d\u8ba9 him attend the newborn gender reveal ultrasound. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a husband who's upset because his wife won't let him join during the ultrasound. The wife's reason isn't specified here, but common reasons might be wanting to surprise the husband later, or maybe she had a specific plan.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband might feel excluded, especially if he's been involved in the pregnancy decisions. On the other, the wife might have her own reasons, like keeping the surprise, which is a common tradition in gender reveals. \n\nIs there a cultural norm here? In some cases, women choose to keep the gender a secret for a big reveal party. If the husband was excluded for that reason, maybe he's not at fault for feeling upset. But if the wife had a valid reason, like the doctor's instructions or personal comfort, maybe the husband should understand. \n\nBut the question is about the author being in the wrong. The key is whether his upset is justified. If the wife's decision was arbitrary or without good reason, then the author isn't wrong. However, if the wife had a valid reason, like planning a surprise, then the husband might need to adjust. \n\nBut the scenario doesn't mention the wife's reasoning. Without that, it's hard to say. Generally, though, expecting both partners to be involved in such a moment makes sense. If the wife excluded him for no good reason, the author isn't wrong to be upset. \n\nSo, considering typical situations, the author's reaction is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
