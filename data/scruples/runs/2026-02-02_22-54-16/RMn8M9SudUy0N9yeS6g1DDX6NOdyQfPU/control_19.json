      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In many cultures, especially in the U.S., it's common for both parents to be present during an ultrasound. The gender reveal is often a shared experience. If the wife is preventing the husband from attending, there might be reasons, but the husband's reaction could be seen as valid if he feels excluded from an important moment.\n\nBut maybe the wife has her own reasons. Sometimes, for example, the doctor might prefer only the mother to hear certain information first, or there might be past issues. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Without more context, the husband feeling upset is understandable. Being a parent is a team effort, and sharing such moments is important. If the wife is making a unilateral decision without discussing it, that could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife has a valid reason, but the husband's reaction is still justified in feeling upset. The key here is whether the husband's reaction is reasonable. If the wife is being unreasonable in excluding him without a good reason, then he's not in the wrong. But if there's a medical or personal reason, the husband might need to understand that. Since the post doesn't provide those details, the default assumption is that the husband's distress is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
