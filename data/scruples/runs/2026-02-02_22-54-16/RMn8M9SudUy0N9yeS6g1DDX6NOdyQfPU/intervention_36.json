      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my opinion. So I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, I should consider the scenario. A gender reveal ultrasound is typically a bonding experience for parents. It's a moment where they find out the baby's gender, and usually, both parents are present. If the wife is preventing the husband from attending, that could be a point of contention. But why would she not want him there? Maybe there's a personal reason, like she wanted to keep it a secret for a party or something. But that's speculative.\n\nThe key here is the husband's right to be involved in the pregnancy decisions. In many relationships, major decisions about the baby, including medical procedures, are made jointly. If the wife is making a decision that affects both of them without including him, that could be an issue. The husband feeling upset is a valid emotional response. He might feel excluded from an important moment, which is a common reaction when a partner makes unilateral decisions.\n\nHowever, there could be reasons why the wife didn't want him there. Maybe she wanted to plan a surprise for a gender reveal party, which sometimes people do. If that's the case, maybe it's not about excluding him but about planning a surprise. But even then, she could have discussed it with him first. Surprises are okay if both parties are on board. If she didn't communicate her intentions, that might be the problem.\n\nAnother angle is communication. If the husband wasn't aware of the plan to keep it a secret, then the wife might be at fault for not discussing it with him. On the other hand, if he was aware and it's about her choice to not let him attend for another reason, that's different. The question doesn't specify the reason, so we have to go with the given information: the wife won't let him come, and he's upset.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, expecting both parents to be involved in such medical appointments is common. The husband's reaction is about feeling left out of a significant moment. Unless there's a valid medical or personal reason (like the doctor only allows one parent for some reason), the wife's decision could be seen as disregarding his feelings. However, without more context, it's hard to say if the wife's reasoning is valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband feeling upset is a reasonable response. The wife's decision to exclude him might be wrong if there's no good reason. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
