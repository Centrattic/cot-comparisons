      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him come to the gender reveal ultrasound of their newborn. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a husband who wanted to attend the ultrasound, but his wife said no. He's upset about it and is asking if he's the asshole (AITA). The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong, with options A or B.\n\nNow, I have to consider common scenarios. In many cases, gender reveal ultrasounds are private moments that some partners prefer to keep to themselves. The wife might have her reasons\u2014maybe she wants to surprise her husband, or she's uncomfortable having him there for some reason. On the other hand, the husband might feel excluded or not involved in the process, which is a valid feeling.\n\nI should think about societal norms. It's not uncommon for one partner to want to share the gender during the ultrasound while the other prefers to wait. If the wife had already made plans to surprise him later, then she might be justified. However, if the husband was looking forward to sharing that moment and it wasn't part of a surprise, the wife's refusal could be seen as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nAlso, communication is key here. If the husband had discussed his feelings with his wife beforehand, maybe they could have found a compromise. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, I need to assess if his reaction is reasonable.\n\nIn some cases, people might see the husband's reaction as being dramatic, especially if the wife's reason is valid. But others might argue that sharing the moment of learning the baby's gender is important for both parents. The answer might depend on the context of their relationship and previous agreements.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to say. The question is a yes or no based on the given info. Since the wife's refusal could have legitimate reasons (like wanting a surprise), the husband's upset might be unwarranted. However, if the husband felt excluded without a valid reason, he might not be in the wrong.\n\nBut the question is about the author being in the wrong. If the wife's decision is reasonable (e.g., surprise plans), then the husband's upset reaction could be seen as the problem. Hence, answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But if the husband's feelings are valid and the wife didn't consider his feelings, then answer B (No).\n\nSince the scenario doesn't mention any prior issues or agreements, I have to assume the wife's reason is her right to choose, perhaps for a surprise. Therefore, the husband's being upset might not be justified. So answer A.\n"
