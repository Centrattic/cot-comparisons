      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong because their wife won't let them come to the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The title is \"AITA For being upset...\" which stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" So the author is expressing being upset about not being allowed to attend the ultrasound.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Gender reveal ultrasounds are a big moment for many couples. Traditionally, some people choose to keep the gender a secret until a specific event, which might be a family gathering or a special party. However, in other cases, the ultrasound is just a medical procedure where the gender is revealed, and both parents are usually present. \n\nThe key here is why the wife is not allowing the husband to attend. The post doesn't provide specific reasons, so I have to make some assumptions. Maybe the wife wants to surprise the husband, which is a common reason. If that's the case, the husband's upset reaction might be because he values being included, while the wife wants to create a special moment. In such scenarios, it's more about differing expectations rather than one party being wrong. \n\nAnother angle is the wife's intentions. If she's not allowing him for a valid reason, like to prevent stress or for medical advice (though that's less common for a gender reveal), then maybe there's a different motive. But the post doesn't mention any such factors. Without more info, the default assumption is that she wants to surprise him. \n\nThe husband being upset is a natural reaction if he felt excluded. However, if the wife had communicated her desire to keep it a secret until a later event, and the husband had agreed, then he might be overstepping by being upset. But again, the post doesn't mention prior communication. It just states the situation. \n\nIn many cases, these gender reveals are a way for one parent to feel like they're keeping a secret to make the reveal more exciting. The husband's frustration might stem from not being part of that moment, which is understandable. But the wife's choice to surprise him could be seen as a gesture of love and planning a special event. \n\nWithout knowing if there was a mutual agreement or if the wife's decision was reasonable, it's hard to say. But generally, people have different preferences here. The husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to be there, but the wife's decision to surprise him isn't necessarily wrong either. The problem might lie in the lack of communication. If the husband didn't know about the plan to surprise him, he might have a valid reason to be upset. However, if the wife had a plan and the husband respected it, then maybe he's overreacting. \n\nGiven the limited information, the most balanced answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The wife's choice to surprise him isn't inherently wrong, but the author's upset reaction is a personal feeling that might be valid if he wasn't expecting the gender to be a surprise. The situation could be a matter of differing expectations rather than one person being right or wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
