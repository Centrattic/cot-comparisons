The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is upset that they can't attend the ultrasound, and the question is whether they're at fault. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should ideally be included in major decisions, especially regarding their child. The gender reveal is a significant moment for both parents. If the wife is preventing the husband from attending, that might be a red flag. However, sometimes there are medical reasons, but the husband might not know about them. \n\nBut generally, couples should be on the same page. If the wife is excluding him without a valid reason, then she might be in the wrong. The husband being upset is a natural reaction. So, the author isn't wrong for feeling upset. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
