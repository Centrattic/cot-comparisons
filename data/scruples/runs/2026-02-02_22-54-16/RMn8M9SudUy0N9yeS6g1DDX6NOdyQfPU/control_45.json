      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. Hmm. First, I need to understand the situation. The author wants to be present, but his wife is keeping it a secret, maybe for tradition or personal reasons.\n\nNow, is there a right or wrong here? Well, it depends on the context. Some couples choose to keep the gender secret as a surprise, often for a party or just tradition. If the wife had planned this and communicated her wishes beforehand, maybe the husband didn't have a say. But if there was no prior discussion, then the husband might feel left out. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual agreement. If the wife didn't discuss this with him and just decided on her own, that's a problem. But if they had talked about it and he agreed, then maybe he's overreacting. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, being excluded from such a significant moment could be hurtful. The husband has a right to feel involved in his child's life. On the other hand, the wife's decision might be based on her own reasons. But the fact that he's upset suggests that his feelings weren't considered. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong because it's a shared experience, and both parents should be part of such important moments. Unless there was a prior agreement, excluding him without reason could be seen as unfair. So, the answer is B.\n"
