      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for being upset that their wife wouldn't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants another perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is a husband who's upset about not being allowed to attend the ultrasound. The wife is the one making the decision here. Why would she not let him come? Possible reasons could be privacy, personal space for her, maybe she wanted to keep it a surprise for others, or perhaps there's some underlying tension. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners have the right to be involved in important moments. The ultrasound is a significant event, and not being invited might make the husband feel excluded. However, the wife might have her reasons. For example, maybe she wanted to go with another family member, or maybe there were logistical reasons like the doctor prefers only the pregnant person. \n\nBut generally, unless there's a specific reason that excludes the husband, like medical necessity or personal boundaries he's already agreed to, it's reasonable for him to be upset. Being a parent usually involves shared experiences. If the wife is making unilateral decisions without considering his feelings, that could be an issue. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife had a valid reason and communicated it clearly, maybe the husband's reaction is unwarranted. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset. The key here is communication. If the wife didn't explain her reasons, his feelings of being left out are valid. \n\nSo, considering typical relationship dynamics, the husband's upset is understandable. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Unless there's more context suggesting the husband's reaction is unreasonable, like prior arguments or unreasonable demands, the default is that he's justified in feeling upset when a major family event is excluded without explanation.\n"
