      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife didn't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband wants to be there for the ultrasound, but the wife says no. The question is whether he's at fault for being upset about it.\n\nHmm, so why would the wife not let him come? Maybe there's a reason, like the doctor prefers only one parent present, or maybe it's a cultural thing where the mother gets to find out first. Alternatively, maybe the wife wanted to keep it a surprise for herself. But the husband is upset because he wasn't included.\n\nIn many cases, couples share the gender reveal together. If the wife decided to do it without him, perhaps without a clear reason, that could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. On the other hand, if there's a valid reason, like medical protocol or a personal choice she made, maybe he needs to respect that. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's upset is justified. If the wife didn't provide a valid reason, then the husband might be justified. But if the wife had a reason, maybe he's overreacting. However, the question is from the husband's perspective, so we don't know the wife's reasoning. In the absence of a given reason, it's possible that the husband's feelings are valid. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's upset about being excluded from a shared family moment, which is reasonable. Unless there's a specific justification from the wife, which isn't mentioned here.\n"
