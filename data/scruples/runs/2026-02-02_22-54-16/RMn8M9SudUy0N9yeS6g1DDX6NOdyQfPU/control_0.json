      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. A gender reveal ultrasound is a common event where parents find out the baby's sex. Normally, both parents attend together, but sometimes there might be reasons one can't be there. Maybe the wife wanted to surprise the husband, or perhaps there was a medical reason. But the husband is upset because he wasn't included.\n\nWait, why wouldn't she let him come? That part is unclear. The original question doesn't give more details. Maybe the wife planned a surprise, like hiding the gender from him until a party or something. But not being there for the ultrasound could be a big deal. The husband might feel left out or not trusted. On the other hand, the wife might think it's a way to have a special moment with the healthcare provider or for personal reasons.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. If the wife didn't explain her reasons, maybe the husband's upset is valid because he wasn't involved in a shared experience. But if the wife had her own reasons and communicated them, then maybe the husband is overreacting. However, the question doesn't mention the wife's reasons. Without knowing her side, it's hard to say. But the general expectation is that both parents would attend the ultrasound together. If she refused without a good reason, the husband might be justified in being upset. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I should also consider cultural norms. Some people do gender reveals as surprises, but the ultrasound itself is usually a shared event. If the wife is keeping it secret, maybe the husband feels excluded. So I think the answer is B.\n"
