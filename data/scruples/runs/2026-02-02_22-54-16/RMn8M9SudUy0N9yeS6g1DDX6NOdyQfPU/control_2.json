      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a husband who wanted to be present at the ultrasound to find out the baby's gender. His wife decided not to let him come, and he's upset about that. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nHmm. Well, gender reveal is a personal choice for the parents. Some couples choose to find out the gender together, others prefer one parent to know first. If the wife made the decision not to include him, maybe she has her reasons. But is the author wrong to be upset?\n\nI think it's about mutual respect. If the wife made a unilateral decision without considering his feelings, that could be an issue. On the other hand, if she had her own reasons, like wanting to keep it a surprise or different personal preferences, maybe the author is overreacting. But he has a right to feel included in the experience. So, if the wife didn't communicate her reasons or dismiss his feelings, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if he's being unreasonable about it, maybe there's a different take.\n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's upset because he wasn't consulted or included in the decision, then he might have a valid point. But if the wife made the decision for legitimate reasons and he's being overly upset without trying to understand her perspective, that could be his fault. But without more context, it's hard to say. Typically, such decisions should be mutual. If she decided alone, perhaps she's in the wrong. But if he's reacting in a way that's disrespectful or causing conflict, maybe he's at fault.\n\nBut the scenario is just that he's upset. He might just feel excluded. In that case, being upset isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset if his wife didn't involve him in the decision. The problem could be on her side for not discussing it. Unless there's a cultural or personal norm that the wife has a right to make such decisions, but generally, major pregnancy decisions are joint.\n"
