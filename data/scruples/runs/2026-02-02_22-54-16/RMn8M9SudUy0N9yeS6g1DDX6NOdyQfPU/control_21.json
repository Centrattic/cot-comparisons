      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault because their wife didn't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The situation is pretty straightforward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, it's common for both parents to be present during ultrasounds. However, there might be exceptions if there are medical reasons or if the wife prefers to go alone for some personal reason. But the question is about the author being in the wrong.\n\nThe key here is understanding the context. If the author was not invited, maybe the wife had her own reasons. But unless there's a specific reason given, like medical necessity or personal preference, the author might feel left out. However, the wife has the right to make decisions about her own medical appointments, including who accompanies her.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. If the wife did not include him without a valid reason, then the author's feelings are valid. However, if the wife had a good reason, like wanting privacy or medical advice, then the author might be in the wrong for feeling upset. Since the scenario doesn't mention any specific reasons from the wife, it's hard to say. But generally, the wife's autonomy in her medical decisions is important. However, the author's feelings can be hurt if excluded without explanation. But in the absence of a medical reason, the wife's choice to go alone might not be wrong, but the author's upset is also understandable. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. Since being upset is a natural reaction, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But maybe the wife's decision is valid. Hmm. This is tricky. The answer would depend on the reason. Since there's no reason given, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe the answer is B, no. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the wife made a choice, the author isn't wrong for being upset. So answer B.\n"
