      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The husband wants to be present for the ultrasound, but the wife says no. He's upset about it. The key here is understanding why the wife might not want him there. Gender reveal parties are usually for friends and family to find out the baby's gender together, but an ultrasound is a medical procedure. Sometimes, people choose to keep the gender secret until the party, so the husband might not be allowed to know in advance. \n\nBut if the husband wants to be there for the medical reason and the wife is denying him access, maybe she's keeping it a secret for the party. However, the husband's right to be present during the procedure could be a point. In many cases, spouses are allowed to attend prenatal appointments and ultrasounds unless there's a specific reason to exclude them. So if the wife is preventing him for the sake of the gender reveal, that might not be fair to him. \n\nOn the other hand, if they had agreed beforehand that the husband wouldn't know until the party, then the husband might be in the wrong for being upset. But the question is about the scenario where there's no mention of prior agreement. Without prior discussion, the husband's desire to be present is valid. The wife might be overstepping by denying him access without a clear reason. \n\nSo, considering that the husband has a right to be involved in the pregnancy and medical procedures, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Unless there's a specific reason the wife has to keep it secret, like a planned gender reveal event, but even then, the husband's inclusion is important. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
