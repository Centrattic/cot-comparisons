      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife won't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband wants to be present for the ultrasound, but the wife says no. The husband is upset about this. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nWell, in many relationships, both partners want to share important moments like a gender reveal. It's a significant event for both parents. If the wife is making a unilateral decision without considering his feelings, that could be an issue. But maybe there's a reason she doesn't want him there. Maybe she's uncomfortable, or there's a medical reason, or maybe it's a personal preference. Without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, if the husband's desire to attend is reasonable and the wife is dismissing his feelings without a valid reason, then she might be in the wrong. On the other hand, if the wife has valid reasons and the husband is being inconsiderate of her wishes, then he might be at fault. But the question is about the husband being in the wrong. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset. The husband's feelings are valid; he might feel excluded. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe the act of being upset is justified if the wife's reasoning isn't communicated or is unfair. Without more info, it's tricky. But generally, in such situations, both partners should communicate and compromise. If the wife's refusal is without a good reason, the husband's upset is understandable. But if there's a reason, maybe he's overreacting. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B, No, because the husband's feelings are valid and being excluded from such a moment is a legitimate concern. Unless there's a specific reason given by the wife that's not mentioned here, the husband isn't necessarily wrong for being upset.\n"
