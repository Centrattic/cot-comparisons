      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for being upset that their wife won't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Gender reveal ultrasounds are a common part of pregnancy. Traditionally, the wife might go first to see the gender without the partner, which can be a bonding experience for the mother with the baby. However, the father usually attends the actual ultrasound appointment. Maybe the wife wants to keep the gender a surprise for a bigger reveal later, so she's not allowing the husband to be present during that specific part. \n\nThe author is upset because he's excluded. But is he in the wrong? Well, it's the wife's choice how she wants to handle the gender reveal. If she wants to keep it a secret for a party or something, that's her decision. The ultrasound itself is medical, so he might have the right to be there, but the gender reveal part could be a personal choice. However, in many cases, couples attend together. Maybe the wife is doing this to have a personal moment with the baby first. \n\nI should check if there's any cultural or medical norms here. In some places, the mother might prefer to have the gender revealed privately. The husband might feel left out, but if the wife isn't being unreasonable or abusive, then maybe he's not in the wrong. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife is making a personal choice, then the husband's upset could be valid, but maybe not justified. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband was expecting to be there and the wife didn't communicate her reasons. If she's being dismissive, that's different. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The question is if the author is in the wrong. Since it's about a personal decision by the wife to keep the gender a secret for herself, the author's upset might not make him wrong. Unless there's a clear expectation he should be excluded. But typically, the father is present for the ultrasound, so maybe the wife is making an exception here. \n\nHmm. The answer might depend on their communication and prior agreements. Since we don't have more info, the safest assumption is that the wife's choice isn't necessarily wrong, so the author's being upset isn't necessarily wrong either. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife has the right to make that decision, then the author isn't wrong for being upset, but maybe he's not in the wrong. Wait, AITA is about whether the person is in the wrong. If the wife is making a choice, and the author is upset, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
