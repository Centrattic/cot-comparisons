      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife wouldn't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. I need to figure out the answer based on the information given.\n\nFirst, the situation is that the husband wants to be present for the ultrasound, but the wife is refusing. The husband is upset about this. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I have to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. To determine if the author is wrong, I need to consider typical views on this matter. In many relationships, both parents want to be involved in such moments. The ultrasound is a significant and exciting part of pregnancy. If the wife is the one who wants to keep it a secret, maybe for a surprise or personal reasons, does that make the husband's upsetness wrong?\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a reason she doesn't want him there. Maybe she wants to surprise him later, or there's some medical reason. Without more context, it's hard to say. However, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset. Generally, if both parties have a right to their feelings, being upset over not being included in a significant event might not be wrong. The husband has a right to feel excluded. However, maybe in some relationships, the wife's autonomy is also important. But the question is about the husband's wrongness. If he's upset because he's excluded from a key moment, that's a valid reaction. Unless there's a valid reason for exclusion, like medical necessity or prior agreement, the husband isn't wrong. So the answer would be B. But I should make sure there's no hidden context. Since the user says the author isn't wrong, and the scenario is straightforward, I think B is correct.\n"
