      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife didn't let him attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Ultrasounds are usually a shared experience for parents. It's common for both partners to be present during such a significant moment. The husband is upset because he wasn't allowed to attend, which might indicate a lack of communication between the couple.\n\nNext, possible reasons why the wife didn't let him come: Maybe there were logistical issues, like the clinic's policy, or perhaps she made a decision without discussing it. If she didn't consult him, that could be the issue. On the other hand, if there were valid reasons (like the procedure being uncomfortable or risky for him to be there), that might be different, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nThe key here is whether the wife involved the husband in the decision-making. If she excluded him without a good reason, then she might be at fault. However, if there were specific circumstances, maybe the husband's presence wasn't appropriate. But since the scenario is just that the wife didn't let him come, and the husband is upset, the main issue is about communication and mutual respect.\n\nIn most cases, decisions about such events should be made together. The husband's reaction shows he feels excluded, which is a valid feeling. So, the wife might be in the wrong for not discussing the matter with him. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
