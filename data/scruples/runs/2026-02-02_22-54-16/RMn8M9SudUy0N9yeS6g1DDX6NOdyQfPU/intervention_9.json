      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the prompt is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is upset because their wife won't let them attend the newborn's gender reveal ultrasound. The author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical gender reveal practices. Usually, these are family events where parents decide who to include. Maybe the wife made a decision without consulting the husband, which could be seen as dismissive. But sometimes, there are practical reasons, like the ultrasound being more comfortable for the mother alone, or a surprise planned. However, the husband's feelings are valid if he wanted to be present. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? In some cultures, fathers might be involved in the ultrasound. If the wife excluded him without a good reason, that could be problematic. On the other hand, if there's a reason like a tradition of keeping it a surprise or personal choice, maybe not. The key is whether the exclusion was without justification.\n\nThe husband's right to be involved in such a significant event might be important. If the wife didn't communicate her reasons, that's a problem. But if she had a valid reason and he's still upset, maybe he should work through that. But the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because being upset about being excluded from a significant family event is understandable. Unless there's a specific reason given that justifies exclusion, the husband's feelings are valid. So answer B.\n"
