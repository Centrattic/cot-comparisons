      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for warning a guy about his date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the author is a waiter who notices a regular customer (a girl) comes in with different guys weekly. When she goes to the bathroom, he tells her current date that she's there often with different people and he should be careful. The date leaves quickly, and the girl complained, leading to the author getting written up. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nI need to determine if the author overstepped. As a waiter, their role is to serve, not to interfere in customers' personal lives. Even if the author's intention was to help, they didn't have the authority to mediate or warn someone about their date. The girl's complaint might be valid because the waiter crossed professional boundaries. But the author's motive was to protect the date from potential deceit. However, the method was inappropriate. The business likely has policies against employees interfering in customer relationships, which is why the boss took action.\n\nSo the answer hinges on professional conduct. Even if the intent was good, the action was unprofessional. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
