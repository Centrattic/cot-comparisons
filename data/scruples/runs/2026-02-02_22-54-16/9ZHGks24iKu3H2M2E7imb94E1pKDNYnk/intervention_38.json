The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the waiter is in the wrong for warning a guy about his date who comes in with different guys every week. The situation is that the waiter noticed the girl's pattern and told the date to be careful because she might not be faithful. The date left quickly, and the girl complained, leading to a write-up by the boss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the role of the waiter. Their job is to serve customers, not to act as a matchmaker or mediator. By intervening, the waiter is making a personal judgment and sharing it with a customer. That could be seen as overstepping their professional boundaries. Even if the waiter's intention was to help, they might have violated the restaurant's policies on customer interactions.\n\nThen, there's the issue of privacy and consent. The waiter has no right to disclose information about a customer's behavior unless it's part of their job, like reporting harassment. The girl's actions, if they're just frequent dates, might not be illegal or unethical, but the waiter's disclosure could be considered an invasion of her privacy. The date might have felt uncomfortable, but that's not the waiter's role to handle.\n\nAlso, the boss wrote the waiter up, which suggests that the restaurant has rules against such behavior. Employees are typically expected to avoid getting involved in customers' personal matters to prevent conflicts and maintain a professional environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the waiter might argue they were being a good person, trying to prevent someone from being hurt. However, that's not a valid excuse in a professional setting. The right answer would be that the waiter overstepped their role, leading to a breach of confidentiality and possibly discrimination if the assessment was incorrect.\n\nSo, the waiter is in the wrong because they interfered in a customer's personal life without justification and likely broke workplace policies. The answer should be A.\n"
