      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the waiter who warned a guy about his date was in the wrong. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" post. The waiter noticed a girl comes in with different guys every week and gives the same moves. When she went to the bathroom, he told the current date that she's there often with others, so he should be careful. The guy left quickly, and the girl complained, leading to the waiter being written up.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's correct. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the waiter's job is to serve customers, not to mediate their personal relationships. By intervening, he's stepping outside his role. The guy might have appreciated the warning, but the waiter could be overstepping. The girl's complaint makes sense because she might feel he's interfering in her personal life. The boss wrote him up because it's not part of his duties. So, professionally, the waiter was violating company policy by getting involved.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, is he right in trying to help? If the girl is indeed being disingenuous, maybe the waiter is trying to protect the guy. However, unless he has concrete evidence of her behavior, it's just his observation. The waiter's judgment might be based on his perception, not facts. Assuming she's acting in a certain way could be his bias. Also, the guy might have left because he felt uncomfortable being told that, regardless of the truth.\n\nSo, legally and professionally, the waiter is definitely in the wrong. The employer's policy likely prohibits such interference. Morally, it's a gray area. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering both aspects, the answer leans towards yes. The key here is that his job doesn't include giving relationship advice, and his actions led to a complaint and disciplinary action. Therefore, AITA? Answer A for yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
