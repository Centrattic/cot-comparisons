      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the waiter (the author) is in the wrong for warning a guy about his date. So the situation is: the waiter notices a girl who comes in with different guys every week and uses similar moves each time. When she goes to the bathroom, he tells the guy that she's here often with different guys and he should be careful. The guy leaves quickly, and the girl complained, leading to the waiter getting written up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the waiter overstepped his bounds. As a waiter, his job is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal relationships. Even if his intention was good\u2014to protect the guy from a potential situation\u2014the method might be inappropriate. He's sharing information about a customer's private behavior without her consent. That's a privacy issue. Also, he's making assumptions about her intentions. Maybe she's actually in a polyamorous relationship or just has a lot of friends. The waiter isn't in a position to judge or intervene. Plus, by doing this, he's creating a hostile environment for her, which could be seen as discriminatory or harassing. The boss writing him up is probably because of company policy against disclosing customer information and interfering in customer interactions. So, even if the intention was good, the action was unprofessional and violated privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
