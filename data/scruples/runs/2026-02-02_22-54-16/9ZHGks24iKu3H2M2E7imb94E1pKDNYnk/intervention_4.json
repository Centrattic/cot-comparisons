There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a waiter who overheard a customer's date and decided to warn the guy about the woman's behavior. The key points here are intent, context, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the waiter's intent was to be helpful, to \"be a bro\" as mentioned. He noticed a pattern of the woman coming in with different guys and used that as a reason to warn the current date. But does that justify his action? The problem arises when someone acts as a third party in someone else's personal relationship. Even if the waiter thought he was doing the right thing, intervening in a personal situation where he wasn't asked to could be crossing a line.\n\nThen there's the context of his job. As a waiter, his role is to serve customers, not to police their personal lives. By giving unsolicited advice to a customer, he's stepping beyond his professional boundaries. The boss wrote him up because it's against his role. That suggests the workplace has policies against such actions, which the waiter violated.\n\nConsequences-wise, the date left quickly, and the woman complained. The waiter's action led to a conflict and a formal reprimand. Even if he thought he was helping, the workplace repercussions are significant. Employers usually expect employees to stay within their job roles and not interfere in customers' private matters.\n\nOn the other hand, the waiter might argue that he was trying to prevent someone from being harmed, assuming the woman was deceptive. But without knowing the full story, it's risky to assume intent. Plus, the waiter isn't in a position to validate the woman's behavior; that's up to the individuals involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together: while the intention might have been to help, the action was unprofessional and overstepped boundaries. The answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong because he acted outside his role and caused a workplace issue.\n"
