      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the waiter is in the wrong for warning a guy about his date. The situation is that the waiter noticed a girl comes in with different guys weekly and uses similar moves. When she went to the bathroom, the waiter told the guy about this, and the guy left quickly. The girl complained, leading to a write-up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The waiter's job is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal relationships. By informing the guy, the waiter might be overstepping their role. Even if the waiter had good intentions, like trying to protect someone from a possible scam, they might be violating the customer's privacy. The girl's behavior doesn't necessarily mean she's scamming people, but the waiter made an assumption. Also, the employer's rules probably require the waiter to stay neutral and not interfere. The write-up from the boss suggests that the action breached company policy. So, even if the intention was good, the action was unprofessional and could be seen as harassment or interference. Therefore, the waiter is in the wrong.\n"
