He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the waiter is in the wrong for warning a guy about his date. So the situation is that the waiter noticed a girl comes in with different guys often and told one of the guys about her pattern. The guy left, and the girl complained, leading to the waiter being written up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. The waiter's job is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal relationships. By giving the guy information that could affect his decision to stay, the waiter might be overstepping. Even if the waiter's intention was good, like trying to protect the guy, the action itself could be seen as a breach of the restaurant's policy. The establishment probably values neutrality and not taking sides between customers. Also, the girl's complaint might be about privacy or harassment, which could have legal implications. The waiter's job is to serve, not to judge or interfere. So, even if the waiter thought they were doing the right thing, the action was outside their professional role. Therefore, the waiter is likely in the wrong.\n"
