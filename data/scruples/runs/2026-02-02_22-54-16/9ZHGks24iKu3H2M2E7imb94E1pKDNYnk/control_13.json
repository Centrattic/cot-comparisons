      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is a waiter at a sports bar who warned a guy about his date, who comes in with different guys every week. The waiter told the guy she was there with others, and the guy left quickly. The girl complained, leading to a write-up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the waiter was justified. The main factors here are the waiter's role and boundaries as an employee. Waiters are there to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal interactions. Even if the waiter noticed a pattern, it's not their place to act as a judge or interfere with customers' relationships. \n\nThen there's the question of intent. The waiter tried to be a \"bro,\" which implies a well-meaning but overstepping action. But employees are typically expected to maintain professional boundaries. The key point is that the waiter didn't have a relationship with these customers, so giving such advice without being asked could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the girl complained, so the boss wrote up the employee. Employers usually have policies against staff interfering in customer interactions. Even if the waiter thought they were helping, it's a breach of professional conduct. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because as an employee, they shouldn't be giving unsolicited relationship advice. The boss's action makes sense as per workplace policies. Let me check if there's any nuance. If the girl was being harassed, maybe the waiter could report it, but in this case, it seems like just a regular customer pattern. The waiter's action might be considered unprofessional. Yeah, AITA is usually about overstepping roles. So the answer is A.\n"
