There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that a waiter warned a man about his date, who the waiter noticed was coming in with different guys often. The waiter told the date that the woman was with different people, leading him to leave, and the woman complained, resulting in a write-up.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. First, the waiter's intent was to be helpful, trying to protect the date from potential deceit. But the waiter isn't responsible for the couple's relationship. By intervening, he's crossing into their personal matters. Even if the woman is being unfaithful, the waiter doesn't have the right to meddle. The job is to serve, not to act as a moral guardian. The date might have his own judgment, and the waiter's actions could be seen as overstepping. Plus, the woman complaining led to a write-up, which affects the waiter's job. So, even if the intent was good, the action was inappropriate. The answer is probably A, but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe if the woman's behavior was illegal, but it's not stated. So, the waiter shouldn't have gotten involved. Answer A.\n"
