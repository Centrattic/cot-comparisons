There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a waiter who warned a customer's date about his date being a regular with different guys each time. The waiter got written up, and the question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and professional aspects. The waiter's intention was to protect the customer from possible deceit. However, the waiter isn't the customer's friend or responsible for their interactions. The role of a waiter is to serve, not to meddle in personal relationships.\n\nThen there's the workplace policy angle. The employer might have rules about not engaging in personal conversations with customers, as it could lead to conflicts or liability. By intervening, the waiter might have breached those policies, leading to the write-up. The employer's priority is likely to maintain a professional environment and avoid staff from taking sides or causing disturbances.\n\nBut the argument for the waiter is that he was trying to help someone avoid a bad situation. If the girl was indeed using different men, maybe she was being deceptive. However, the waiter has no way of knowing her intentions for sure. He could be misjudging her, and it's not his place to act as a judge.\n\nAlso, the woman complained, which suggests that the customer felt uncomfortable. The waiter's action led to the customer leaving, which might affect the business. The employer's response (a write-up) implies that they don't condone staff making decisions that could impact the business or customer experience.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the intention was good, the method was inappropriate. The waiter crossed a professional boundary. The right approach might have been to let the customer handle their own interactions. Unless there was clear evidence of harm, intervening isn't the staff's responsibility.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The waiter's actions, though well-meaning, likely violated workplace policies and overstepped his role. Therefore, he might be at fault.\n"
