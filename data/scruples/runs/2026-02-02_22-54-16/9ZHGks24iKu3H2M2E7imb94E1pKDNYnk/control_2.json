      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a waiter who warned a man's date that his date was there with different guys every week. The date left quickly, and the girl complained, leading to the author getting a write-up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. The waiter is an employee, and their job is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal interactions. The key point is whether the waiter overstepped his role. \n\nInterfering in customers' personal relationships isn't part of the waiter's job duties. Even if the waiter had good intentions, like trying to protect someone from a potentially manipulative situation, it's not their place to do so. The employer likely sees this as a breach of professional conduct because it could be seen as creating a hostile environment or violating customer privacy.\n\nAlso, the girl's complaint led to a write-up, which suggests that the employer has policies against such actions. The waiter's action might be considered unprofessional, regardless of the intent. However, some might argue that the waiter was trying to help someone avoid a bad situation. But in a professional setting, the responsibility lies with the employee to adhere to their job role without personal judgment.\n\nSo, even if the intention was good, the action was unprofessional. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
