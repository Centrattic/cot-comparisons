      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the waiter is in the wrong for warning a date about his date's behavior. The situation is that the waiter overheard the woman with different guys every week and felt it was his duty to inform the date, which led to the man leaving and the woman complaining, resulting in a write-up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. The waiter's primary job is to serve customers, not to meddle in their personal interactions. Even if his intentions were good, stepping into a personal relationship like that could be seen as overstepping. Employers usually expect staff to maintain professional boundaries. By intervening, the waiter might have created a hostile work environment if the customer felt targeted. Also, the woman's complaint led to a write-up, which suggests the employer views this as a breach of policy. \n\nOn the other hand, the waiter might have thought he was helping, but in a professional setting, it's generally not appropriate for staff to get involved in customers' personal matters. There could be legal issues if the waiter's actions are seen as interfering with a customer's autonomy. The key points here are professional boundaries, workplace policies, and the potential for customer dissatisfaction leading to disciplinary action. So, the answer is likely that the waiter is in the wrong because he violated his professional role and possibly company policy.\n"
