The scenario is about a waiter warning a date that his companion is there with different guys often. The waiter got written up, and the girl complained.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The waiter's job is to serve customers, not to mediate their personal relationships. By approaching the date directly, the waiter might have overstepped his role. Even if the intention was to \"help,\" it's not the waiter's place to do that. The girl's complaint makes sense because she might feel her privacy was invaded or that the waiter was being judgmental. The employer likely has policies against interfering with customers' experiences, which is why the waiter got a write-up. \n\nOn the other hand, the waiter might think he was being a good guy by protecting the date from a possible situation. But the method was inappropriate. The right approach would be to report the behavior to management, not confront the customer directly. So, the author probably is in the wrong because they acted outside their professional boundaries. Answer A.\n"
