      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong. The scenario is about a waiter who warned a guy that his date was there with different guys every week, leading the guy to leave quickly. The woman complained, and the waiter got written up.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The waiter's intention was to protect the date from a possible scammer or someone being unfaithful. But the action involved sharing personal information about a customer, which might be a privacy issue. Also, the employer wrote him up, which suggests there's a policy against interfering with customers or sharing their information.\n\nThe waiter's role is to serve, not to intervene in customers' personal affairs. Even if the waiter had good intentions, approaching a customer's date to give unsolicited advice might violate confidentiality or company policy. The woman's complaint could be about her privacy being breached, which the waiter didn't have the right to do, regardless of his intentions.\n\nSo, from a legal and ethical standpoint, the waiter overstepped. Even if the intent was good, the action was inappropriate. The employer's response indicates that the action was against workplace rules. Therefore, the waiter is likely in the wrong because he shouldn't have shared the information without consent or cause.\n"
