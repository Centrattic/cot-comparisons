There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week.

He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a waiter who warned a guy about his date, who's a regular customer bringing different guys each week. The waiter felt like they were being \"a bro\" and gave the guy a heads-up. The guy left quickly, and the girl complained, leading to a write-up.\n\nHmm, first, the key point is whether the waiter had the right to intervene. As a waiter, their job is to serve and ensure a good customer experience. But giving personal advice to a customer about their date might be crossing a line. The girl's behavior might be her own choice, even if it's questionable. The waiter's action could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's not part of their role. \n\nAlso, the guy might not have needed the warning. Maybe he had his own reasons for being with her. The waiter's intention was to protect the guy, but that's assuming he's in a position to judge the situation. Even if the waiter thought the guy was being taken advantage of, it's not their place to interfere unless there's a policy against such behavior. \n\nThe girl complained to the boss, which led to the write-up. That suggests the employer doesn't condone employees giving unsolicited advice to customers. The waiter might have violated company policy by sharing personal information about a customer. \n\nSo, while the intention might have been good, the action was probably unprofessional and against the job's boundaries. The answer is likely A (yes, the waiter is in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Maybe there's a cultural context where this is seen as helpful. However, in most professional settings, intervening like that without being asked could be problematic. Yeah, I think the waiter overstepped their role here.\n"
