      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a waiter, warned a customer about his date who's been coming in with different guys weekly. The date left quickly, and the girl complained, leading to a write-up from the boss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The waiter's intention was to warn the guy to be careful, which is a well-meaning act. However, the waiter's role is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal relationships. By sharing information about another customer's behavior, the waiter might have violated confidentiality. The bar's policies likely prohibit employees from discussing other patrons' private lives, so this could be a breach of those rules.\n\nThen there's the legal side. If the girl was a regular and her behavior is a concern, the waiter should probably report it through proper channels, like a manager, rather than directly confronting the date. The waiter's action might be seen as spreading gossip or interfering without authorization. Even if the intention was good, the method used was unprofessional and could lead to customer complaints, which the boss would address by writing up the employee.\n\nAlso, the outcome: the guy left quickly, and the girl ended up complaining. The waiter's intervention had a direct impact on the customer experience. Another perspective is that the date might have made an informed choice, but the waiter's action could be seen as taking sides or acting as a judge. In a professional setting, maintaining neutrality and not involving oneself in customers' private matters is important. The waiter's job is to serve, not to mediate or warn about others' behavior.\n\nSo, while the author might have thought they were doing a good deed (\"being a bro\"), the action was unprofessional and possibly against workplace policies. The boss's write-up is a consequence of that. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they overstepped their role and breached confidentiality.\n"
