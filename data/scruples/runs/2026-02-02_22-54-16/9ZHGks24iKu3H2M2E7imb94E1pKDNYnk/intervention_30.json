      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for warning a customer about his date. The situation is that the author is a waiter who noticed a woman coming in with different guys every week, using similar moves. When she went to the bathroom, the waiter told the guy to be careful, leading him to leave quickly. The woman complained, and the waiter got written up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the waiter's responsibility. As an employee, their main job is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal relationships. By intervening, the waiter overstepped their role. Even if they had good intentions, they crossed a line by sharing personal information about a customer without consent. The woman might feel her privacy was invaded, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe waiter's action could be seen as a breach of confidentiality. Restaurants typically don't encourage employees to meddle in customers' private lives. The boss wrote them up because they violated company policy, which likely includes not engaging in personal judgments or interfering with customers. \n\nOn the other hand, the waiter might argue they were trying to prevent someone from being taken advantage of. However, it's not their place to act as a moral guardian. They should have focused on their job rather than taking sides. The woman's complaint is justified because she had the right to privacy, and the waiter's actions could be seen as harassment or defamation if the claims were false. \n\nSo, even if the waiter meant well, they were not in the right because they overstepped their professional boundaries. The answer is A.\n"
