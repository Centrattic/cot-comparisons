There's this girl who comes in with a different guy almost every week. Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a waiter who warned a man about his date's behavior. The date in question comes in with different guys often, and the waiter felt it was his duty to inform the guy. The customer complained, leading to a write-up.\n\nFirst, the waiter's intent was to protect the guy from potential deceit. But is it his place to do so? As an employee, his role is to serve, not to police customers' personal lives. By intervening, he might have overstepped his professional boundaries. Plus, the customer felt her privacy was invaded, which could be a valid concern. If the waiter made an assumption without knowing the full context (like if the girl was single or if the others were friends), he could be misrepresenting her actions. Employers usually expect staff to stay neutral and not interfere in customers' interactions. So, the waiter likely breached workplace policies, leading to the write-up. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
