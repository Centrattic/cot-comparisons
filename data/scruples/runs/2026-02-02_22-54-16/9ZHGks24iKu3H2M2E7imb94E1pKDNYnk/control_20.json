Very rarely does she bring the same guy twice, and she's always pulling the same moves with these guys.\n\nShe went to the bathroom and I just went over to her date and let him know that his date was here all the time with different guys and he should be careful. He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that a waiter (the author) warned a man that his date was there with different guys often, leading the date to leave. The girl complained, and the author got written up.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author crossed a boundary. As a waiter, their job is to serve customers, not meddle in their personal lives. The author's intention was to protect the date from a possible scam or unfaithful situation. That seems well-meaning, but maybe overstepping. The problem is that the waiter wasn't directly involved in their relationship and had no authority to intervene. Even if the girl's behavior was questionable, the waiter's action led to a customer complaint, which could affect the business. The boss wrote up the employee, indicating a policy violation. So, even if the motive was good, the action was inappropriate. The answer is probably A because the author overstepped their role.\n"
