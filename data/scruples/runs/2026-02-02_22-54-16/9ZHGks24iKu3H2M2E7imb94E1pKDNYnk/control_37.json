He left pretty quickly after that. The girl apparently complained about it, because my boss wrote me up.\n\nAITA for trying to be a bro?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the waiter is in the wrong for warning a guy about his date who comes with different guys weekly. The waiter got written up by his boss after the girl complained.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The waiter's intention was to be helpful, right? He saw a pattern where the girl was with different guys and thought he was protecting the date. But is it his place to intervene like that?\n\nEmployment-wise, as a waiter, maybe his job is to serve, not to meddle in customers' personal lives. If a customer complained about him interfering, the boss might have to address that. The waiter could be out of his role, leading to disciplinary action.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Even if the waiter was trying to be a \"good guy,\" he's making an assumption about the girl's behavior. Maybe there's a different reason she's with different guys\u2014like friends, family, or something else. He's not in a position to judge or act as a moral authority.\n\nAlso, the girl's right to privacy. By informing the date, he's potentially exposing her to scrutiny without her consent. That could be a breach of trust or privacy. Even if his intentions were good, it's possible he overstepped.\n\nBut then again, the waiter might think he was doing the right thing by preventing someone from being hurt. However, he didn't know the full story. Maybe the girl is in a situation where she's being taken advantage of, but that's not his place to decide. He should probably let the customers handle their own interactions.\n\nSo, legally and ethically, the waiter might be in the wrong because he's interfering beyond his role. His job isn't to mediate or warn about customers' personal lives. The employer's decision to write him up could be justified based on workplace policy and maintaining professional boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
