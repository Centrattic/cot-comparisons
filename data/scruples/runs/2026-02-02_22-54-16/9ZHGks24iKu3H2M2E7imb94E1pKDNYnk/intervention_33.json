      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a waiter who noticed a regular customer bringing different guys every week and using the same moves. When one of her dates came in, the waiter went over to him during a bathroom break and warned him that his date was there often with different guys. The guy left quickly, and the woman complained, leading to the waiter getting written up.\n\nSo the question is whether the waiter was in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate it. \n\nFirst, the waiter's intention was to warn the date about possible infidelity or deceit. But as a waiter, their role is to serve, not to meddle in customers' personal lives. The waiter crossed a boundary by intervening in a personal interaction between customers. Even if the intention was good, it's not their place to do so. \n\nAlso, the woman complained, and the boss took action, which suggests that the restaurant policy or the situation was violated. Employers typically expect employees to maintain professionalism and not get involved in patrons' private matters. \n\nEven if the waiter believed the woman was being deceptive, the appropriate action might be to inform the management if there's a policy against harassment or something similar, not to approach the date directly. The waiter's action could be seen as harassment or interfering in a customer's experience, which is unprofessional. \n\nSo while the intention might be seen as trying to help, the action itself overstepped professional boundaries. Therefore, the waiter is in the wrong.\n"
