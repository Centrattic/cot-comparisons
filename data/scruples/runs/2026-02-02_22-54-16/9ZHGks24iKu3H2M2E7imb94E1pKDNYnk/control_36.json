      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about a waiter warning a customer's date about the customer being with different guys regularly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The waiter's role is to serve customers, not to interfere in their personal relationships. The main issue here is that the waiter crossed a boundary by sharing information that isn't his to share. Even if the intention was to be helpful or a \"bro,\" the action led to the customer complaining and the waiter getting written up. \n\nEmployers typically expect employees to maintain professionalism and not interfere in customers' private matters. The waiter's action could be seen as a breach of confidentiality or overstepping job responsibilities. While the waiter might have good intentions, the method of addressing the situation was inappropriate. The customer (the girl) felt her privacy was invaded, leading to the complaint. \n\nSo, even though the waiter didn't mean harm, the action violated professional boundaries. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
