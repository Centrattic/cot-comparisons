Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong for getting two women at their office fired.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated startup. He's a top performer in sales, earning high commissions. Colleagues, mostly women, have been sending him hurtful messages about his appearance and implying he's successful because he's a man. After a big commission, the author confronts the CEO with screenshots of these messages, leading to the firing of two women and others being written up. Now, he's feeling guilty and the office is hostile towards him. His friend called his actions \"dickish\" and suggested he should have confronted them directly instead of going to the CEO. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nTo analyze this, I should consider the facts and possible angles. The key issues here are workplace bullying, the appropriateness of the author's response, and whether the consequences were justified.\n\nWorkplace bullying is a serious issue. The messages the author received\u2014mocking his height, appearance, and implying sexism\u2014could be considered harassment or a hostile work environment. The author's friend, the office manager, showed him these messages, which he then presented to the CEO. The CEO took action, firing two women and addressing the environment.\n\nThe author's actions: He gathered evidence and reported it to the CEO. Is this the right approach? Usually, addressing issues through proper channels is advisable. The problem is whether the messages constituted actionable misconduct. The CEO determined that it was workplace bullying and took steps. However, the author's friend argues he should have confronted them directly first. That's a valid point. Confronting the individuals might have been a more direct approach before escalating to HR or the CEO. However, if the messages were via private channels and the office manager was already involved, maybe the author was following the correct protocol.\n\nAnother angle is the CEO's decision to fire two of the women. The author wanted to fire the most cruel one, but the CEO fired two. Was the punishment too harsh? The messages, even if between colleagues, could be considered unprofessional and hostile. However, getting fired might be an extreme response, especially if the messages were not part of their job responsibilities but rather personal attacks. The CEO might have overreacted, but the author's role was to report the behavior.\n\nThe author's guilt: He might feel responsible because he caused the firings, but if the workplace was indeed toxic, his action was necessary. The friend's opinion that it was \"childish\" might be underestimating the severity of the harassment. The messages were hurtful and targeted the author's appearance and gender, which touches on discrimination issues.\n\nAlso, the fact that the office is female-dominated and the author is male could add a layer of gender dynamics. The female colleagues might have felt outnumbered or that the author was being favored, but that doesn't justify harassment. The CEO's email about contacting an HR consultant suggests that the company is trying to address the broader issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the author reported a hostile work environment, which he had a right to do. The CEO's actions were within their authority, but the author might have considered internal resolution first. However, given the nature of the messages and the support from the office manager, his approach was reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
