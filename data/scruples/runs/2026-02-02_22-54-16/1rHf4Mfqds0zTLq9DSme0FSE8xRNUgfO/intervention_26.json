Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting two women fired at work because of harassment. The situation details that the author, a male sales rep, was making a lot of money in commissions, which led to some female colleagues making hurtful comments about his appearance and implying he got preferential treatment. The author eventually showed these messages to the CEO, leading to the firing of two women and a warning to others. Now, the author feels bad and is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions taken. The key points here are workplace harassment and the appropriate response. Harassment based on gender, especially if it's creating a toxic environment, is a serious issue. The comments the author received were not just light-hearted teasing but included personal attacks and possibly sexist remarks. For example, comments about his height and implying he has a small penis, as well as suggesting that his success is due to being a man rather than performance, which touches on gender bias.\n\nThe author's response was to go to the CEO with evidence (screenshots) of the harassment. The CEO then took action by firing two individuals and issuing warnings to others. The author is now feeling guilty, perhaps because he's aware of the consequences for the employees involved, but also because he might be questioning if his approach was the best.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, if the comments constituted harassment, then the author had a right to report them. Workplace harassment policies typically require that employees report such behavior. The author did not confront the individuals directly first, which his friend suggested he should have done. However, in some cases, especially if the harassment is ongoing and the employee feels uncomfortable addressing it directly, reporting to higher-ups is a valid step.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's argument is that the author could have handled it differently, like confronting the women first. Also, the friend mentioned that the comments might have been \"joking,\" which could imply they weren't as severe. However, if the comments were indeed hostile or created a hostile work environment, then they cross the line from joking to harassment. The key here is whether the comments were within acceptable workplace behavior or not.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for gender bias in the workplace. The author is a male in a female-dominated environment, and the harassment might be linked to gender dynamics. The friend also suggested that the higher commissions might be due to sexism, which adds another layer of complexity. However, the author's commissions are based on performance, so if the women are implying that his success is due to his gender rather than his work, that's a form of sexism.\n\nThe CEO's response seems appropriate given the evidence provided. Firing employees for creating a toxic work environment and engaging in harassment is a standard disciplinary action. However, the author might have felt that the punishment was too harsh, especially if the comments were not maliciously intended. But if the evidence clearly showed a pattern of harassment, then the CEO's actions are justified.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, if he felt that the harassment was affecting his work and well-being, he had a right to report it. The friend's suggestion to confront them directly is a common advice, but sometimes that's not sufficient if the behavior persists or is part of a larger pattern. The author's actions might be seen as taking the correct step to address a serious issue that he couldn't resolve on his own.\n\nHowever, there's a possibility that the author could have tried to mediate the situation first, but given the hostile nature of the comments, that might not be effective. The key is whether the actions taken were in line with company policy and the severity of the harassment. If the company has clear policies against harassment and the author followed the proper reporting channels, then he's not in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author could have considered a different approach, such as direct confrontation, his decision to report the harassment to the CEO with evidence was a valid response to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
