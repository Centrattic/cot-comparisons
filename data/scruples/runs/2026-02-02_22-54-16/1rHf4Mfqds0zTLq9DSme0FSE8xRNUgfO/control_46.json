Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a young man in a mostly female workplace. He's doing well in sales, making a lot of money through commissions. The other female employees start making hurtful comments about him, including sexist remarks and mockery about his appearance. He ignores it at first, but when it escalates after a big commission, he brings it to the CEO's attention with evidence, leading to two women being fired and others written up. Now he's feeling guilty and the office is against him. His friend tells him it was a dickish move and that he should have addressed it directly, not went to the CEO. The question is, is he in the wrong?\n\nI need to consider workplace policies and appropriate responses to harassment. The author has a right to a safe work environment. If there's bullying or harassment, reporting it is a valid step. However, the method and evidence matter. He collected screenshots showing the negative comments, which is good. The CEO then took action based on that. But some might argue that the author could have tried to resolve it internally first, like talking to the HR or the individuals involved. However, since the comments were already being reported to HR by the office manager, maybe the author was within his rights to escalate.\n\nAnother angle: the friend's advice that he should have confronted them directly. But if the comments were creating a hostile work environment, direct confrontation might not be effective, especially if the individuals are in positions like HR and CTO. It's possible that the author felt he couldn't handle it alone due to the power dynamics.\n\nAlso, the friend's comment about sexism\u2014if the women are making claims that he's successful because he's male, which could imply a sexist environment. The author might be facing both harassment and gender-based bias, which is a serious issue.\n\nHowever, firing people over workplace comments, even if they're offensive, can be controversial. The line between joking and harassment can be blurry. The CEO's decision to fire two women might be too harsh if the messages were considered offhand or not part of a sustained campaign. On the other hand, if the comments were documented and part of a pattern, it might be a legitimate response.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, he did report the issue to the CEO via the correct channels. He didn't take matters into his own hands beyond gathering evidence. The CEO made the decision to fire, so the author isn't directly responsible for the firings. But he did initiate the process, so there could be some shared responsibility depending on the company's policies.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's a tough call. Reporting harassment is generally the right thing to do. However, the method and the resulting firings might be overreactions. The friend's point about confronting them first could be valid in some contexts, but given the severity of the comments, reporting to higher-ups might be necessary. The author might be in a position where he's not in the wrong, but the situation shows that handling workplace dynamics is tricky. The key is whether the author acted within the company's policies and if the CEO's actions were appropriate. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether reporting the harassment was justified. Since harassment is not acceptable, the author likely isn't in the wrong for reporting it. However, the way he handled it (going straight to the CEO with evidence) might be seen as overstepping, but in the context of workplace harassment, it's often encouraged to report such issues. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), but I need to be sure.\n"
