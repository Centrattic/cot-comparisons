Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author reporting two female coworkers for bullying, which led to their termination. The author is conflicted because he feels bad about them losing their jobs, especially since they were part of a female-dominated workplace and he's a minority there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author faced workplace bullying\u2014nasty comments about his appearance and even insinuations that his success was due to being male. These comments were ongoing and eventually led him to take action after a significant commission. He showed evidence to the CEO, who then fired two women and reprimanded others. The author is now feeling guilty and is questioning his actions.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, workplace bullying is a serious issue. The author documented the harassment and reported it, which is the correct procedure. However, the outcome was the termination of two employees, which is a major consequence. The office manager friend suggested he should have confronted them directly, which is a valid point. Confronting the issue directly might have resolved it without job loss. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the bullying was creating a hostile work environment, the author had the right to seek intervention. The key points are whether the author acted in good faith and followed proper channels. The CEO did take action, which indicates that the situation was indeed inappropriate. The author's actions were a response to a toxic environment, not just jealousy over commissions. The fact that the comments included sexist remarks and personal attacks adds weight to the issue.\n\nThe friend's perspective that it might be sexist to pay him more could be a red herring. Commissions are based on performance, so if he earned more through his work, that's justified. The coworkers' resentment might be based on gender bias. The author's decision to escalate the issue was necessary to address the harassment, even though it had consequences. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting bullying. The problem lies in the coworkers' behavior and the company's response. The author followed the right steps, even if the outcome was harsh. The answer should be B (No), but there's nuance in the friend's advice about direct confrontation. However, the core issue of harassment is more severe than the means of resolution. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
