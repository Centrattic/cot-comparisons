Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting two women at their office fired. The story is pretty long, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old part-time sales rep turned full-time Account Executive in a female-dominated startup. He's doing well, making a lot of commissions, which seems to be based on performance. The problem arises when some female coworkers start making hurtful comments about him, related to his appearance and implying sexism. He ignores it initially but when it escalates after a big commission, he brings the evidence to the CEO, leading to two being fired and others written up. Now he's questioning if he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted on bullying/harassment, used evidence to report it, and the consequences were job losses. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, workplace bullying and harassment are serious issues. If the comments were indeed derogatory, made based on gender, and created a hostile environment, then the company is obligated to address it. The author didn't confront them directly as suggested by his friend, but he did go to HR/CEO with documentation. The CEO then took action, which is standard procedure.\n\nHowever, the author's friend argues that the author should have confronted them first. But in many workplaces, especially where there's a power imbalance or repeated harassment, employees are within their rights to report directly. The friend also mentions that the comments might have been joking, but the screenshots show they were hurtful and not just banter. \n\nAnother angle is the potential sexism angle. The coworkers are suggesting he made more money because he's a guy, which is a serious accusation. If that's true, it's discrimination, but the author's argument is that commissions are performance-based. The situation is complicated by the fact that the workplace is mostly female, but the author is a male in a minority position. However, the problem here is the behavior of the coworkers, not the gender composition.\n\nThe author's actions lead to firings, which he feels bad about, but if the behavior was indeed toxic and abusive, then the company's response is appropriate. The question remains if he's in the wrong for reporting it. Legally and ethically, reporting harassment is the right thing to do. However, some might argue he didn't give them a chance to resolve it internally first. But given that the harassment was ongoing and documented, his actions were justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). He reported workplace bullying and harassment, which is the correct procedure. The consequences were handled by the company, and while he feels guilty, his actions were appropriate given the evidence and the hostile environment.\n"
