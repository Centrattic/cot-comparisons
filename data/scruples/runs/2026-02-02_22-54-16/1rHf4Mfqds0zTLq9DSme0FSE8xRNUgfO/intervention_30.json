Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old guy, got two women fired from his office because of bullying and catty comments they made towards him. The other employees were sending messages making fun of his height, appearance, and implying sexism about his higher commissions. He showed the CEO the screenshots, leading to the firings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was being bullied with personal attacks and sexist remarks. He reported it to the CEO, who took action. The friend he talked to thinks it's dickish and that he should have confronted them first. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nWorkplace bullying is a serious issue. If the comments were indeed creating a hostile environment, the CEO was right to address it. However, the question is about the author's actions. Did he overreact by going straight to the CEO with screenshots, leading to firings? In many workplaces, reporting harassment is the correct step. However, the author's friend suggests he should have tried to resolve it directly first. But given the nature of the comments\u2014sexist, personal, and creating a toxic environment\u2014reporting them could be justified.\n\nThe other consideration is whether the women's actions warranted termination. If the comments were part of a pattern of bullying and created a hostile work environment, then firing them might be appropriate. But if they were just \"joking\" or being catty without crossing into harassment, that's a different story. The author provided screenshots of the messages, which he claims were hurtful and not just jokes. The CEO called it workplace bullying, so there's some validation there.\n\nAnother angle: the author is male in a female-dominated workplace, and there might be underlying sexism at play. The women's comments about him making more due to his gender could be the real issue here. The author's actions might have been necessary to address both bullying and potential gender discrimination.\n\nHowever, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The main factors are: did he take the right steps to address the harassment? In most cases, reporting to HR or a superior is the correct course of action. The friend's advice that he should have confronted them first is a common suggestion, but if the harassment is ongoing and not resolved through direct confrontation, reporting is appropriate. The author did try to brush it off but eventually couldn't take it anymore. The CEO's response was to fire two and write up others, which might be the right action given the severity.\n\nAlso, the author feels bad about causing others to lose their jobs, which indicates he's thoughtful about the consequences. But the question is about right or wrong. If the workplace environment was truly toxic and the comments were harassment, then he's justified. If the comments were just cattiness without harassment, maybe not. But the line between cattiness and harassment can be blurry. The key is whether the behavior was inappropriate and created a hostile work environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author took a stand against harassment, reported it, and the company took action. While the friend's perspective is valid, the author's actions might be justified. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
