Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by getting two women at his office fired because of bullying and sexist comments.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a young man at a female-dominated startup. He's doing well in sales, making significant commissions. The other women in the office started making derogatory comments about him, including sexist remarks and mocking his appearance. He tried to ignore it, but after a big commission check, he presented evidence of the bullying to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others reprimanded. Now he feels bad and is questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: workplace bullying, handling of the situation, and whether the author's actions were justified. The key factors here are the nature of the comments, the appropriate response to bullying, and the consequences of the author's actions.\n\nWorkplace bullying is a serious issue, and there's a responsibility to address it. The author documented the harassment and reported it to the CEO, which is a standard procedure. However, the way he handled it might be in question. He didn't confront the individuals directly first, as his friend suggested. Instead, he went straight to the CEO with evidence. Some might argue that he followed the right protocol by reporting to management, especially if the company has policies against harassment. However, others might think he should have tried to resolve it internally first.\n\nAnother angle is the potential sexism mentioned. The women claimed the author was making more because he's a man, which could point to underlying gender issues. The author's friend suggested that it's actually sexist that he's making more, which might indicate a problem with the company's pay structure. However, the author states that commissions are performance-based, so if he's earning more due to better performance, it's legitimate. The women's comments might be sexist, but the author's actions in response could be seen as heavy-handed if the CEO didn't fire all involved, leading to the author feeling like a pariah.\n\nThe author's friend thinks it's childish to get them fired over jokes, but the screenshots showed really hurtful comments. The line between joking and harassment is thin. If the comments were clearly abusive and targeted, then the response might be justified. However, if they were just teasing, firing employees could be excessive. The CEO's decision to fire two and write up others suggests that the behavior was serious enough, but the author might have felt it necessary to escalate quickly.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. He wanted to stop the bullying and protect his work environment. However, the result is that he now feels isolated and responsible for others losing their jobs. The ethical question is whether the end justified the means. Did he have a duty to report the harassment, or should he have handled it differently?\n\nIn many workplaces, reporting harassment to management is the correct step, so the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the comments were not severe enough to warrant termination, then maybe his actions were excessive. The complexity here is balancing the seriousness of the harassment against the consequences for the employees involved.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer depends on whether the author's actions were proportionate to the offense and whether he followed proper procedures. Since he documented the harassment and reported it, which is the right thing to do, he might not be in the wrong. However, if the CEO's response was too harsh or if the author didn't give the women a chance to address the issue themselves, then maybe he is. The friend's suggestion to confront them directly first is a valid point, so that could mean the author is in the wrong for not trying that approach first. But if confronting them would have made the harassment worse, then reporting might have been necessary.\n\nI think the key here is that the author reported harassment that was documented, which is a responsible action. However, the outcome made him feel like a pariah, which might indicate that the company's culture has issues beyond just the harassment. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because he took appropriate steps to address a hostile work environment. However, there's a counterargument that he could have handled it more diplomatically. Given the details provided, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the harassment was real and he reported it through proper channels.\n"
