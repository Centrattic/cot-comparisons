Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is at fault for getting two women fired at their office. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old male in a female-dominated startup, is making high commissions. The other female employees have been making hurtful comments about his appearance and implying he was given better leads because he's a guy. The author then took screenshots of these messages and showed them to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others written up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is in a workplace where he's experiencing bullying and harassment. The comments are about his appearance and include sexist remarks. Legally, workplace harassment is a big deal, especially if it's based on gender. The author reported the issue to the CEO, which is the proper channel. But the friend suggested he should have confronted them directly instead of going to management, which is a common advice in conflict resolution. However, if the harassment is severe and ongoing, reporting it might be the right move. \n\nThere's a possible issue here with the CEO's response. If the comments were indeed based on the author's gender, then it could be considered a hostile work environment, which is against the law. The CEO might have a responsibility to address this. But the question is about the author's actions. Did he overreact? The friend thinks it's \"dickish\" to go to the boss instead of confronting them. However, the author might not have felt comfortable confronting them directly, especially if he felt isolated or if previous attempts didn't work. \n\nOn the other hand, getting people fired is a significant action. The author might have felt justified, but the consequences are severe. Maybe he didn't give the women a chance to apologize or correct their behavior. Also, the friend mentioned that the comments were \"childish\" and maybe were just joking. But if the author felt it was harassment, he's within his rights to report it. \n\nAnother angle: the company's culture. If it's a startup with mostly young employees, maybe there's a toxic environment where such behavior is more common. However, that doesn't excuse harassment. The CEO's decision to act shows that the company doesn't condone it. \n\nI think the author's main issue is handling the situation. He reported the harassment, which is the correct step, but maybe he should have followed up with a direct confrontation first. However, in many cases, direct confrontation isn't the best approach if the bullying is systemic or if the person feels unsafe. The author might not be in the wrong because the responsibility for a hostile work environment lies with the company to address. But depending on the context, if the comments were taken out of context or exaggerated, it could be a problem. The friend's perspective is that it's wrong, but the CEO's action suggests that the company supports the author's report. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's report was justified and if he followed proper procedures. Since he did go to the CEO, which is the right channel for HR issues, and the CEO took appropriate action, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the comments were considered \"joking\" and not actual harassment, there might be a debate. But given that the comments included sexist and personal attacks, the author's actions seem reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
