Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about getting two women fired for workplace bullying after he brought it to the CEO's attention. The main question is whether he acted appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author is a 22-year-old sales rep who's been doing well, earning high commissions. He mentions that female coworkers started sending mean messages about his appearance and making comments about his success being due to being a male. He tried to brush it off, but when the behavior escalated, he showed the CEO the evidence, leading to two women being fired and others written up.\n\nNow, let's consider the key points. Workplace bullying is a serious issue. If the messages were actually bullying or harassment, then the author did the right thing by reporting it. However, there's a nuance here. The author's friend, the office manager, showed him the messages. He didn't confront them directly but went straight to the CEO. Some might argue he should have addressed the issue first with the individuals involved. But if the behavior was persistent and toxic, maybe direct confrontation wouldn't have worked, especially if it's a group.\n\nAnother angle is the potential sexism angle. The author's friend mentioned that the women might feel he's getting more because he's a guy, even though commissions are performance-based. That raises questions about whether the workplace culture has deeper issues. The author might have felt targeted because of his gender, but that doesn't make the bullying okay. However, if the women's comments were just \"jokes,\" then firing them could be seen as overreacting. However, the messages showed up as actually hurtful, not just teasing.\n\nAlso, the author's method of handling it\u2014showing the CEO screenshots and leading to immediate firings\u2014could be seen as harsh. The office manager's friend suggested he should have confronted them directly. But if the CEO was aware of the performance-based structure and the bullying was creating a toxic environment, then the CEO's actions might have been appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel guilty for firing people, even if they were wrong. The question is whether his actions were justified. If the behavior was indeed harassment or bullying, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the comments were just workplace banter taken too far, then maybe he overstepped. But the messages described (mocking his height, appearance, and implying he got more because of his gender) could be considered inappropriate and unprofessional.\n\nIn conclusion, the author reported a toxic work environment, which is a valid concern. The decision to involve the CEO might have been the only way to address it, especially if direct confrontation wasn't effective. While the method might have been heavy-handed, the intent was to stop bullying. So, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong), but there are arguments both ways. The key is whether the behavior was actual harassment or just office gossip.\n"
