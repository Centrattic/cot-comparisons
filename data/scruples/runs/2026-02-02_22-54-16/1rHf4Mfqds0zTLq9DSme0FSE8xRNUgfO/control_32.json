Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that a 22-year-old male sales rep at a female-dominated startup company made a lot of money in commissions. The women in the office started sending him mean messages about his appearance and making sexist comments. He gathered evidence and showed it to the CEO, leading to two women being fired. Now he feels bad because he's the office pariah and his friend thinks he was too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The key points here are workplace bullying and how he handled it. The messages he received were indeed hurtful and included personal attacks and sexism. That's not okay, regardless of gender. However, the way he addressed the issue might be questionable.\n\nHe says he went straight to the CEO with the evidence, which is a common approach, but his friend suggested confronting them first. That's a valid point. Sometimes, addressing the issue directly with the people involved can resolve the problem without escalation. However, if the messages were serious enough to be considered harassment or bullying, then reporting to HR or a higher-up is the correct step. The company did confirm it was workplace bullying and took action.\n\nBut firing two employees based on the evidence he provided\u2014was that justified? The messages were mean, but were they severe enough to warrant termination? Workplace policies vary, but if there's a history of such behavior and it creates a hostile environment, firing might be appropriate. However, if the company had prior warnings or policies in place, maybe. The CEO might have followed the necessary procedures.\n\nThe author also mentions that the women were probably joking, according to his friend. That's a potential issue. If the comments were taken as jokes by others, maybe the author overreacted. But if the messages were clearly malicious and targeted, then it's not just a joke. The line between teasing and bullying can be blurry, but the author's friend (the office manager) showed him the messages, implying that they were indeed inappropriate.\n\nAnother point is the gender dynamics. The author is the only male in a female-dominated office, and there's a suggestion of sexism. The women might have felt he was getting preferential treatment because he's a man, even if the performance is the main factor. That could contribute to the tension. However, the author's actions were to report the bullying, which is the right thing to do regardless of gender.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's method of handling the situation was the right approach. If he had tried to address it directly with the women first, that might have been better. But if the situation was escalating and the environment became toxic, escalating to the CEO makes sense. The outcome was that two women lost their jobs, and the author feels responsible. The friend's criticism that he should have confronted them first is a valid perspective, but it's also understandable that he wanted to stop the harassment quickly.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author wasn't in the wrong for reporting bullying. The company took action, which is appropriate. However, maybe he could have handled it a different way first. But the core issue is the bullying, which he was right to address. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the question is straightforward: AITA? The answer depends on whether the actions were justified. Given the context, I think the author did the right thing by reporting harassment, so B.\n"
