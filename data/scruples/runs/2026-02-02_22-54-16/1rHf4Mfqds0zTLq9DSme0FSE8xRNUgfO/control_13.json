Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves the author, a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated tech startup. He's a sales rep making significant commissions, and some female colleagues started making derogatory comments about him, including sexist and personal remarks. He showed these messages to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others written up. The author is now feeling guilty and is being called out by his friend for being a \"dick.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The key points are the workplace bullying and the response. The comments were clearly inappropriate and unprofessional, which could be considered harassment or bullying. The author's response was to report it to the CEO, leading to firings. The question is whether this was justified or if he should have handled it differently.\n\nThe author's friend argues he should have confronted them directly first. But in a professional setting, dealing with harassment can be tricky. If the environment is toxic and affecting the author's work, reporting it is a standard procedure. However, the comments might not have reached the level of legally actionable harassment, depending on the jurisdiction. The author's friend also mentions that the comments were \"childish\" and that others were probably joking, but the author provided screenshots of hurtful remarks. The line between joking and harassment can be thin, especially if it's creating a hostile work environment.\n\nAnother angle is the potential sexism angle. The colleague's friend suggests that the author might have been making more money because he's a man, implying that the company's commission structure might be biased. However, the author states that commissions are performance-based, and he earned them through his work. If the company's policies are indeed based on performance and not gender, then the higher commissions are justified. However, if there's systemic bias in lead distribution or other factors, that's a different issue, but the author doesn't mention that.\n\nThe CEO's response to fire two employees for creating a toxic environment suggests that the behavior was serious enough to warrant termination. If the messages were as described, that's a clear case of workplace bullying. The author bringing this to the CEO's attention to address the issue is a responsible action. However, the author might have escalated it without first trying to resolve it internally, which his friend pointed out. But if the situation was affecting his work and the CEO was already aware of the author's success, perhaps the author had a right to report the harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped by collecting evidence and directly showing it to the CEO without giving the colleagues a chance to correct their behavior. Confronting them first could have been a better approach. However, if the comments were persistent and creating a hostile environment, reporting is a valid step. The line between professional conduct and overreaction is delicate here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in a gray area. The colleagues' behavior was unprofessional and potentially harassing, but the author's method of dealing with it could be seen as excessive if the comments were more playful and not overtly malicious. However, given the screenshots and the CEO's response, it's possible the author was justified in seeking HR intervention. The answer might depend on the cultural context of the workplace and how serious the comments were.\n"
