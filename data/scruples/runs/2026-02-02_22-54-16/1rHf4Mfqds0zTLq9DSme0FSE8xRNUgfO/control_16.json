Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for getting two women fired at the office. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old guy in a female-dominated office. He's a top performer, making a lot in commissions. The women around him started making hurtful comments about him, including sexist remarks and personal jabs. He tried to ignore it but eventually showed the evidence to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others written up. Now he's feeling like a pariah and questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about workplace harassment and the appropriate response. The comments the author received\u2014mocking his appearance, implying he's only successful because he's a man\u2014could be considered a hostile work environment. There's a legal aspect here, as such behavior is not acceptable. However, the author's method of dealing with it might be questionable. \n\nHe didn't confront the individuals directly first; he went straight to the CEO with evidence. His friend suggested he should have addressed it more directly. On the other hand, the author might not have felt safe or comfortable confronting them directly, especially if the environment was already toxic. Also, the comments crossed into personal and possibly discriminatory territory, which the company has a responsibility to address.\n\nBut then, getting two people fired might be seen as harsh, especially if the intention was to create a joke or if the company's HR policies don't consider such comments as severe as they should be. The author's friend thinks it's childish and that the women might have been joking. However, the comments in the messages were clearly hurtful and targeted the author based on his gender and personal traits, which could be considered bullying.\n\nThe CEO did take action, which is good, but maybe the author could have handled it differently. But if the environment was persistently toxic and the author felt it was affecting his work, then reporting it is a valid step. The question is whether the author overstepped by collecting evidence and presenting it to the CEO. In some cases, this is the correct procedure, but in others, it might be seen as not giving the other employees a chance to correct their behavior.\n\nAlso, the author's friend mentioned sexism, pointing out that he's making more money than the women, which might be a factor. However, the commissions are performance-based, so if he's earning more because he's performing better, that's legitimate. The women's comments about his gender might be the real issue here, suggesting that they believe he shouldn't be successful as a man in a female-dominated field.\n\nIn terms of corporate policy, the CEO's response is appropriate, but the author's decision to escalate it directly without first trying to resolve it informally could be seen as a misstep. However, given the repeated and harmful nature of the comments, it's possible that a direct confrontation wouldn't have worked, and reporting was the right course of action.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he reported a hostile environment, which is his right. On the other hand, maybe he didn't give the women a chance to address their behavior before escalating. The answer might depend on company policies and whether the author followed proper procedures. Since the CEO agreed the behavior was unacceptable and took action, it's possible the author did the right thing. However, the method of handling it could be debated. The author's friend's perspective is that it's \"dickish,\" but if the workplace was truly toxic and the author felt targeted, then it's a valid concern. The key factors are whether the comments were indeed harassment, and whether the author's approach was in line with company protocols. Given that the CEO supported the action, it's possible the author is not in the wrong. However, the outcome of firing two people based on messages might be seen as harsh, but if the messages were as bad as described, it's a justified action. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here.\n"
