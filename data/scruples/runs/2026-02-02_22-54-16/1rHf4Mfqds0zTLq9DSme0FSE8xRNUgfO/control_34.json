Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated office, started getting high commissions and faced some bullying from his female colleagues. He eventually showed the CEO the messages they sent, leading to two women being fired. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author says that the women were making fun of him for his height, implying about his appearance, and making sexist comments about him earning more because he's a man. The author took screenshots and reported it to the CEO, resulting in firings. The CEO called it workplace bullying, but the author feels bad because he didn't confront them first and now the office is hostile towards him.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the appropriate response to workplace bullying. The author's friend suggested that he should have confronted the women first instead of going straight to the CEO. There's also a mention of possible sexism in the workplace, as the women believed he was getting better leads because he's a man. However, the commission is supposed to be performance-based, so that's a point to consider.\n\nThe author's actions led to two people losing their jobs. The question is whether that's the right approach. In many workplaces, reporting harassment or bullying is the correct step, especially if it's creating a toxic environment. However, the method matters. If the author could have addressed it internally before escalating, maybe that would have been better. But if he felt that the bullying was ongoing and not addressed otherwise, going to the CEO might be necessary.\n\nAlso, the content of the messages\u2014making fun of his appearance and spreading sexist remarks\u2014is unprofessional and could be considered harassment. The CEO did take action, which suggests that what the women did was against company policy. However, firing two people might be a heavy-handed response unless there were clear policies violated. The author's friend argues that the comments were \"childish\" and maybe not serious enough for termination, but the impact on the author's well-being is significant.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for bias. The author is the only male in a female-dominated workplace, and the women's resentment might be partly due to gender dynamics. If the commission structure is truly performance-based, then the author's success shouldn't be attributed to his gender, but the women's belief in that could be sexist. However, the author's decision to report them might have been influenced by his own feelings of being targeted because of his gender.\n\nIn terms of workplace procedures, employees are usually expected to report harassment. The author did that, and the CEO acted. But the problem arises if the author didn't exhaust other avenues first, like talking to the individuals or HR. Since the author went directly to the CEO with evidence, it might be seen as bypassing steps, which could be why his friend thinks he's being a jerk. However, if the bullying was ongoing and he felt unsafe or uncomfortable, reporting immediately could be justified.\n\nThe key factors here are:\n1. Were the women's actions indeed harassment or just personal conflicts?\n2. Did the author follow the proper reporting procedures?\n3. Was the CEO's response (firing two employees) appropriate?\n\nIf the messages were genuinely harassing and created a hostile work environment, then the author is in the right for reporting. However, if he escalated too quickly without trying to resolve it directly with the individuals, that might be seen as his fault. The answer likely depends on company policies and the severity of the harassment.\n\nIn many cases, companies expect employees to address issues directly before involving higher-ups, unless there's a reason to believe it's unsafe. The author's friend's advice to confront them first is standard, but the author felt the harassment was ongoing and harmful. The outcome of losing his social standing but not being in the wrong legally or ethically depends on the specifics of the workplace policies and the nature of the harassment.\n\nSince the CEO took action, and the company is bringing in an HR consultant, it suggests that the situation was taken seriously. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting the harassment. However, the method of reporting without trying to resolve it internally first could be seen as a misstep. But given the context, the author's actions were to protect himself from a toxic environment, which is a valid concern.\n"
