Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting two women at their office fired. The situation is pretty detailed. The author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated startup as a sales rep. He started part-time and then went full-time. He's been successful in sales, earning high commissions, which seems to have caused some tension with some of the female colleagues. They started sending him hurtful messages, making fun of his appearance and suggesting he got the money because he's a guy. The author ignored it initially, but after a big commission check, he confronted the CEO with the messages, leading to two women being fired and others being written up. Now he's feeling guilty and is asking if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Workplace bullying is a serious issue. The author has evidence of harassment from colleagues, which he presented to the CEO. The CEO took action, but the author is now being shunned and feeling guilty. The friend advised him to confront the colleagues directly, but he went to the CEO instead. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a position where he experienced harassment and took it to higher management. Reporting workplace bullying is generally the correct approach. However, the method he used\u2014collecting the messages and going directly to the CEO without confronting the colleagues first\u2014might be seen as bypassing direct communication. The friend's advice to confront them first is about trying to resolve the issue internally before escalating, which is often a recommended step.\n\nBut the content of the messages seems pretty serious. Comments about his appearance, implying he's being paid more because of his gender, and making personal, demeaning remarks. If these are true and documented, then it's a case of workplace harassment, which should be addressed by HR or upper management. The CEO did take action, which shows that the behavior was indeed inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for a toxic work environment. The CEO mentioned firing two women and writing up others, which indicates that the behavior was severe enough to warrant disciplinary action. However, the author's friend argues that the comments were \"childish\" and maybe just joking. But the author provided screenshots, so the evidence is there. If those messages are indeed as described, they cross into harassment and bullying.\n\nThe author's guilt might stem from the fact that two people lost their jobs, but if their actions were truly harmful and part of a toxic environment, then the company's response was appropriate. However, the author's approach of going directly to the CEO without trying to address it with the colleagues first could be seen as a misstep. The friend's advice about confronting them directly is about exhausting other options before involving management, which could prevent escalation.\n\nBut in some cases, especially if the harassment is ongoing and the victim feels unsafe or uncomfortable, going to management is the right step. The key is whether the author's actions were the appropriate way to handle harassment. The author did report it through the proper channels with evidence, which is correct. The CEO's handling of the situation is another matter, but the author's action itself might be justified.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the workplace harassment exists and he reported it, then no. But if the situation was blown out of proportion or if the author acted too rashly without trying to resolve it first, then maybe. The friend's point is that he should have confronted them directly. But if the harassment was persistent and the author felt it was beyond just joking, then reporting it is appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong if the harassment was real and he followed the correct reporting procedures. However, the method of not first trying to address it directly with the colleagues could be a point of contention. But given the severity of the messages, it's possible that direct confrontation would have been ineffective or even risked more harassment. The CEO's action shows that the company took it seriously, so the author might be in the right.\n"
