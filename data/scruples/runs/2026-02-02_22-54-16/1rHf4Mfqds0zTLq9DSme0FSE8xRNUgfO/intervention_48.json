Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old male working at a startup where almost everyone is female. He's in sales and has been performing exceptionally well, earning high commissions. Some of his female coworkers started making hurtful comments about him, including sexist remarks and mockery about his height and appearance. After months of this, he took the matter to the CEO with evidence, leading to two women being fired and others reprimanded. Now, he's feeling guilty and is asking if he did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points. The coworkers were engaging in bullying and harassment, which the author found out through screenshots shown by a friend. He tried to ignore it at first but eventually went to the CEO. The CEO acted by firing two and writing up others. The author's friend is critical of his approach, suggesting he should have confronted them directly instead of going to management.\n\nFrom a workplace ethics standpoint, employees are entitled to a respectful and harassment-free environment. The comments the author received were not just teasing but included sexist and potentially harassing content. The author's actions could be justified as reporting a hostile work environment, which is a legitimate reason to involve HR or higher management. However, the method he used might be questionable. Confronting the issue directly first, as his friend suggested, is often recommended to give the other party a chance to stop the behavior before escalating. \n\nBut the situation here is that the harassment continued over several months, and the author had already tried to brush it off. The comments were ongoing and included things that are not appropriate in a professional setting. In such cases, employees have a right to report harassment. The fact that the company responded by firing two and addressing the issue shows that the behavior was indeed serious. \n\nThe friend's argument that the comments were \"probably joking\" might downplay the severity. The author provided evidence of harmful and sexist remarks, which are not just jokes but potential violations of workplace policies. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision to present all the evidence and push for immediate action could be seen as heavy-handed. Maybe a step-by-step approach, like formal complaints or mediation, could have been better. However, the CEO did take appropriate action, which suggests that the author's report was valid.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to ongoing harassment. While his method might not have been perfect, the content of the messages justifies his concern. The question is whether he was in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards \"No,\" as he was addressing a legitimate issue of workplace harassment. The guilt he feels might stem from the fact that others lost their jobs, but the responsibility for their actions lies with the individuals who made the harmful comments.\n"
