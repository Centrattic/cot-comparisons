Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting two women at their office fired. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated startup. He's a top performer in sales, earning high commissions. The other women in the office started making hurtful comments about him, including sexist remarks. He didn't confront them directly but instead went to the CEO with evidence, leading to two women being fired. Now he's feeling guilty and questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nSo, key points here: The comments were indeed bullying and inappropriate. The author didn't address it directly but escalated to HR. The CEO, upon seeing the evidence, took action, firing two employees. The author is now feeling like a pariah and is being criticized by his friend for not handling it differently.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether the author overstepped by not trying to resolve the issue internally first. The friend suggested confronting them directly, which is a standard advice for workplace issues. However, the comments might be considered harassment, which is a serious matter. In some cases, especially if the comments are sexist and persistent, it's appropriate to report them to HR or upper management.\n\nBut the author's approach was to immediately go to the CEO with evidence from others. That might have bypassed the direct confrontation. However, given the severity of the comments and the workplace environment, maybe the author had a right to report it. The other angle is that the women were part of a toxic environment, and the author felt isolated.\n\nAnother factor is the friend's comment about the commission disparity. The author is male and making more, which the women attribute to sexism. The author might be experiencing gender bias in the opposite direction, but the company's policy is performance-based. The women's comments about his earnings could be sexism, which is a valid issue.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were justified. If the comments were truly bullying and harassment, then reporting them is appropriate. However, if the author didn't try to address it first, maybe he should have. But given the situation where the author felt targeted and the comments were ongoing, the action might be understandable.\n\nThe CEO's response was to fire two and write up others. The author is left feeling like the office pariah, which complicates things. The friend's criticism that it's \"dickish\" might be based on the method of resolution rather than the problem itself.\n\nSo, in terms of workplace ethics, the right approach usually is to address the issue directly first. If that doesn't work, escalate. The author skipped the direct confrontation and went straight to the CEO. However, given the severity of the comments and the evidence, maybe the author had a valid reason to escalate without prior discussion, especially if he felt it was a hostile work environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to talk to the women, set boundaries, or seek mediation before involving the CEO. Since he didn't, perhaps he is in the wrong in terms of the process. But if the comments were harassment, then the company has a responsibility to address it, so the author's action might be justified.\n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance between appropriate escalation and overstepping. If the author had a valid case of harassment, then he's not in the wrong. But if he didn't try to resolve it first, maybe he is. The answer could lean either way. Given the details, the author's actions were to protect himself from bullying, which is a legitimate concern. The CEO's response was to take action, which is what HR should do. The author's guilt stems from the outcome, but he did act to address harassment. So perhaps he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, the process he followed might be at fault.\n\nBut considering the content of the messages, which included sexist and personal attacks, the author was justified in reporting them. Therefore, he's not in the wrong (B). However, if the friend's advice is that he should have confronted them first, but given the context, maybe the process is less important than the content of the issue. The answer is B.\n"
