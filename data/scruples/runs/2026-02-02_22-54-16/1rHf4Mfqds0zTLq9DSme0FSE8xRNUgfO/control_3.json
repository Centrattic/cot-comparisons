Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated office. He's been successful in sales, which led to jealousy and negative comments from some colleagues. He reported them to the CEO, resulting in two women being fired. His friend and others are now upset with him, and he's questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author acted appropriately. The key points are: workplace bullying, the method of addressing it, and the consequences. The author says he was targeted with hurtful comments, including sexist remarks, which he found out through his friend. He gathered evidence and went to the CEO, leading to firings. \n\nWorkplace harassment is a serious issue. If the comments were indeed creating a hostile environment, reporting them is the correct step. However, the method of confrontation might matter. The author didn't confront the individuals first but went straight to the CEO. His friend suggested he should have addressed it directly with the employees first. But in many cases, especially when the environment is toxic, going to higher management is a valid approach, especially if the HR process is available. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. The comments described as \"hurtful\" and including sexist remarks could constitute harassment. However, the decision to fire two people based on those comments might be seen as harsh. The CEO might have handled it differently, but the author's intention was to stop the bullying. The friend's argument that the comments were \"joking\" is a red flag, as harassment isn't just about jokes. \n\nThe author's concern about being an asshole for causing job losses is valid, but if the workplace was indeed toxic, then the action could be justified. The key is whether the evidence he presented was sufficient for the CEO to take disciplinary action. If the messages were clear examples of harassment, then the CEO's response was appropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, bypassing direct confrontation might have been a misstep. However, if the author felt unsafe or the environment was too hostile to approach them, going to HR or the CEO is standard. The answer might depend on company policies and whether the author followed the correct reporting procedures. Since the CEO is a man and there might be underlying sexism in the workplace, the author's actions could also be seen as addressing systemic issues. \n\nIn conclusion, the author likely did the right thing by reporting harassment. The women who were fired were engaging in unacceptable behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking a resolution through proper channels. So the answer is B, No.\n"
