Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting two women at his office fired. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old male in a female-dominated startup. He's a top-performing sales rep, making a lot in commissions. The women in the office started spreading mean messages about him, making fun of his appearance and implying he got ahead because he's a guy. He tried to ignore it, but after a big commission check, he went to the CEO with evidence and got two fired.\n\nNow, the question is whether he did the right thing. The author's friend thinks he was a dick for going straight to the CEO instead of confronting them first. Also, the user thinks the author isn't wrong. So, I need to weigh both sides.\n\nFirst, the harassment aspect: if the messages were really as bad as he says, that's workplace bullying. He provided screenshots, which the CEO took seriously. The CEO fired two and wrote up others. But the friend argues that going to the CEO was harsh and that the messages were just jokes. However, the content of the messages\u2014mocking his appearance, implying sexism\u2014could be considered toxic. The author might have felt it was affecting his work environment.\n\nOn the other hand, did he handle it correctly? The friend suggests confronting them first. Maybe he could have tried to address it directly before escalating. But if the comments were persistent and hurtful, going to HR or the CEO might be the right step. Workplace policies often encourage reporting harassment. The CEO's response was appropriate, but the author now feels like a pariah, which is understandable given the aftermath.\n\nIs it sexism? The women claimed he had better leads because he's a guy, which might touch on valid issues. If the commission structure is truly performance-based, then it's justified. But if there's systemic bias in lead allocation, that's a different issue. However, the author's action was based on the harassment, not the commission disparity.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The existence of harassment, 2) The method of addressing it (direct confrontation vs. going to the CEO), and 3) Whether the punishment was too harsh. The messages were offensive, so firing two for creating a toxic environment might be justified. But maybe the CEO overreacted? The author's friend thinks the messages were just jokes, but the author's evidence shows they were serious. The author's actions were based on protecting himself from a hostile work environment, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong if the harassment was real and he followed proper reporting channels. However, there's room to argue that he could have tried direct confrontation first. But given the severity of the messages and the CEO's response, maybe he was justified. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
