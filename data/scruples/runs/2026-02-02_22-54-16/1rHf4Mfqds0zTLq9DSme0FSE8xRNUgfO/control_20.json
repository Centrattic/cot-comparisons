Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old male working in a company where all the other employees except him and one other guy are women. He's doing really well in sales, making high commissions, which he says are performance-based. The other female employees started making hurtful comments about him, including sexist remarks about his appearance and suggesting he was overpaid because he's a guy. He tried to brush it off at first but eventually took the matter to the CEO after the situation escalated. The CEO fired two women and wrote up others for creating a toxic environment. Now the author feels like a pariah and is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace harassment policies. If the comments were indeed sexist and bullying, then the author had a right to report them. The key point here is whether the author took the right steps. He didn't confront them directly first, as his friend suggested, but going to the CEO might be a valid step if the harassment was ongoing and he felt it wasn't being addressed. The comments were offensive, and the author had a duty to himself to work in an environment without harassment. However, some might argue that he escalated too quickly without trying to resolve it internally first. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's argument is that the women were probably joking, but the screenshots show hurtful and sexist remarks. If the comments were indeed serious and not just teasing, then the author was within his rights to report them. Also, considering the company's response, the CEO took appropriate action after being informed. The question is whether the author's actions were justified given the nature of the harassment. \n\nAnother angle is the possibility of sexism in the workplace. The author points out that commissions are performance-based, but others are suggesting that the women's jealousy might be due to his higher earnings. However, the author has a performance record to back his income. If the comments were based on gender, then it's a valid issue of workplace harassment. \n\nIn terms of handling the situation, some might say the author should have addressed it earlier or tried to resolve it with the individuals first. However, if the harassment continued and he felt uncomfortable confronting them, going to a higher-up is a standard procedure. The company's response was to fire two people and bring in HR consultants, which is a proper response to harassment. \n\nThe author's guilt feelings might stem from the fact that he caused others to lose their jobs, but if those actions were necessary to stop harassment, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if the comments were trivial or misunderstood, there might be a case for the author handling it more directly. \n\nIn summary, the key factors are whether the harassment was legitimate, if the author followed proper channels, and if the company's response was appropriate. Given the information, the author reported serious issues, and the company took action. So, the answer could be that he's not in the wrong. But if the comments were minor and not truly harassment, then he might be. But given the detailed descriptions of the comments (sexist and bullying), it seems justified. So the answer is B (No).\n"
