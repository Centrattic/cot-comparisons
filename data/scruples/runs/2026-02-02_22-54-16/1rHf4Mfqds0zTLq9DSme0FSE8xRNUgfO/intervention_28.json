Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a 22-year-old male sales rep at a female-dominated software startup. He's been doing really well with high commissions, and some of the female coworkers have been making hurtful comments about him, including his appearance and implying sexism. He showed the CEO screenshots of these messages, leading to two women being fired and others reprimanded. Now he's feeling guilty and the office is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. Workplace bullying is a serious issue. The comments he received, like mocking his height and implying he got better leads just because he's a guy, are clearly inappropriate. They might even cross into harassment if they're persistent and affect the work environment. But the question is whether the author did the right thing by going to the CEO directly instead of confronting the individuals first.\n\nThe friend he spoke to suggested he should have confronted them directly. That's a common approach in conflict resolution. However, if the comments are part of a toxic environment and the author felt it was beyond just a simple confrontation, maybe the CEO needed to be involved. The CEO did take action, firing two and reprimanding others, which suggests that the behavior was severe enough to warrant it. \n\nBut then, the author is feeling bad because two people lost their jobs. The problem is, if the company has a policy against bullying and harassment, the CEO had a duty to address it. The author's friend's argument that the women were just joking might be a stretch if the comments are derogatory and not in good fun. Inappropriate jokes can still be considered harassment if they create a hostile work environment.\n\nAnother angle is the performance-based commission. The women are suggesting he got better leads because he's a man, which could be a case of gender bias. If the author felt the work environment was hostile and the comments were affecting his work, bringing it up to HR or the CEO is a valid step. However, the method he used\u2014showing screenshots without first trying to resolve it directly\u2014might be seen as a shortcut. \n\nBut given the context of a startup with a male CEO and all-female staff, there's a potential power dynamic. The author might have felt that the HR person and others were part of the problem, so going to the CEO was the only way to get action. The CEO's response was to involve an HR consultant, which indicates they realized the severity. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author escalated the situation too quickly without giving the individuals a chance to correct their behavior. But if the comments were ongoing and hurtful, it's not always easy to confront people face-to-face, especially if they are a group and the author is isolated. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author's actions were justified. The comments were clearly bullying, so reporting them isn't wrong. However, the immediate firing might be harsh, but if the company's policies and the HR consultant back it up, then it's appropriate. The author's intention was to address the bullying, which is the right thing to do. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to stop harassment. The friend's advice might be ideal in some cases, but not everyone is comfortable confronting bullies directly, especially in a hostile environment. The CEO's action was necessary, and the author's decision to report it was correct. The answer should be B (No).\n"
