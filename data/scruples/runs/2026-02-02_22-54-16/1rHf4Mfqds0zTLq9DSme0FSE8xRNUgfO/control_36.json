Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting two women in their office fired because of bullying and sexist comments.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated startup. He's a top-performing sales rep, making high commissions. Other women started making hurtful comments about his appearance and implying sexism in his success. He brushed it off but eventually showed the CEO screenshots, leading to two firings and others getting written up. Now he's feeling like a pariah and is conflicted about whether he was wrong to do this.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is it right for him to have reported the behavior leading to firings, or should he have handled it differently?\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. Work environment and bullying: The women's comments are clearly inappropriate and create a toxic atmosphere. The HR girl, CTO, and others on the sales team were involved. The author is being bullied, which is a serious workplace issue. The CEO called it workplace bullying, which is a red flag for any company.\n\n2. Performance and commissions: The author's success is based on performance (commissions), but others are suggesting sexism because he's making more. However, the author states the commissions are performance-based, which should be the main factor. The comments about him getting better leads because he's a guy would be discriminatory, which is also a problem.\n\n3. The author's actions: He gathered evidence, went to the CEO, and led to the firings. His friend the office manager says he should have confronted them directly first. But how severe is the harassment? If it's ongoing and the company was unaware, reporting it is a standard procedure. However, the friend's argument is that he didn't address it directly with the people involved first, which is a common advice in workplace conflicts\u2014escalate only after trying to resolve it directly.\n\n4. The CEO's response: The CEO took action, which is good, but the author is now ostracized. The author feels bad about the women losing their jobs, but the other employees might see him as a troublemaker for causing this.\n\n5. The severity of the comments: The messages included jokes about his height and implied sexism. While the friend says these are childish and shouldn't lead to firing, the CEO considered it a toxic environment. The line between joking and harassment can be thin, but if it's persistent and creates a hostile work environment, it's serious.\n\n6. The author's responsibility: Should he have addressed the comments directly with the individuals instead of going to the CEO? Maybe. But if the behavior continued despite his efforts, then reporting would be appropriate. However, the story says he \"brushed this off\" and didn't confront them directly. So maybe he skipped that step, which is why his friend is critical.\n\n7. The outcome: Two women got fired, which is a drastic measure. Was it justified? If the HR consultant later reviews, maybe they will determine if the firings were appropriate. The author might not have known the full context of the other women's actions.\n\n8. Feelings and ethics: The author is conflicted because he cares about the women losing their jobs. But their behavior was harmful. The question is whether the author's method of handling it was wrong.\n\nIn terms of right/wrong, it's about the appropriate way to handle harassment. The standard advice is to address it directly first, then involve HR or higher-ups if necessary. The author didn't do the direct confrontation, so he might be in the wrong for not following that step. However, the content of the messages is pretty clear harassment, so the CEO's action was necessary. The author might be in the right to report it if the harassment was affecting his work. But since he didn't try to resolve it directly first, his approach could be seen as a bit impulsive. \n\nOn the other side, if the messages were serious enough (sexist and personal attacks), then there's a duty to report them. The CEO should handle such issues. But the author's friend points out that they could have just been jokes, so maybe the author overreacted. But the author provided evidence, so the CEO had to act according to company policy.\n\nSo, the dilemma is between the method of addressing the problem and the outcome. The author might be in the right for wanting to stop harassment but in the wrong for not following the proper steps first. Alternatively, the harassment was real and he had a right to report it if it was affecting his ability to work.\n"
