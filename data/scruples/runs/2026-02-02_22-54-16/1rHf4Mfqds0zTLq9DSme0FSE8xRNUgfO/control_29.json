Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting two women fired at his office. The situation is a bit complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated startup. He's been successful in sales, making high commissions, which has led to some backlash from his female coworkers. They've made some hurtful comments about him, including his appearance and implying he got ahead because he's a guy. He tried to brush it off but finally showed the CEO screenshots of the messages, leading to two women being fired and others reprimanded.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Workplace Bullying and Harassment**: The comments he received\u2014mocking his height, appearance, and suggesting sexism\u2014are serious. If these are true, they create a toxic work environment. The CEO called it workplace bullying, which is a valid concern.\n\n2. **Handling the Situation**: The author didn't confront the coworkers directly first. His friend advised him to talk to them first, but he went straight to the CEO. While confronting them might have been a better first step, the severity of the harassment might justify escalating to management, especially if it's affecting his work and wellbeing.\n\n3. **Consequences**: Firing two employees is a severe action. The CEO might have considered the context, like the ongoing harassment and the need to maintain a respectful workplace. However, the author's role in initiating this action could be seen as harsh, especially if the women's actions were not malicious but more of workplace banter. But the screenshots he showed were offensive, which might not be just jokes.\n\n4. **Intentions and Feelings**: The author didn't act out of malice but to stop the harassment. He feels guilty, which suggests he's considering the impact on others. However, the outcome is that two people lost their jobs, which is a big deal. The question is whether the means justified the ends.\n\n5. **Sexism Factor**: The author's friend brought up sexism, noting he earned more than others. If the commissions are truly performance-based, then it's about results, not gender. But the coworkers' claims of sexism might indicate underlying gender bias, which complicates the situation.\n\n6. **Workplace Policies**: The CEO involved an HR consultant, which is a good step. The company might have had policies against harassment, so the author following proper channels by reporting the issue could be justified.\n\nIn summary, the author acted to address harassment, which is valid. However, bypassing direct confrontation might be seen as a misstep. The firing of two employees is severe, but if the harassment was documented and the company acted within its policies, it might be justified. The author's guilt is understandable, but whether he's in the wrong depends on the intention and the company's response. Since he followed the proper reporting channels and the CEO acted on it, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he handled it could be debated. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are nuances.\n"
