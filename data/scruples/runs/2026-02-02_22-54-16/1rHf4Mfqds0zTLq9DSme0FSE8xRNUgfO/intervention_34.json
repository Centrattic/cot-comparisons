Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for getting two women at his office fired because of their bullying comments. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 22-year-old sales rep in a company that's mostly women. He's making a lot of commission, which leads to some negative comments from his female colleagues. These comments include things like mocking his height, implying he has a small penis, and blaming his success on being a man. After a big commission check, the bullying escalates, and he takes the screenshots to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others written up. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nThe user thinks he's not in the wrong. Let me consider the arguments. On one side, workplace bullying is not acceptable. If the comments were offensive and created a hostile environment, then reporting it is a valid action. The author did go to the CEO instead of confronting them directly, which his friend criticized. However, the friend also suggested that the women might have been joking, but the screenshots show serious, hurtful things. \n\nAnother angle is the response from the CEO. He fired two women and wrote up others, so the punishment might have been disproportionate. The author might feel guilty because he didn't want to fire people, but the harassment was real. The friend mentioned that confronting directly might have been better, but if the bullying continued despite that, going to HR could still be necessary. Also, the friend's comment about sexism is a point. If the author's higher commissions are due to performance and not gender, then the women's claims of sexism are unfounded. However, the author's friend's perspective highlights that maybe the author didn't handle it the best way, but the core issue is the bullying.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he reported legitimate harassment, then no. But if he overreacted or didn't give them a chance, maybe yes. The key factors here are whether the comments were indeed bullying (which they seem to be) and whether the CEO's actions were appropriate. The author's actions were in response to a toxic environment, so he's not at fault for seeking resolution. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful about the nuances.\n"
