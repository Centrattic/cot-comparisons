Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for getting two women fired at their office. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old male in a female-dominated workplace where he's a top performer, especially in sales. He's making a lot of commission, which leads to some catty and hurtful comments from some of the female coworkers. They make fun of his appearance and imply that his success is due to being a man. The author collects evidence of these messages and reports them to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others written up. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the nature of the comments, the appropriate response, and whether the consequences were too harsh. The coworkers were making sexist and bullying comments, which is definitely not okay. The author had a right to feel harmed by their behavior. However, the way he handled it might be questionable. He didn't confront them directly first, as his friend suggested. Instead, he went straight to the CEO with all the evidence. \n\nThe friend's argument is that he should have addressed the issue directly with the people involved before escalating. That makes sense because direct communication can sometimes resolve issues without involving higher-ups. But the problem here is that the comments were ongoing and possibly creating a hostile work environment. The company has policies against bullying, so reporting it isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the severity of the punishment. Firing two employees for workplace bullying is a serious action. The author might have felt justified if the comments were truly malicious and persistent. However, the friend mentioned that the other women were probably just joking, which could mean the author overreacted. But the screenshots showed they were making hurtful remarks, which might have crossed the line into harassment.\n\nThe author also has to consider the impact on the women. Losing jobs is a major consequence, and even if they were at fault, it's a harsh outcome. The CEO might have handled it differently, but the author's intent was to stop the bullying, which is valid. \n\nIn terms of workplace policies, if the company has a clear process for reporting harassment, following that process is the right thing to do. The author did report the issue, and the CEO took action. However, the method of handling it could be debated. Maybe there should have been a formal investigation first, but the author's actions led to immediate consequences.\n\nSo, weighing all this: The author faced bullying and took action to address it, which is understandable. However, he didn't try to resolve it directly first, which could have been a better approach. But given the context of a hostile work environment and the potential for ongoing harassment, his actions might be justified. The answer hinges on whether the response was proportionate. The CEO decided to fire two employees, which is the company's call, but the author's initial step of reporting was appropriate. \n\nThe friend's criticism that he should have confronted them first is valid, but if the bullying was severe and persistent, reporting might be necessary. The author's friend also suggested it was sexism, so there's an underlying issue there. The author might be in the right for standing up against harassment, but the method of handling it could be questioned. However, given the evidence he had, it's hard to say he's entirely at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he reported workplace bullying, which is the correct procedure. The consequences were handled by the CEO, and while the method could have been improved, the intent was to stop harassment, which is not the author's fault.\n"
