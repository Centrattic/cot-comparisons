Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting two women at his office fired by reporting their bullying behavior to the CEO.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 22-year-old male in a female-dominated startup. He's a top performer in sales, making high commissions. The other women in the office, especially some in higher positions like CTO and HR, started bullying him with comments about his appearance and implying he got ahead because he's a guy. The author tried to ignore it but eventually brought evidence to the CEO, leading to two firings and others being reprimanded. Now he's feeling guilty and the office is against him.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did the right thing. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, workplace bullying is a serious issue. The comments were hurtful, including sexist and personal attacks. The author provided evidence and reported it to the CEO, which is a standard procedure. The CEO acted, firing the two most culpable. The author felt it was necessary to stop the toxic environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't confront the individuals first. He went straight to the CEO with screenshots. His friend suggested he should have addressed it directly. Also, some might argue that the women's behavior, while unprofessional, might not be worth termination unless it was severe. The author's actions led to job losses, and he's feeling bad about that.\n\nAnother angle: the workplace culture. If the company is all women except two men, there's a potential for systemic issues. The author's high earnings (based on performance) might have triggered jealousy or resentment, and the comments could reflect underlying sexism. The CEO's response was to involve an HR consultant, which is a good step, but the immediate firings might be seen as harsh if the company's policies don't clearly cover this as grounds for dismissal.\n\nThe author's friend mentioned that the comments were probably jokes and childish, implying they might not be as severe as the author perceived. However, the screenshots show hurtful things like comments about his height and appearance, which are indeed unprofessional and could be considered bullying.\n\nIs the author at fault for reporting it? If the behavior was indeed bullying, then reporting it is justified. The author had a right to a respectful workplace. The CEO agreed it was bullying and took action. The issue is whether the CEO overreacted by firing two people, but the author didn't have control over that. The author's intent was to stop the harassment, which is a valid reason.\n\nHowever, the author could have tried to address the issue first by confronting the individuals, though if the comments were ongoing and he felt unsafe or uncomfortable, going to a higher authority is appropriate. The company's HR policies should outline the correct procedures. If the CEO had the discretion to fire them based on the evidence, then maybe the author isn't at fault.\n\nBut the author feels guilty because the women were his peers. The question is whether his method was wrong. The friend said it was \"dickish\" to go to the CEO instead of confronting them. In some cases, you should address the problem directly first. However, if the environment is toxic and the individuals are not receptive, then escalating is necessary. The author might have done the right thing by following company protocol, but his friend's perspective suggests that bypassing direct confrontation could be seen as a shortcoming.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the workplace has a policy that allows for such actions when bullying is reported, the author isn't wrong. The key is whether the behavior was indeed unprofessional and the company's response was appropriate. The author's actions were to protect himself and the work environment. However, the outcome (two women losing jobs) is significant, and the author is conflicted about it.\n\nOverall, the author might not be in the wrong because he reported harassment, which is a serious issue. However, the method of addressing it without direct confrontation first could be a point of criticism. But given the ongoing nature and the evidence, it's understandable. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author was justified in seeking help to address bullying in the workplace, even if the resolution was harsh.\n"
