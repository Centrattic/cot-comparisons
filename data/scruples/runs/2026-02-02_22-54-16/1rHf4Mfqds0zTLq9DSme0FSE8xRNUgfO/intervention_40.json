Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting two women at their office fired. The situation involves workplace bullying, specifically targeted at the author because he's a high-performing male employee in a mostly female startup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of the author. He says he was being mocked and harassed by some female colleagues, which included hurtful comments about his appearance and his gender. When he presented these screenshots to the CEO, the CEO took action, firing two of them and writing up others. The author now feels guilty because the women were colleagues and he's concerned about their loss of jobs, but he also felt like he had to act because the harassment was ongoing and affecting his work environment.\n\nThe key points here are: 1. The harassment was severe and targeted him based on his gender, 2. The comments were hurtful and unprofessional, 3. The CEO was involved and took disciplinary action, 4. The author's friend (the office manager) later criticized him for going to the CEO instead of confronting the women directly, 5. The friend also mentioned that the comments might be considered childish and not grounds for termination.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is at fault. The initial response of the author was to address the issue through the proper channel (the CEO) rather than handle it himself. Workplace harassment is a serious matter, and reporting it is generally the correct step. However, the author's friend suggests that confronting them directly first would have been better. But the author might not have felt comfortable doing that, especially if the harassment was ongoing. Repeated bullying can escalate, so going to HR or a higher-up is a standard response in such cases.\n\nAnother angle is the CEO's reaction. He was shocked and took action, which indicates that the behavior was indeed unacceptable. The company's decision to involve an HR consultant shows they wanted to address the problem seriously. The author's intention was to stop the harassment, which is understandable. However, the consequences were that two women lost their jobs. The author might feel responsible for their job loss, but if their actions were part of a toxic environment, the company had the right to discipline them. \n\nBut wait, the friend's comment that the comments were \"childish\" and \"probably joking\" raises a point. Sometimes, workplace banter can be taken too far, but if it's truly harassment, then it's unprofessional. The author did provide evidence (screenshots), so it's not a case of just making up the issue. The company's policies and the CEO's role in maintaining a respectful workplace are important here. The author was within his rights to report the harassment. \n\nHowever, the method of reporting\u2014collecting screenshots and approaching the CEO directly\u2014might be seen as a bit abrupt. Maybe he should have first tried to address the issue with the individuals or through HR's formal process. But in this case, the CEO is the only male in the exec team, and the author might not have felt that HR (who was one of the harassers) could be trusted. So, going to the CEO directly makes sense in that context.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether he handled the situation appropriately. Reporting workplace harassment is a responsible action, but the outcome led to colleagues losing their jobs. The author might have felt the environment was untenable, and the CEO acted accordingly. The friend's criticism about it being a \"dickish thing to do\" stems from the fact that the author might have overreacted, but the harassment was real. \n\nIn many workplaces, creating a hostile environment is grounds for disciplinary action. The author's actions were aimed at stopping the harassment, which is in line with company policies. The problem is the emotional response from the author and the friend, but legally and ethically, reporting such behavior is correct. The author isn't in the wrong because he addressed a serious issue through the proper channels. However, the friend's perspective highlights that maybe direct confrontation could have been a first step. But given the context and the CEO's authority, the author's approach was justified. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He reported harassment, which is a valid and necessary step. The outcome, while harsh, was the company's decision based on the evidence provided.\n"
