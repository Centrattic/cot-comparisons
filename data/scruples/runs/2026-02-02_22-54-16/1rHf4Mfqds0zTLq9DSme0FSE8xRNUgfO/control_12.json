Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they did the right thing by getting two women from their office fired after they were spreading mean messages about him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 22-year-old male in a female-dominated tech startup. He's a top performer in sales, making a lot of commissions. Other female coworkers, especially some in key roles like CTO and HR, started making mean comments about him, including sexist remarks and personal attacks. These comments were hurtful and created a toxic environment. Despite this, he tried to brush it off and keep things professional. However, after a big commission check, the backlash intensified. He showed the CEO screenshots of these messages, leading to two women being fired and others written up. Now he's feeling like a pariah and is questioning if he was wrong to take that approach.\n\nSo the main points here are: 1) Were the coworkers' actions appropriate? 2) Did the author handle the situation in the best way possible? 3) Is the author at fault for using the CEO to get them fired instead of addressing it directly?\n\nStarting with the coworkers' behavior. The messages included personal attacks, sexist comments, and creating a hostile work environment. That's definitely not okay. Workplace bullying is a serious issue, and if the comments were as severe as described, they violate professional standards. The author had the right to a respectful workplace, so the coworkers were definitely in the wrong.\n\nNext, the author's actions. He tried to ignore it at first, which is understandable, but when the harassment continued and escalated, he took the matter to the CEO with evidence. The CEO then took action, firing two people. The author's friend suggested he should have confronted them directly first, which is a common advice in conflict resolution. However, in cases of harassment or bullying, especially when it's ongoing and creating a toxic environment, it's often advisable to report it to higher management or HR. The friend's point is valid that confronting directly might be a first step, but if that doesn't work or if the harassment is severe, reporting is necessary.\n\nAnother angle is the question of whether the punishment was too harsh. The author's friend argued that the women were just joking and that the comments, while hurtful, don't warrant termination. However, if the messages were explicit, derogatory, and part of a pattern of bullying, then the CEO's response might be justified. The line between joking and harassment can be thin, but if it's affecting someone's work environment negatively, it's a serious issue.\n\nAlso, there's a potential sexism angle mentioned by the friend. The author making more money than the women might be a point of contention, but since commissions are performance-based, that's legitimate. However, the coworkers' claims that he got better leads might imply gender bias. The author's friend suggested that the situation might involve sexism, which adds another layer. The author might not have intended to be sexist, but the outcome could be seen as reinforcing gender dynamics in the workplace, which could be a point of criticism.\n\nNow, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? The key points are whether he escalated the issue appropriately. If the work environment became intolerable due to harassment, then reporting it is justified. However, bypassing direct confrontation and going straight to the CEO might not be the best approach in all cases. But given that the harassment was ongoing, and the coworkers didn't change their behavior after initial instances, the author might have had reason to escalate.\n\nOn the other hand, if the CEO's response was overly harsh (firing two people for what could be seen as workplace cattiness), that could reflect poorly on the author's judgment. However, the CEO is responsible for the work environment, so if the author presented a clear case of harassment, the CEO's actions were within their right.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, he might not be entirely at fault for reporting the harassment, as he had the right to a safe work environment. However, his approach could have been more direct first\u2014like talking to the individuals involved or HR, but since the CEO is also the owner, maybe he didn't have another option. Also, the fact that he waited until the situation escalated might be a point against him, but if the comments were persistent and harmful, it's understandable.\n\nAnother factor is the author's motivation. He might have felt targeted due to his gender and high performance, which could mean there was a valid reason to address the harassment. But using the CEO's intervention to fire two employees instead of seeking a more mediated solution might be seen as extreme.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer isn't black and white. The author is in a position where he faced a hostile work environment and took action to protect himself, which is his right. However, the method he used (going straight to the CEO and resulting in firings) could be seen as heavy-handed, especially if the women's actions were more about cattiness than malicious harassment. The friend's suggestion that a direct confrontation first might have been better is valid. But in a case of bullying, direct confrontation isn't always safe or effective, so reporting it is also acceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had valid reasons to report the harassment, the way he handled it might not have been the most appropriate. However, he's not entirely in the wrong because he was addressing a hostile environment. The answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong (B), but there are nuances.\n"
