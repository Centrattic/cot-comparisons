As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for letting a thief escape with a Salvation Army bucket. The author intervened by grabbing the thief, causing him to fall, but then let him run off when the thief went for the bucket instead of fighting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is a bouncer with some training, so he's capable of handling himself. He physically confronted the thief, which stopped him temporarily. The key point here is whether he should have continued to pursue or stop the thief after the initial confrontation. \n\nThe author's reasoning was about risk assessment. He didn't want to risk getting stabbed over a small amount of money. His girlfriend and his boss (a former cop) support his decision. The other woman was upset and called him out, but her tone was sarcastic and confrontational. \n\nLegally, in many places, you're not obligated to put yourself in danger to stop a crime. The concept of \"duty to rescue\" varies by jurisdiction, but in general, people aren't required to help unless there's a specific legal obligation. The author's decision to prioritize his safety, especially with his training and the potential for escalation, seems reasonable.\n\nMoral-wise, there's a debate. The author did intervene initially, which prevented the theft temporarily. Then, the choice to let the thief go might be seen as a pragmatic decision to avoid worse consequences. On the other hand, the other woman's reaction suggests she felt he should have done more, which is a common point in these AITA stories.\n\nThe author also mentions feeling like Peter Parker, referencing Uncle Ben's death from letting a criminal go. That analogy is a heavy one, but the context here is different. Uncle Ben's death was due to a failure to act, but in this case, the author did act, then had to make a split-second decision under pressure. \n\nConsidering all factors: the author's safety, the small amount of money involved, the support from girlfriend and boss, and the lack of legal duty, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong). The woman's aggressive response seems unreasonable given the circumstances. The author made a judgment call to avoid unnecessary risk, which is defendable.\n"
