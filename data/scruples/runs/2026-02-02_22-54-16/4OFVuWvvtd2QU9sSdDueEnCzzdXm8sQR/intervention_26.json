As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user (the author) and their girlfriend were walking to the grocery store from Goodwill. They see a man running with a Salvation Army bucket, chased by two women. The author grabs the man's backpack, yanks him down, but then the man goes for the bucket instead of fighting the author. The author decides not to chase him further, thinking about the risks involved, like getting hurt. The women are upset, especially the short one who is into being a police officer and confronts the author. The author responds by yelling and leaving.\n\nFirst, let me consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, a person can use reasonable force to protect property. However, the author stopped the thief initially by grabbing the backpack and causing him to fall. At that point, maybe the police should have been called immediately, but the author didn't. Instead, they let the thief escape when he went for the bucket again. The author's reasoning was about self-preservation and not wanting to risk injury over a small amount of money.\n\nThe author's girlfriend and boss (ex-cop) think they did the right thing. That\u2019s a point in their favor. The ex-cop's opinion might carry weight in terms of legal judgment. However, the other woman is upset and even threatens to call the police. But the author didn't do anything illegal when they initially intervened, right? Grabbing someone to stop them from taking a bucket might be considered reasonable force if they believed it was theft. However, if the man was fleeing and the author let him go, maybe that's just a personal choice not to escalate the situation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had a duty to continue the confrontation. In civilian terms, there's no legal duty for a bystander to intervene or to pursue a criminal once the immediate threat is neutralized. The author already attempted to stop the thief once. When the thief decided to go for the bucket again, the author chose not to follow, which could be seen as a reasonable decision to avoid further conflict and potential harm, especially given their training as a bouncer but also acknowledging their own limits.\n\nThe author's main concern was self-preservation. The money in question was $50 in quarters, which is not a huge amount. The risk of getting stabbed versus the value of the property might be seen as disproportionate. The author's response to the woman's accusations was angry, but maybe that's just an emotional reaction to being criticized for a tough choice.\n\nThe other woman's reaction, wanting to involve the police, could be her trying to escalate the situation. However, if the author didn't commit a crime by letting the thief go, then the woman's threat might be unfounded. The author didn't use excessive force or continue the confrontation beyond the initial stop.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author made a split-second decision based on risk assessment. They didn't do anything illegal, and their reasoning about not wanting to risk serious injury over a small amount of money is understandable. The girlfriend and the ex-cop support their decision, which suggests that others in similar situations might agree. The author might feel guilty because they didn't follow through, but legally and ethically, it's a matter of personal choice and judgment in the moment. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
