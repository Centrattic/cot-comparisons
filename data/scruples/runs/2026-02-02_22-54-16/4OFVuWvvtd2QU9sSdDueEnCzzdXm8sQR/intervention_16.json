As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person and their girlfriend were walking past the Salvation Army bucket. A guy ran by with the bucket, and two women chased him. The author grabbed his backpack and threw him down, but when the thief went for the bucket again instead of fighting, the author let him go. The other woman was upset, called him out, and he responded by yelling and leaving. His girlfriend and his boss (a former cop) think he did the right thing, but he feels guilty like Peter Parker.\n\nFirst, let's consider the facts. The Salvation Army bucket is a public donation box. The thief took it, but the author intervened initially. Then, when the thief went for the bucket instead of attacking, the author decided not to pursue. The key here is whether he had a duty to stop the thief beyond that point.\n\nThe author mentions being a bouncer with some training. He made a judgment call based on the situation. He thought about the risks of getting hurt versus the value of the money. The thief was willing to fight, so maybe the author didn't want to escalate. The other woman was upset, but she was a volunteer or someone else. The ex-cop boss approved, which might indicate that from a law enforcement perspective, the author's decision was reasonable. \n\nThe argument that he's in the wrong would be that he didn't do everything possible to stop the theft. But on the other hand, he did intervene initially and then assessed the risk. The value of the money was low, and personal safety is a priority. Also, the thief was fleeing, and the author wasn't in a position to pursue further without help.\n\nThe analogy to Peter Parker is interesting. However, in real life, not everyone is obligated to be a hero. The author's concern about getting stabbed is valid. Personal safety is paramount. The other woman's reaction might be harsh, but that doesn't mean the author's decision was wrong. The fact that his girlfriend and his boss support him suggests others see it as a reasonable choice.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author made a split-second decision considering the risks. He didn't let the thief get away initially\u2014he tackled him. Then, when the situation changed, he made a choice to avoid potential harm. The value of the money was low, and he wasn't in a position to pursue safely. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
