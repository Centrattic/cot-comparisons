As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they saw a guy stealing a Salvation Army bucket, chased him down, got him on the ground, but then let him run off when he went for the bucket instead of fighting. The women, especially the one going into the police academy, called them out for not stopping the thief. The question is whether the author did the right thing or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is committing a theft, can you use force to stop them? Generally, people can use reasonable force to prevent a crime. But when the thief is trying to escape, the use of force might be less justified. In the scenario, the author physically restrained the man initially, but when the thief went for the bucket again, the author decided not to pursue. \n\nThe author mentions that they considered the risk of getting hurt. They're a bouncer with some training, so they might be more capable than the average person, but they still assessed the risk. The bucket had $50 in quarters. The author's reasoning was that the potential harm to themselves wasn't worth the relatively small amount of money. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The Salvation Army is a charity, so the money is for a good cause. The thief took that money, which affects a nonprofit. The author stopped the thief temporarily but let him go. The other woman seems upset that the thief wasn't apprehended. The author's girlfriend and boss support them, but the other woman is angry. \n\nAnother angle: the author could have called the police instead of trying to handle it themselves. Maybe they didn't have their phone on them, or they thought the police wouldn't respond quickly enough. But if they were in an area with police presence or could have reported the theft later, maybe they should have done that. \n\nAlso, the author felt conflicted, comparing themselves to Peter Parker, where letting the thief go led to negative consequences. But in that case, Peter wasn't aware of the consequences. Here, the author made a conscious decision based on their assessment of the risks. \n\nThe key points are the reasonableness of their actions. Using force to subdue someone can lead to legal issues if it's excessive. Since the thief was fleeing and not threatening violence, the author might have been within their rights to let him go. Also, the value of the stolen property is low, so the priority might be personal safety over pursuing a minor theft. \n\nIn many legal systems, the use of force is allowed to protect property, but only if it's reasonable. Once the thief is fleeing, the author's risk of injury might outweigh the need to pursue. The author's training as a bouncer could mean they have some skills, but it's still a dangerous situation, especially if the thief had a weapon. \n\nThe other woman's reaction is part of the situation. She's in the police academy, so she might have a different perspective, seeing it as a duty to stop crime. But civilians aren't legally required to intervene, and sometimes it's safer not to. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision to let the thief go after an initial confrontation, considering the risks and the low value of the stolen property, might be seen as a reasonable choice. They took action to stop the theft initially but assessed that pursuing further was not worth the risk. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
