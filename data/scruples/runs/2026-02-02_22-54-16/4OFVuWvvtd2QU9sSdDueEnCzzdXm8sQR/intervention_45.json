As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is about a guy who stopped a thief from taking a Salvation Army bucket, but then let the thief run off. The author is a bouncer with some training, so he's capable of handling himself. When he tried to grab the thief, the thief was about to fight, but then the thief decided to go after the bucket and run away. The author chose not to pursue, considering the risks of getting hurt for a small amount of money.\n\nHmm, the main question is whether he was in the wrong for not stopping the thief completely. On one hand, he did intervene initially by stopping the thief and getting the bucket back. But the thief then tried to rush him, so he stepped back. The author's reasoning is about self-preservation and the potential danger, especially since there were no other people around. His boss, an ex-cop, agreed with him, and his girlfriend supported him too. But someone else was upset, calling him out for not doing more.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's judgment of the situation. He assessed the risk and decided that the value of the money wasn't worth risking his safety. It's important to consider that the Salvation Army bucket is a public donation, and the thief was trying to steal from a non-profit. But the author's actions led to the thief escaping without further consequences. \n\nThe other person in the situation, the woman who was sarcastic and then got angry, seems to have a strong opinion about police work and justice. She might believe that everyone should step in regardless of personal risk. But the author's perspective is about realistic self-protection and not overcommitting in a potentially dangerous scenario.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, some might argue that he had a duty to do more, while others would say he acted responsibly by not endangering himself for a small amount. The value of the money is low ($50 in quarters), and the risk of injury is high. The author's training and job as a bouncer suggest he's aware of physical confrontations and the importance of de-escalation or assessing when to engage.\n\nLooking at similar scenarios, like a person intervening in a crime but realizing the threat is still active, the standard advice is to use judgment and not to put oneself in unnecessary danger. Law enforcement officers are trained to handle such situations, but civilians aren't expected to be heroes if it puts them at risk. The author's boss, an ex-cop, agreeing with him adds weight to the idea that his decision was reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nThe comparison to Peter Parker is interesting. In that case, Uncle Ben's death is a result of letting a thief go, which is a fictional scenario with tragic consequences. However, in real life, the stakes here are much lower, and the author made a calculated decision based on the threat level. The thief didn't harm anyone, just stole a bucket, so the immediate danger wasn't life-threatening, but the potential for escalation was there when the thief tried to fight.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to let the thief go after retrieving the bucket seems justified given the risk assessment and the lack of severe consequences for his inaction. The value of the stolen money is minimal compared to the risk of personal injury. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing safety over a potentially dangerous pursuit.\n"
