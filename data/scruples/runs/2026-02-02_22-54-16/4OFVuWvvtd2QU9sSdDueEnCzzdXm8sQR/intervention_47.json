As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author did the wrong thing by not stopping the thief after initially grabbing him. The situation involves a Salvation Army bucket being stolen.\n\nFirst, the author physically attempted to stop the thief by grabbing him, causing him to fall. The thief then chose to go for the bucket instead of fighting the author. The author considered the risks, like getting hurt, and decided not to pursue further. The key points here are the author's assessment of danger and the value of the stolen items.\n\nThe author mentions being a bouncer with some combat training, so they're aware of their limitations. The thief had the upper hand once he went for the bucket, and the author didn't want to risk their safety for a relatively small amount of money ($50 in quarters). The other woman's harsh reaction is also a factor, leading to a conflict.\n\nLegally, using force to prevent a theft can be justified, but it depends on the circumstances. However, once the thief is up and running, continuing to pursue might escalate the situation. The author's decision to prioritize personal safety is a common consideration in self-defense. The girlfriend and the ex-cop boss agreeing that it was the right choice supports that stance.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels guilty, comparing it to Peter Parker's regret, but others are validating their decision. The main question is whether the author had a duty to intervene further. Since it's a public situation and not a direct threat to themselves beyond the thief's actions, the duty isn't clear. The risk of serious harm (like being stabbed) for a non-lethal theft might not justify further action, especially when others are already pursuing the thief.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author likely isn't in the wrong. They took initial action, assessed the risk, and made a decision based on safety. The other woman's judgment doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
