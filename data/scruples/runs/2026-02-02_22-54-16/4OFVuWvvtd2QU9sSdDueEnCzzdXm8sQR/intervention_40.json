As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend were walking when they saw a man running away with a Salvation Army bucket. Two women were chasing him. The author grabbed the guy, threw him down, but then let him go when he went for the bucket instead of confronting him. The author considered the risks of getting hurt versus the value of the money. The other woman was upset, and the author felt conflicted afterward.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In most places, you can't just physically confront someone unless it's to prevent a crime in progress or protect yourself. The author did grab the thief, which could be justified if they were stopping a theft. But then when the thief tried to run with the bucket, the author let him go. Legally, maybe the initial confrontation was okay, but pursuing further could lead to issues if the thief used force.\n\nThen there's the personal safety aspect. The author mentioned being a bouncer with some training, but still, the risk of being stabbed was a concern. The value of the money was low\u2014$50 in quarters. It's a tough call whether it's worth risking injury for. If the author felt it wasn't worth the risk, maybe that's a valid personal choice.\n\nMoral judgment: The author's intention was to stop the theft, which is commendable. However, leaving the situation when the risk is high might be seen as not following through. But the author made a conscious decision based on safety, which others (like his girlfriend and ex-cop boss) supported. The other woman's reaction is harsh, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nAlso, the author didn't cause any harm. He stopped the thief initially but let him go when the situation escalated. The thief didn't attack him, so the author didn't have to use more force. The decision to prioritize personal safety over the money might be seen as reasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author made a split-second decision considering safety and the value involved. Others supported his choice. The key factors are legal justification for the initial action, the risk assessment, and the lack of further confrontation. The author didn't do anything illegal, and the decision to let go was based on self-preservation. Therefore, he's probably not in the wrong.\n"
