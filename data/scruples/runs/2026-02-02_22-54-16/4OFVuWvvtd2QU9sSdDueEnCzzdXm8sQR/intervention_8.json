As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author did the wrong thing by not stopping the thief after initially confronting him.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author sees someone running off with a Salvation Army bucket. He grabs the guy, throws him to the ground, and the thief tries to fight. But the author lets him go after a moment of consideration. The thief then escapes. The two women, especially the short, overweight one, get angry at the author for not stopping him. The author's girlfriend and boss support him. The author is conflicted, comparing himself to Peter Parker's regret.\n\nNow, considering the options A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and the justification. The author used force initially, which might be justified as self-defense or trying to stop a crime. But when the thief went for the bucket instead of attacking, the author decided not to pursue. The reasoning given is the risk of personal harm versus the value of the money. The Salvation Army is a non-profit, so the money is for a good cause, but the amount is $50 in quarters, which isn't life-changing. \n\nThe author's boss, an ex-cop, and the girlfriend support him, suggesting that maybe the decision was reasonable. The author also has training but didn't want to escalate the situation. The other woman's reaction seems harsh, possibly because she expects more intervention. \n\nIn terms of legal or moral wrongness, the author didn't commit a crime by not pursuing. Stopping a thief can be a personal choice based on the situation. The author did act initially, then assessed the risk and chose self-preservation. The moral dilemma here is between personal safety and doing what's right. Since the author did intervene initially but then realized the potential danger, it's a judgment call. The fact that others support him, and the value involved isn't high, leans towards B (not wrong). The comparison to Peter Parker is emotional but not necessarily a moral failing here.\n"
