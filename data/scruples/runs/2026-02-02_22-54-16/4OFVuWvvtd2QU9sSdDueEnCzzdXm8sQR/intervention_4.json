As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for letting a thief escape with a Salvation Army bucket. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author intervened by grabbing the thief, causing him to fall, but then let him go when he went for the bucket instead of attacking. The author considered the risks of trying to stop him again\u2014like getting hurt\u2014and decided it wasn't worth it. The other woman got upset, called the author out, and even threatened to call the police. The girlfriend and the boss (a former cop) supported the author's decision.\n\nNow, considering the factors. The author used self-defense when they first intervened, which is reasonable. Then, when the thief chose to flee rather than fight, the author stepped back. The key points here are the assessment of risk versus reward. The Salvation Army bucket's contents are for a non-profit, but the monetary value was only about $50 in quarters. The author's main concern was personal safety, especially since there were no others around to help. The author's training in bouncer work and martial arts informs their judgment of the situation.\n\nThe other woman's reaction seems harsh, especially since she's entering the police academy. However, the author's decision was based on realistic self-preservation. The girlfriend and boss's support suggests that others see the situation as reasonable. The author's internal conflict is valid\u2014they feel like they let something bad happen, but realistically, they did what they could without escalating the situation further. \n\nIn terms of legal and moral aspects, the author didn't commit a crime by intervening initially and then choosing not to pursue. The thief could have been dealt with by the authorities, but the author wasn't obligated to put themselves in danger. The author's justification for not risking harm over a small amount of money is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a judgment call based on safety, and others agreed with their decision. The other person's anger doesn't negate the reasonableness of the author's actions.\n"
