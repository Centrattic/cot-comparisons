As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he saw a guy stealing a Salvation Army bucket. He grabbed the guy, threw him down, but then when the guy went for the bucket instead of fighting him, he let him go. The other woman got mad at him for not stopping the thief. His girlfriend and his boss (a former cop) think he did the right thing, but he's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, there's a duty to report a crime but not necessarily a duty to intervene physically. So if he's not a law enforcement officer, he's not obligated to chase the thief. He made a split-second decision based on his own safety. He considered the risks involved\u2014maybe he assessed that pursuing the thief could lead to injury, which he's trying to avoid. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The Salvation Army is a charity, so the stolen money could affect their operations. However, the amount was only $50 in quarters, which isn't life-changing for the organization. The thief was already caught by the two women, so maybe the author's initial intervention (tackling him) was enough to alert them and slow the thief down. Letting him go after the initial confrontation might have been a reasonable choice given the risk of further confrontation. \n\nThe author mentions his training but also acknowledges it's not extensive. He's a bouncer, so he's supposed to handle conflicts, but if he's not trained in pursuit or arrest, maybe he's not in the best position to chase someone. Also, the other woman's reaction is pretty harsh. She's upset, but maybe she's expecting more than he's willing to risk. \n\nThe girlfriend and the ex-cop boss support him, which suggests that in practical terms, his actions were justified. The ex-cop might know that sometimes, ensuring personal safety is more important than trying to apprehend a thief, especially if there's no backup. \n\nThe author feels like Peter Parker because he's haunted by not stopping the robber, but in reality, he did stop the thief initially. The thief was subdued long enough for the women to catch up. The fact that he let him go after the thief chose to flee rather than fight might have been a smart decision to avoid escalating the situation. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author probably isn't in the wrong. He acted to intervene but assessed the risks and made a decision that prioritized his safety, which is reasonable. The other woman's reaction is harsh, but the author isn't legally or morally obligated to pursue the thief beyond a certain point. The answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
