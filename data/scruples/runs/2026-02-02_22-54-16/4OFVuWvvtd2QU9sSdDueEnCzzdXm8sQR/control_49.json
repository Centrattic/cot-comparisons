As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they saw a guy stealing a Salvation Army bucket. They chased him down, tackled him, but then when he went for the bucket instead of fighting, they let him go. The women who were chasing him are upset, and one of them gets into an argument with the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They mentioned they're a bouncer with some training, so they know how to handle themselves. The key points they made are about the risk of getting hurt versus the value of the money. They thought about the best and worst case scenarios. The worst case was getting stabbed for $50 in quarters. That seems like a big risk for a relatively small amount of money.\n\nSalvation Army buckets are often seen as charitable, so people might feel a moral obligation to protect them. But the author's perspective is about personal safety. From a legal standpoint, in many places, you're allowed to try to stop a crime, but you also have a right to protect yourself. However, once the thief was subdued, the author could have called the police instead of letting him go. But they didn't, maybe because they didn't want to risk a confrontation. \n\nThe author's girlfriend and boss (an ex-cop) think they did the right thing. That's a point in their favor. The other woman was upset because she was planning to be a police officer and saw the author's inaction as a problem. But the author's response was that they weren't willing to risk their life for that amount. \n\nIs there a moral obligation to go beyond what's necessary for self-defense? The author was in a position to stop the theft but chose not to escalate when the thief decided to flee. Maybe the author's decision was a reasonable assessment of the risk. On the other hand, some might argue that once the thief was caught, the author should have held on until help arrived. But the author didn't see any other people around to assist, which adds to the risk.\n\nIn the end, the author's actions led to the thief escaping, which caused the other woman to be upset. The author's justification is about personal safety and practicality. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong. If the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances, then they might not be in the wrong. But if they should have taken more steps despite the risk, then maybe they are. But given that they were a bouncer with some training and chose to let go to avoid a dangerous situation, it seems like a reasonable decision. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
