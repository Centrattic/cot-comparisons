As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn\u2019t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n\u201cI won\u2019t have the element of surprise the second time\u201d\n\u201cThere are no other men around to help if things go bad.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cBest case scenario: I\u2019m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don\u2019t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWorst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn\u2019t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says \u201cthis is the reason I\u2019m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!\u201d \n\nI yell back \u201cFuck you!\u201d and nothing more. She didn\u2019t like that very much. She said \u201csay it again! I\u2019m on the phone with the cops!\u201d Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I\u2019m still wondering if I should\u2019ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a thief taking a Salvation Army bucket, and the author stops him but then lets him go when he doesn't fight back.\n\nFirst, the author intervened by grabbing the thief and stopping him initially. That seems like a good action. But then when the thief goes for the bucket and runs off, the author decides not to chase. The key question is whether the author had a duty to pursue further. \n\nThe author mentions their training and the risks involved. They considered the possibility of getting hurt, which is a valid concern. The Salvation Army bucket likely has some money, but it's a non-profit, so the financial loss is minimal. The other woman is upset, but the author's girlfriend and boss support them. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about assessing risk versus reward. They think about personal safety and not wanting to put themselves in danger for a small amount of money. That makes sense. Also, the other woman's aggressive reaction and the threat of calling the cops led them to leave, which might have been a good choice to avoid escalation.\n\nThe part where they yell \"Fuck you!\" could be seen as reactive, but the other woman was confrontational. The author's decision to prioritize their safety over chasing the thief further isn't necessarily wrong, especially without legal obligation to do more. \n\nIn the end, the author's judgment call seems reasonable given the circumstances. They acted initially to stop the theft but chose not to escalate the situation further, which can be seen as responsible.\n"
