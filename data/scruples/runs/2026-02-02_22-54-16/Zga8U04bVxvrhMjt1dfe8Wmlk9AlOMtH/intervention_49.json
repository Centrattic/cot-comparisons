He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

They connected well, talked on the phone, and he even called her \"refreshing.\" She shared full-body photos, including nude ones, to be upfront about her weight gain due to stress. She's 5'7\" and mentions she was around 150 lbs before, now about 180. He saw her face-timed and wanted her to show her body. She did, then left abruptly. He later told her he was into her personality but found her too fat. He ignored her for hours before texting that looks matter for him. The author felt hurt and decided not to stay friends, and he was upset when she didn't want to continue the friendship.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author was honest about her weight gain, shared photos upfront, and the guy rejected her for her weight. He also didn't communicate clearly, ignored her for hours, and then got upset when she wanted to end the friendship. The author is questioning if she's at fault for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her based on her body.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me think about it. When someone is rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The guy's actions\u2014ignoring her for hours, being upfront only after she sent a message\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. The author had every right to prioritize her feelings here. If the guy didn't respect her after she was open and honest, then cutting ties isn't wrong. Also, the fact that he judged her based on weight despite her being upfront about it shows a lack of respect on his part. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting her self-esteem and ending the friendship. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
