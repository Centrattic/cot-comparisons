He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and the guy were getting along well, both on Tinder. They had a good phone conversation, and he said she was refreshing. She sent full body pics, including nude, to be upfront about her weight gain. He initially was okay with it, even though he saw his own overweight body. Then during a face-time, she showed him her body and left abruptly. He responded by saying she's insecure because she's a bigger girl, ignored her for hours, and then came back to say looks matter and she's too fat. The author then decided not to stay friends, feeling he didn't respect her anymore for ignoring her and being rude.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. The guy's comment about her being \"too fat\" is clearly a rejection based on her body, which is hurtful. Then, the fact that he ignored her for hours after she left the call and sent a text. The author felt disrespected because he didn't just say his feelings directly but left her hanging. \n\nIn relationships, when someone feels rejected in a disrespectful way, it's common to feel hurt and want to distance themselves. The guy's actions\u2014ignoring for hours, then coming back with the rejection\u2014could be seen as poor communication. The author was upfront about her weight, and the guy's reaction was dismissive and hurtful. \n\nFriendship requires mutual respect. If the guy was inconsiderate and made her feel bad, it's understandable she wouldn't want to continue the relationship as friends. Also, after the rejection, when he seemed upset about her not wanting to stay friends, that might show he didn't take responsibility for his actions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She was honest, and the guy's behavior was disrespectful. Her decision to cut off the friendship is justified. The answer should be B.\n"
