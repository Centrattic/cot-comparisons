He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her for being \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman met a guy on Tinder, they connected well, and she was upfront about her weight gain. She sent him pictures and even showed her body during a video call. The guy then told her he found her too fat, leading to her deciding to not stay friends.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) She was transparent about her weight gain. 2) He rejected her based on her appearance despite her honesty. 3) He left her hanging for hours before communicating his rejection, which upset her. 4) She felt disrespected and chose to cut ties.\n\nNow, considering social norms and empathy, it's common for people to feel hurt when someone they're close to rejects them based on physical appearance. The man's behavior\u2014ignoring her for hours and then being upset when she didn't want to continue\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. The author's decision to not maintain a friendship after such rejection, especially given the way he handled it, seems reasonable. She's prioritizing her self-respect and emotional well-being. \n\nAdditionally, the term \"AITA\" often hinges on whether the person acted unkindly or inconsiderately. In this case, the author isn't being unkind; she's setting boundaries. The man's actions are the ones that might be questioned, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author is reacting to his rejection and the way it was handled, it's more about his actions than hers. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
