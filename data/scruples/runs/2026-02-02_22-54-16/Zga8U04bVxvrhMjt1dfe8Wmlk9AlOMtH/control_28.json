He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy rejecting her because she's \"too fat,\" and she doesn't want to stay friends. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman was upfront about her weight gain, sent pictures, and even showed her body during a video call. The guy then rejected her, saying looks matter and she's too fat. He also ignored her for hours, which upset her. She decided not to stay friends because of how he handled it.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether she's in the wrong for cutting off a friendship after being rejected for her appearance. The guy's behavior seems pretty hurtful. He didn't communicate his feelings upfront, waited hours to respond, and made a comment about her size. She felt disrespected because he was rude and then got upset when she pulled away.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's about respect and communication. The guy's actions\u2014ignoring her and then criticizing her weight\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The author isn't obligated to stay friends with someone who treats her poorly or makes her feel bad about herself. People have the right to set boundaries, especially in their personal lives and relationships.\n\nWeight-based rejection is a sensitive topic. While people can have different preferences, the way he handled the rejection (silence, then a blunt comment) is problematic. The author's reaction is about self-respect. It's not her fault if someone else's standards or behavior are hurtful. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's standing up for herself after being treated poorly. The guy's actions are more questionable here, not hers.\n"
