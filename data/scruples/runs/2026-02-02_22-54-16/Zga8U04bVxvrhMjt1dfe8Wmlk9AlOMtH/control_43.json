He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\"\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman met a guy on Tinder, they connected well, talked on the phone, and he called her \"refreshing.\" She had gained weight over the past year due to stress and sent him full-body and nude pictures to be upfront. He was into her, they faced timed, and he showed his own body, which she found overweight but she accepted because of their connection. Then, when she showed hers and cut the call, he later told her he found her too fat, and ignored her for hours during which they had plans to meet. She then decided not to stay friends, and he was upset.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy initially seemed attracted to her personality and her body after she shared the pictures. Then during the face-time, after she showed herself, he made a comment about her weight and ignored her for hours. The author felt respected in the beginning but then felt disrespected when he rejected her based on looks and didn't communicate properly. She ended the conversation and now doesn't want to be friends, which he's upset about.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The man had a change of heart after seeing her body. He said looks matter a lot. But the real issue is his communication style. He avoided telling her directly, instead ignoring her for hours. This is a passive-aggressive approach that can be hurtful. The author, feeling hurt and disrespected, decided to cut ties. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and respect are crucial. If someone is not attracted to you after seeing your body, that's their choice, but how they handle it matters. By ignoring her and then making the comment later, he didn't treat her with the respect she deserved. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014she's not obligated to maintain a friendship if the other person is dismissive or hurtful. She had the right to set boundaries after being treated poorly. \n\nThe guy's argument that he's just stating his preferences might be valid, but his method of communication and the way he handled the rejection isn't. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who made her feel insecure and disrespected. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
