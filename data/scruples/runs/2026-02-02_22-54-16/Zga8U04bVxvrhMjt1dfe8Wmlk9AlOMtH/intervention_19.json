He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat\" after they had a connection. She sent him her full-body pictures and even nude ones to be upfront. He was into her initially but later, after a face-time where she showed her body, he told her he wasn't into bigger girls and ignored her for hours before saying looks matter. She then decided not to stay friends and is wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The guy started off showing interest, they had a good rapport. The woman was proactive in being transparent about her weight gain, which is a good move. The man's response was to reject her based on her size, and then he was rude by ignoring her instead of communicating his feelings. The woman felt disrespected and decided to cut off the friendship, which makes sense given the man's behavior.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the woman's actions seem justified. She wasn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after being treated poorly. The man's rejection based on appearance is problematic, and his handling of the situation (ghosting, then coming back to say looks matter) is disrespectful. The woman's decision to end the friendship is her right, especially after how he treated her.\n\nI should consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Did the woman give him a chance to explain? She did, but he ignored her. She then gave him the benefit of the doubt by texting again, and when he finally replied, he was clear about his priorities. Her response was to leave him alone, which is a valid choice. There's no indication she acted out of malice or without cause.\n\nAlso, the fact that she was upfront about her weight shows she was considerate, which he didn't reciprocate. His behavior was inconsiderate, so her decision to walk away isn't the wrong choice. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
