He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, she met him on Tinder, and they got along well in terms of personality. He was into her being sarcastic and introverted. They talked on the phone until 2 AM, and he called her \"refreshing.\" Then, she sent him full-body pictures, including nude, to be upfront about her weight gain. He was okay with that and even showed his own body, which she found to be overweight but she accepted because of their connection. They both mentioned working on weight loss.\n\nThen, during a face-time call, he asked her to show her body again. She did, but said goodbye abruptly out of fear. He responded by saying, \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" She asked if he wanted to keep talking, and he ignored her for hours. She then told him to take her silence as an answer. Later, he texted her that \"looks really matter for me\" and she was too fat for him. She decided not to continue the friendship, feeling he didn't respect her after the rejection and the long silence. He was upset and wanted to keep talking.\n\nNow, the question is: Is she in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. She was honest about her appearance, sent pictures, and he initially accepted her. Then, after seeing her in person, he made a comment about her weight and said it matters for him. She felt hurt and decided to end the friendship, which he didn't like. She didn't want to stay friends because of how he handled the rejection and the silence. \n\nFrom a general perspective, if someone is rejected for their weight, especially after being honest and upfront, it's understandable that they might feel hurt and not want to continue a relationship. The guy's actions\u2014ignoring her for hours, making a blunt comment about her size\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. The author's decision to cut ties might be a reaction to feeling disrespected and devalued, which is a common response. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that he was just being honest, and she should respect his feelings. However, the way he handled it was poor: instead of communicating directly, he ignored her, leading to anxiety and uncertainty. The author's prioritization of her self-esteem and emotional well-being by not wanting to stay friends seems reasonable. \n\nAnother angle: Friendships can be affected by romantic rejections, especially if the person is still interested or if the rejection was harsh. The author felt that he didn't respect her after the rejection, so ending the friendship is a valid choice. \n\nSo, most people would probably side with the author here. The guy's behavior was dismissive and hurtful, so she's not in the wrong for distancing herself. Answer B.\n"
