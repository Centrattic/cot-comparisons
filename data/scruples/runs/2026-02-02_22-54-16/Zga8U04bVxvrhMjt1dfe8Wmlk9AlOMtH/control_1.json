He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girl met a guy on Tinder and they connected through texting and a phone call. She was upfront about her weight gain, even sending full body pics and being nude, which he initially seemed okay with. Then they face-timed, and when she showed her body, he made a comment about her being too fat. She felt he was rude and ignored her for hours despite having plans to meet. She then told him she would leave him alone, which upset him when he later changed his mind.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. The guy's comment about her weight is clearly hurtful and objectifying. He also ghosted her for hours when she was vulnerable, which is not respectful. The author's reaction is to cut off the friendship, which is her choice, especially after being treated poorly. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she was upfront about her weight. The guy had the chance to decide if he was attracted, and he did see her body. His rejection is his personal choice, but the way he handled it\u2014ignoring her and then making a hurtful comment\u2014was unkind. By ending the friendship, she's protecting her own emotional well-being. The guy's actions seem to be the problem here, not hers. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
