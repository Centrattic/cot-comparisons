He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, the context: They met on Tinder, connected well, talked on the phone, and both were open about their weight issues. The guy saw her body, then later told her he was rejecting her for her size. But before that, he ignored her for hours after she sent a text asking if he wanted to keep talking. The author ended the interaction because of his handling of the situation, which included the rejection and the prolonged silence.\n\nSo, the key points here are the guy's behavior. He initially showed interest, even called her \"refreshing,\" and both discussed their weight issues. Then, when he saw her body and decided he wasn't into her, he didn't communicate that clearly. Instead, he ghosted her for six hours, which is a big part of why she's upset. Ghosting is generally considered disrespectful because it leaves the other person hanging without closure.\n\nThe guy later tells her that looks matter to him, and he was upset when she didn't want to stay friends. The author's response was to cut ties, which is understandable given the emotional hurt from being ignored and then rejected. \n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. If the guy was honest about his preferences after initially engaging, but his method of rejection (ignoring for hours and then being abrupt) is what caused her to want to end the friendship, then she's not the one at fault. People have the right to set boundaries based on how they're treated. The guy's behavior was disrespectful, and her reaction is a form of self-respect. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was upfront about her weight and he still continued the conversation before the rejection suggests that the issue wasn't about the truth but his personal preference. She wasn't lying, so there's no deceit here. His choice to end the connection is his own, but the way he did it is poor. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the person who is blamed for the conflict. Here, the conflict arises from his rejection and ghosting, not her initial decision to part ways. She didn't do anything wrong; she was honest and tried to handle the situation respectfully. His actions led to the hurt, so she's justified in not wanting to maintain a friendship with someone who treated her that way.\n"
