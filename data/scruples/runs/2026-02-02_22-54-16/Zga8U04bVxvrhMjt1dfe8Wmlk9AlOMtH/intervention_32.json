He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rejecting a guy who was honest about her weight gain and then he rejected her for being \"too fat\" after seeing her body.\n\nFirst, the author was upfront. She sent full body pictures, even nude, to let him decide if he was attracted. That seems responsible. He was into her personality, and they had a good connection. Then during a face-time, he wanted to see her body again. She showed him, and he made a comment about her being bigger. Then he ignored her for hours, which upset her. When she finally gave up, he came back saying looks matter and she's too fat. She decided not to stay friends because of his behavior.\n\nThe key points here are honesty from both sides. The author was transparent about her weight gain. The guy, however, after the initial connection, couldn't get past her appearance. He didn't handle it well by ignoring her instead of being upfront. That lack of communication is a big issue. The author felt disrespected because he didn't just say no directly. She then decided to end the friendship, which makes sense given his actions. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she didn't do anything unethical. She was honest. He made the choice to prioritize looks and then handled the rejection poorly. The author's decision to cut ties is a personal choice. People have the right to choose who they want to be friends with, especially after such treatment. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's behavior was worse here. She was upfront, he wasn't respectful with his communication. Ending the friendship is reasonable.\n"
