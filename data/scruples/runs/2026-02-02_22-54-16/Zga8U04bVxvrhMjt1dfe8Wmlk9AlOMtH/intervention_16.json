He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and the guy met on Tinder, really connected via phone calls and chats, and they both discussed their weight issues and were working on losing weight. The author sent full body pictures, including nude, upfront to be honest about her appearance. Then they face-timed, and when he saw her in person, he told her she's too fat. But his response was pretty poor\u2014he ignored her for hours instead of being upfront and then got upset when she didn't want to stay friends.\n\nSo the main points here are: the author was transparent about her weight, the guy gave mixed signals (initially attracted, then rejection), and his handling of the rejection was disrespectful. The author felt disrespected and chose to end the friendship, which the guy then seemed to resent. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nIn the AITA context, staying friends after a rejection that's based on appearance might be tricky. But the guy's behavior was definitely poor\u2014he didn't communicate his feelings properly, leading to the author's hurt. The author's decision to not stay friends could be seen as self-respecting, especially since the guy was okay with her weight before but changed his stance after seeing her in person. Also, the guy's comment about her being a \"bigger girl\" and the awkwardness of the situation might make the author feel that the guy was being cruel or dismissive.\n\nConsidering that people often have the right to set boundaries after being treated poorly, the author's choice to cut off the friendship seems justified. The guy's actions contributed to the author's hurt, so she's not at fault for prioritizing her self-esteem and comfort.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
