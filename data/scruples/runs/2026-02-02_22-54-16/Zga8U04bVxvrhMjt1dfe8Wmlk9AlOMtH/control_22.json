He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 21-year-old woman who met a guy on Tinder. They connected well, talked on the phone, and he called her \"refreshing.\" The woman had gained some weight over the past year due to stress, and she was upfront about her body by sending full-body and nude pictures. The guy was into her initially. Then, during a FaceTime call, he asked her to show her body again, and after she did, he said she was \"too fat\" and that looks matter to him. He ignored her for hours before finally texting her, which upset her. She decided not to stay friends because of his handling of the situation, his delay in communication, and his focus on her weight.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with him. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nFirst, let's consider the guy's actions. He rejected her for her weight, which is a common but hurtful issue. People often base attraction on physical appearance, but it's still a sensitive topic. The way he handled the rejection matters. He ignored her for six hours when she was trying to communicate, which caused her to feel disrespected and upset. His response after the FaceTime call was abrupt and focused on her weight, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe author was upfront about her weight gain and her efforts to lose weight. She showed him her body and was honest. He then decided she was \"too fat,\" which is his personal preference, but how he communicated it was poor. Ignoring her for hours and then just stating his preference without empathy could be seen as rude or dismissive.\n\nThe author felt that his actions showed he didn't respect her anymore once he wasn't attracted to her. She didn't want to stay friends because of his behavior. The key here is whether she has a right to feel that way. If someone is unkind or disrespectful in their rejection, it's reasonable for the other person to distance themselves. The guy's actions could be seen as contributing to the breakdown in the relationship. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own feelings and self-respect in this situation.\n\nAnother angle: the guy wanted to meet later that night during the hours he was ignoring her, which suggests he was available but chose not to respond. That could be interpreted as cruel, especially in a situation where the woman was anxious and trying to get a response. His lack of communication would have been hurtful, and her reaction is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends. The guy's handling of the situation was poor, and she's justified in her feelings. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
