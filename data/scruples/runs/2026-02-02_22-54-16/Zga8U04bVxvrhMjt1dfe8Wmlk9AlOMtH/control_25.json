He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation starts with the author, a 21-year-old woman, meeting a guy on Tinder. They seem to connect well, talking on the phone and building a rapport. The key issue comes when they face-time, and the guy ends up rejecting her because she's \"too fat,\" after she had been upfront about her weight gain. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had shared her body images, including nude, to be transparent. She also mentioned her weight gain due to stress and her efforts to lose weight. The guy then wanted to see her body during the face-time, which she did. After that, he didn't respond immediately, leading her to send a message taking his silence as an answer. Later, he told her he found her too fat. \n\nHe rejected her for her appearance, which is a weight-based rejection. The author then decides not to stay friends, feeling disrespected. The key points here are: was she wrong to cut ties? Let's break it down.\n\nThe guy's behavior is questionable. He initially seemed attracted, showed his own body, and then later rejected her for her size. His silence for hours before responding could be seen as inconsiderate, adding emotional distress. The author felt disrespected and decided to distance herself, which is a common reaction to rejection based on superficial reasons. \n\nSociety often stigmatizes weight, and being rejected for it can be hurtful. The author's decision to not continue the friendship because of his handling of the situation seems justified. She's standing up for herself after being treated poorly. The guy's actions\u2014ignoring her, then rejecting her for her weight\u2014don't reflect respect. \n\nHowever, sometimes people argue that after a romantic rejection, staying friends could be mature. But in this case, the rejection was based on appearance, and the way he handled it was hurtful. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her self-respect and emotional well-being. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
